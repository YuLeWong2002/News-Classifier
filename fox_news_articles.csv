A social media influencer has filed a lawsuit against Miami Dolphins star wide receiver Tyreek Hill, claiming he fractured her leg, which required ""surgery with orthopedic reconstruction and hardware implantation.""
Sophie Hall, a 35-year-old plus-size model and influencer, is seeking over $50,000 in damages after alleging Hill was ""enraged"" after being ""humiliated"" by Hall during a ""friendly football lesson"" at his Miami mansion, causing the leg fracture.
""Ms. Hall now brings this action to recover compensatory and punitive damages for the significant harm that Mr. Hill caused by his intentional and reckless misconduct,"" the lawsuit, filed in Broward County Court Feb. 23, states in its introduction.

Hall is suing Hill for battery, assault and negligence.
Hall, a native of Britain who has over 2 million followers across her multiple social platforms, provided Instagram screenshots of her introduction to Hill, which she claims never happened until she purchased a ticket for her son to attend the Dolphins receiver’s ""Tyreek Hill Football Camp"" June 17, 2023.
A May 24, 2023, interaction over social media included Hill messaging ""in a flirtatious and playful manner"" by saying Hall wasn’t 6-foot-1, which is in her social media bio. Hill replied after Hall made it known she purchased the ticket for the camp, saying she would be ""towering over everyone"" and ""I’ve been know [sic] to be a good stepdad.""
TYREEK HILL FIRES ‘BONEHEAD’ STAFFER WHO DOLPHINS STAR SAYS MISTAKENLY FILED DIVORCE PAPERS
Hall claims that Hill gave her his phone number, and after the camp in June, he invited her over to his house. The lawsuit continues by stating Hill provided flight and travel arrangements for Hall to spend time with him at his mansion June 28, 2023.
Hall claims that Hill worked out with his football trainer on a turf field at his mansion, and after his session was over, he ""invited Ms. Hall to participate in offensive line drills with him.""
""Defendant Hill asked Ms. Hall to stand in a defensive line stance while he stood opposite her in an offensive lineman stance, ‘hiked’ the ball to the quarterback, and told her to rush him as if she wanted to chase the quarterback,"" the lawsuit states. ""Ms. Hall did as instructed and on contact with the Defendant, caused Hill to be pushed backwards, garnering laughter from the witnesses present at the time, including the Defendant’s mother, sister, friend and trainer.""

Hall alleges that Hill’s ""attitude changed and he became angry,"" while setting up for another play. This time, Hill was allegedly in the defensive line position, and ""Ms. Hall held her own against Mr. Hill.""
On a fourth play, Hall claims to have remained the offensive lineman as Hill played the pass rusher. This time, Hill allegedly ""charged into her violently and with great force, resulting in significant and serious injuries.""
""The crushing force was so great that she sustained a right leg fracture, necessitating surgery with metal hardware implantation,"" the lawsuit states.

Hill allegedly downplayed the injury and ""simply told her to rest and offered her a bed to lay down and ice her leg."" Hall remained at Hill’s home until travel arrangements could be made to return home a couple days later.
After Hill ""failed to get her any medical attention or treatment at any time,"" Hall returned home, where she saw an orthopedist on July 1, 2023. She was diagnosed with a right leg fracture.
Despite ""weekly physical therapy sessions"" and visits to a specialist, Hall claims she still has ""persistent pain and weakness in her lower extremities.""
""Defendant Hill’s aggression towards Ms. Hall is consistent with his history of violent and aggressive behavior towards women,"" the lawsuit also states.

Hill has had a controversial off-the-field past, including a 2014 incident when he was kicked off his Oklahoma State football team after being charged with felony domestic assault and battery by strangulation. His girlfriend at the time, Crystal Espinal, said she was choked and punched in the stomach and face by Hill.
Espinal was eight weeks pregnant with Hill’s child at the time. Hill eventually pleaded guilty to the charges and a plea agreement with the district attorney’s office led to three years probation.
Hill has also been involved in child abuse allegations, including a case in 2019 for which he was suspended by the Kansas City Chiefs. He was eventually reinstated after he pleaded his innocence and a district attorney determined there wasn’t sufficient evidence he had broken son Zev Carter’s arm.
Hill has also dealt with multiple paternity lawsuits, one of which is pending in Broward County Court after a May 15, 2023, filing and another reopened in the same court from a Jan. 17, 2023, filing.

"February 23, 2024 4:23pm EST",Former NFL first round draft pick Brady Quinn predicts Michigan's JJ McCarthy will be selected in top-10,Fox News,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
The 2024 NFL Draft is widely expected to feature one of the best quarterback classes in recent memory. USC Trojans star Caleb Williams headlines this year's class of prospects and is widely expected to be the first player selected in April.
North Carolina signal caller Drake Maye and LSU's Jayden Daniels are expected to hear their names called shortly after Williams walks across the stage at the draft in Detroit. Washington quarterback Michael Penix Jr. also received some first-round consideration, although his injury history could give some teams pause.
JJ McCarthy, who helped lead the Michigan Wolverines to the College Football Playoff National Championship in January, has also declared for the upcoming draft.

McCarthy's skillet and overall production was not quite as prolific as the other quarterbacks in this year's class. Consequently, he has received multiple second or third round grades from draft analysis. However, a former college football star quarterback who was taken in the first round believes that McCarthy will be a day-one selection.
MICHIGAN’S JJ MCCARTHY ESTIMATES ‘80%’ OF COLLEGE FOOTBALL PROGRAMS STEAL SIGNS
Brady Quinn shared his thoughts on McCarthy and predicted that the former Michigan football star will ultimately land with a team that is drafting within the top 10.
""To me, he's going to end up being a top 10 pick when it's all said and done,"" Quinn said on CBS Sports HQ. ""I think teams are going to love his ability to create and his ability to take off and run, too.""

McCarthy has become one of the most fascinating prospects to discuss at this point in the pre-draft process. His stock has seemingly risen over the past few weeks.
He also still has the opportunity to try and impress teams at the upcoming combine and his pro day.

Michigan relied heavily on its running backs during McCarthy's tenure, but he did show the ability to make accurate throws.
Quinn acknowledged the offensive structure that McCarthy played in at Michigan, but also pointed to his ability to showcase his talent when it was necessary.

""This is a team that's really run the football incredibly well,"" Quinn said in reference to the Wolverines offense.
""[McCarthy] hasn't had to necessarily dominate games. I'll still go back to when he's had to do it, he's showcased the ability to. ... He's able to layer the ball which is another thing you always hear talked about this time of year. The ability to get it over one defender, but in front of the next or inside a tight window. He showcases all of that. We just didn't see it as much as we saw with a lot of other quarterbacks who threw the football more.""

Christopher Bell took advantage of Martin Truex Jr.’s late decision to pit under a green flag and won the Shriners Children’s 500 at Phoenix Raceway on Sunday.
Bell had more than a six-second lead over Chris Buescher and Ty Gibbs with 10 laps to go as he hoped for no cautions before the white flag. His prayers were answered, and he was able to guide the No. 20 Toyota Camry to Victory Lane and pick up some crucial points early in the Cup Series season.

Bell was 20th on the final restart and worked his way up to the front.
""This one feels really good,"" he told FOX Sports. ""You don’t get cars like that every often – just super, super proud, proud to be on this (No.) 20 car. This Rheem Camry was amazing today. I feel like we have capability of running races like this a lot.""
""Hopefully, this is the first of many this year.""
Gibbs and Buescher fought for second place down the stretch, with both of them being too far behind Bell to catch up. But the No. 17 was able to hold off Gibbs for second. Brad Keselowski and defending NASCAR Cup Series champion Ryan Blaney rounded out the top five.

WILLIAM BYRON'S CAR HAD BEER CAN 'STUCK' IN AIR FILTER AT LAS VEGAS, CREW CHIEF SAYS
Truex Jr.’s gamble to stay on the track with the lead while the rest of the leaders pitted didn’t pay off. He needed to change his tires with 41 laps to go and gave up his lead. He fell right off the top 15 as soon as he got to pit road, but he was able to claw his way back. He finished in seventh.
It was Bell’s seventh win of his career. He won two in 2023: at Bristol for the dirt race and at Homestead-Miami. His win also helped negate two straight poor finishes in 2024.
After finishing third at Daytona, he was 34th at Atlanta and 33rd in Las Vegas.
Despite winning two out of the first three races, Hendrick Motorsports had a tough day at the track as Kyle Larson finished the best out of all of his teammates. He was in 11th. His teammate, William Byron, who won the Daytona 500, finished 18th.
Bell won Stage 2 and Tyler Reddick won Stage 1.

Pro wrestling legend Tammy Sytch, better known as Sunny during her time in WWE, opened up about her life at a Florida prison as she serves a 17-year sentence over a deadly crash.
Sytch, 51, was sentenced in November for the 2022 crash in Daytona Beach. She pleaded no contest to several charges, including driving with a suspended license, DUI, DUI with damage to person and DUI with damage to property.

She appeared on the ""Bird Calls"" podcast and talked about her experience in prison. She said she was moved to Lowell Correction Institution and was asked a myriad of questions about her day-to-day life behind bars.
Sytch was asked whether anyone from the prison knew about her life and career in pro wrestling. She said before she moved from county lockup she was receiving asks from other inmates about signing personal items – everything from her prison ID to her underwear.
""One girl asked for my prison ID, for me to sign it so she could take it home and sell it on eBay. And I said no,"" she said. ""And then another girl, believe it or not, had the b---- to ask me for my underwear, to sign my underwear, so she can bring it home and sell it on eBay. I was like, absolutely not.""
Sytch also dished on her sex life – or lack thereof.

FORMER WWE STAR ADMITS TO FAILING MULTIPLE DRUG TESTS DUE TO COCAINE USE
""I love men, but when you're here you really don't have an option. If you want any kind of affection or connection with anyone, it's a girl-girl thing, you have no choice. But there's really nobody that would be up to par for me, so I might have to wait a little while until somebody of quality comes in.""
Sytch was asked what life was like without having sex.
""It's already been 22 months without it and let me tell you it's rough. It’s like you become a virgin again, it's insane,"" she added.
Sytch performed in WWE under the moniker Sunny. She became wildly popular and is known in pro wrestling as the first WWE diva. However, since 2012, she’s built up a lengthy rap sheet, which includes multiple DUI arrests in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.
In March 2022, she was arrested on DUI charges for an accident that left a 75-year-old Florida man dead.

Sherman was arrested three years ago outside of his in-laws' house in Redmond and faced charges of driving under the influence and two domestic-violence-related misdemeanors.
After that arrest, police said Sherman crashed his SUV in a construction zone and tried to break into his in-laws’ suburban Seattle home.
His father-in-law, Raymond Moss, told officers he armed himself with a handgun and fired pepper spray at Sherman to protect his family.
At the time, Sherman said he was ""deeply remorseful for my actions"" and that he ""behaved in a manner that I am not proud of."" He said he had been ""dealing with some personal challenges over the last several months, but that is not an excuse for how I acted.""

After a rough week in the hospital, Steve ""Mongo"" McMichael apparently received good news Wednesday.

The son of Walter Payton, McMichael's former Chicago Bears teammate, revealed the news in a post on X.

McMichael's publicist, Betsy Shepherd, told The Associated Press the same about McMichael's status.
McMichael went to the hospital last week with what the family thought was pneumonia. However, it was later revealed he developed MRSA and a urinary tract infection, forcing him to undergo a blood transfusion.
The family said Friday he was responding to antibiotics, was having fluid removed from his lungs and was expected to be released in the coming days.

The origin story of Jake Knapp, the PGA Tour's most recent winner at the Mexico Open, is one of the more interesting on the way to earning a tour card.
For most golfers trying to reach the highest levels of play all over the world, it is common to work various jobs to help pay for travel and compete in various tournaments.
Knapp, who was running out of funding for golf, worked as a nightclub bouncer to make the money necessary to keep that dream of going pro alive.

The story goes like this for Knapp. After losing his Korn Ferry Tour card in 2021, Knapp was looking for ways to make some quick cash. So, he decided to become a bouncer at a nightclub for nine months.
While one may shake their head at this career choice, Knapp was able to work on his golf game during the day and get work done at night as well. He would use the money he made at night to participate in mini-tour events as well as PGA Tour Canada tournaments.
Knapp did not want to be at the front of a nightclub checking IDs for patrons, but he always had golf on his mind.

""I was the one standing at the front door checking IDs and doing all that kind of stuff,"" he said on ""The Smylie Show"" with fellow PGA Tour winner Smylie Kaufman. ""And it was like, ‘Man, what am I doing here?’ This isn’t what I’m supposed to be doing, but I had somebody give me a good piece of advice. ‘You are where you are for a reason. If you don’t want to be there, work your way out of it.’""
Knapp eventually got back to the Korn Ferry Tour last year, and he was able to secure his PGA Tour card this year.
Now 29 years old, Knapp can say he is a PGA Tour champion, finishing 19-under at Vidanta Vallarta in his ninth career start.

Knapp did not have the prettiest final round of the tournament, but he got the job done, shooting even-par 71 to hold off Finland’s Sami Valimaki, who finished 17-under to claim second place. Valimaki had a chance to potentially force a playoff when he stepped up to the par-5 18th hole, but his tee shot ended up underneath a fence. He was forced to take relief, which meant giving up one stroke.
From there, Knapp tapped in his final putt and the celebration ensued.
Knapp’s impressive third round, which included a front-nine 28 after seven birdies, saw him finish 8-under for the day to take the lead heading into the final round Sunday.
Of course, Knapp wants to continue playing well to remain in the Top 60, which would secure a spot at this year's U.S. Open. However, he will be sure to take a step back and celebrate not just the win, but the bumpy road it took to get to this point in his career.

"February 27, 2024 4:00am EST",Caitlin Clark mirrors ‘Pistol’ Pete Maravich in more ways than one,Fox News,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Jaeson Maravich was visiting his mom Jackie in Covington, Louisiana, near New Orleans during the Final Four last year.
""Jaeson,"" she called to him from the living room. ""You need to see this girl play.""
Jackie apparently has an eye for basketball. She met Pistol Pete Maravich at LSU in the late 1960s and married him in 1976 when he was an NBA star - just 12 years before he died of an undetected heart defect while playing pick-up basketball at age 40.
What Jaeson, who was 9 when his dad died, saw on television last spring was shocking - some sort of a long lost relative in more ways than one.

""I was really impressed right off. She's the real deal,"" Maravich told OutKick last week. ""And she looks like she could be a cousin or something. There is definitely a resemblance to my dad - the lanky build and real dark eyes. She shoots from 30 or 35 feet like he did, and she passes the ball like a magician. Not as flashy, but a real good ball handler, too. And no one could guard her.""
Jackie and Jaeson Maravich saw on ESPN that Friday night, March 31, was what much of the nation saw. An average of 5.5 million watched, which was the most viewers for a college basketball game on ESPN - men or women - since the Duke-North Carolina men's game in 2008.
What the Maraviches saw was skinny, lanky, point guard Caitlin Clark of No. 2 Iowa score 41 points with eight assists and six rebounds to upset No. 1 and 36-0 South Carolina, 77-73, in a national semifinal at the Final Four in Dallas. Clark became the first player in women's NCAA Tournament history to score 40 points or more in back-to-back games and just the second player to score 40 or more in a Final Four game.
Maravich averaged an NCAA record 44.2 points a game in his three-year college career from 1967-70 when freshmen were not eligible. And there was no 3-point shot.
""I don't keep up with women's basketball, so I was like, ‘Who is this?’ I mean, she was hitting from 30 feet,"" Jaeson Maravich said. ""She can stop on a dime from 25 or 30 feet. She's very unpredictable. She has great composure and confidence and really is an all-around player like dad.""
Maravich's career shooting percentage was .438. Clark's is .465.
And Clark, a native of Des Moines, Iowa, who is not related to the Maravich family, is just 51 points away from breaking Maravich's NCAA career scoring record of 3,667 points. The senior point guard scored 24 with 15 rebounds and 10 assists in a 101-85 win over Illinois Sunday. She is at 3,617 points now in her four-year college career.
No. 4 Iowa (24-4, 13-3 Big Ten) plays at Minnesota (15-12, 5-11 Big Ten) on Wednesday (9 p.m., Peacock) before hosting No. 2 Ohio State (23-3, 14-1 Big Ten) on Sunday (1 p.m., FOX). She averages 32 points a game this season and hit a career-high 49 on Feb. 15 against Michigan when she broke the NCAA women's career scoring record.
Maravich played in only 83 games in his college career. Clark has played in 128 with two regular season games to go, potentially three in the Big Ten Tournament and six in the NCAA Tournament. Clark could stay at Iowa for a fifth season in 2024-25 because of the extra-year rule from COVID in 2020 when she was a freshman.
JAY WILLIAMS TELLS CRITICS TO 'PLEASE STOP WITH ALL THIS RACE BAITING S---' OVER CAITLIN CLARK HOT TAKE
Maravich also holds the NCAA record for most career games of 50 points or more with 28. Clark leads the nation in scoring (32.4 points a game), in assists (8.5 a game) and in 3-pointers (5.3 a game).
Since Maravich shot so often from beyond the 3-point line without knowing it, it has been estimated that he would have scored more than 4,500 points in his career. Throw in the 771 he scored as a freshman in 1966-67, and he would have 5,271 points. And that's excluding however many 3-pointers he would have had his freshman year.
""It's two different records,"" Maravich said. ""But I'm happy for her. She's a great player and deserves whatever she gets. She is a good person, and it's a great thing for the younger generation. It's cool how they have similar games.""
People often do not realize that Maravich was a big guard at 6-foot-5 who averaged 6.5 rebounds and 5.1 assists a game at LSU. Clark, a taller guard in the women's game as well at 6-0, has averaged 7.1 rebounds and 8.1 assists a game in her career.

And they have similar angular, thin faces.
""It's funny how they look alike,"" Maravich said.
While Maravich was known for his floppy hair and socks, Clark has been called ""Ponytail Pete.""
""I saw somebody called me ‘Ponytail Pete.’ I thought that was kind of funny,"" Clark said at the Final Four last year. ""I think just a tremendous compliment. I am familiar with his game. I've seen a lot of his highlights. I take a lot of pride in being able to do a lot of different things for my team. I think the passing can get overlooked at times.""
Ironically, it was LSU that ended Clark's and Iowa's season last year in the national championship game - 102-85.
Maravich and LSU also made the Final Four in 1970. The prestigious National Invitation Tournament Final Four at the time, that is, at Madison Square Garden in New York with Army, St. John's and eventual champion Marquette, which beat LSU in the semi and St. John's for the title.
Much like Maravich did throughout the Southeastern Conference, Clark is selling out road arenas as often as the Carver-Hawkeye Arena in Iowa City.
Both are iconic Americana. During particularly spectacular games, road fans would cheer for Maravich. The same thing has happened for Clark this season throughout the Big Ten.
Maravich never won a national championship or an NBA title. But he has been lauded for decades as one of the greatest players in history - if not the greatest. Clark may not win a national title, either, but her legacy already seems secure by many.
""He'd make up shots in the air,"" Los Angeles Lakers great Magic Johnson said of Maravich. ""The no-look passes, dribble the ball, then pat it with one hand and pass. That's where I got that from. He was the greatest. He changed the game. He was before his time. He did what I did long before I did.""

Former Duke star and ESPN analyst Jay Bilas put Clark on Maravich's level.
""She's a cultural phenomenon unlike anything we've ever seen in basketball in my view,"" he said on a recent ESPN college basketball GameDay. ""And it goes beyond the scoring record. She's not elevated the women's game. She's elevated the game. In that regard, we will not see her like again, in my judgment.""
Maravich is believed to have pushed young boys to basketball courts around the country in the 1960s, ‘70s and ’80s like no other player.
""Can you imagine the young girls who are looking at Clark  right now and dreaming in a way that they've never dreamed before about the game?,"" Bilas said.
A popular Clark comparison is to Golden State's Steph Curry.
""I don't compare her to Steph Curry,"" ESPN GameDay's Seth Greenberg said. ""I compare her to Pistol Pete Maravich. Her passing, her basketball IQ. Like Maravich, she makes it easier for everyone else on the floor. Like Pete, she sees plays before they happen.""
Clark has already seen herself breaking Maravich's record.

""Before every game, I try to take time and just visualize what I want to happen in the game,"" she said recently on ESPN. ""I'm somebody who has really big dreams and aspirations.""
So too did Maravich.
""Love never fails. Character never quits,"" he said. ""And with patience and persistence, dreams do come true.""
But they are two different records.
""She's a fantastic player - maybe the best women's player ever,"" said Bob Remy, who was the official scorekeeper for every New Orleans Jazz home game Maravich played in from 1974-79. ""She's a better passer than shooter, which is how Pete was. He was a better scorer than he was a shooter, too. He was a showman. She puts on a show. And I hope she gets it. The only way I could be upset is if they consider that breaking Pete's record. Different times. Different game. No 3-pointer when he played.""

The Detroit Pistons are having one of the worst years in franchise history, and general manager Troy Weaver started to hear it from the fan base in person instead of on social media on Saturday.
A video caught Weaver yelling back at a heckling fan in the stands of the Little Caesars Arena. It came in the midst of the Pistons’ 142-124 loss to the Dallas Mavericks.

Weaver motioned over to the ushers to remove the fan. The man told one usher that Weaver ""threatened"" him. The Pistons general manager declined to comment on the incident, according to The Associated Press.
Jeffrey Calloway, a season-ticket holder from Detroit, broke down the incident in an interview with the AP.
""The guy that was in the incident, with the Red Wings stuff on, came over and was pointing at the scoreboard earlier in the game,"" Calloway said. ""Troy Weaver just shrugged his shoulders and said, ‘OK,’ and the guy went back to his seat.

Security guards later escorted the fan from his seat.
The Pistons set a record earlier in the year with 28 consecutive losses. They have 10 wins this season.

If the Pistons do not manage to get at least 16 wins this season, it would be the worst year for them in franchise history. Detroit was 16-66 during the 1979-80 season and only won 17 games last year.

Prior to their recent string of injuries, the New York Knicks were the talk of the NBA.
During one stretch, from Jan. 17 to Feb. 1, the Knickerbockers won nine straight games, putting them in the conversation for the second seed in the East, behind only the dominant Boston Celtics.
However, with injuries to Julius Randle, OG Anunoby and Jalen Brunson, they've fallen on hard times, losing nine of their last 13 games.

They're missing Randle, a two-time All-Star, who has a dislocated shoulder. And although he was on the team for a short time, Anunoby provided a much-needed three-and-D after he was acquired from the Toronto Raptors.
The Knicks have been scratching and clawing with makeshift lineups, prompting some players like Deuce McBride, who normally comes off the bench, to play 47 and 46 minutes his last two games.
So, they could, and will, look much different in time for the playoffs. But one NBA legend isn't buying it.
Paul Pierce said the Knicks are impressive from the outside looking in, but it seems like he thinks they can be figured out.
""The Knicks are like an Instagram model,"" Pierce said on his podcast with former teammate Kevin Garnett.

""It’s two different things — reality versus digital?"" Garnett asked his former teammate. ""So, what am I watching on TV then?""
""An Instagram model. They got that Fashion Nova on,"" Pierce replied, predicting a first-round exit.
New York holds the fifth seed in the Eastern Conference but is just a half-game ahead of a play-in spot (seeds 7 through 10). New York is 36-26, while the Miami Heat and Joel Embiid-less Philadelphia 76ers are 35-26. The Knicks have the same record as the Orlando Magic, who own the tiebreaker for the fourth seed.

"February 29, 2024 6:55am EST",NBA Draft prospect Isaiah Collier says Trojans 'gelled as one' after Bronny James' health scare,Fox News,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
One of the biggest, and scariest, stories of the summer was when Bronny James, the son of LeBron, suffered a cardiac arrest during a workout.
He was with several of his USC teammates at Galen Center on July 24 when the incident occurred. He was discharged two days later, and LeBron said his son underwent surgery.
Bronny's hospitalization came about six-and-a-half months after Damar Hamlin's on-field collapse – that was a case of commotio cortis after he tackled Tee Higgins.
According to the American Heart Association, commotio cordis is caused by ""an extremely rare consequence of blunt force trauma to the heart that happens at exactly the wrong time in the heart rhythm, causing the heart to stop beating effectively.""

But for James, it was different, as he was simply just running some drills before a 911 call was made.
As scary as the incident was, though, James' teammate, potential NBA Draft lottery pick Isaiah Collier, said the Trojans couldn't dwell on the situation.
Instead of being scared, they knew they had to move on and come together – and that's exactly what they did.

""I can’t really speak on everybody else, but I feel like we all gelled as one. Came back, we just stuck together, to be honest,"" Collier said in a recent interview with Fox News Digital.
Doctors revealed that the cardiac arrest was likely caused by a ""congenital heart defect."" He was cleared for basketball activity in late November and made his college debut on Dec. 10.
James committed to USC in May. He chose the Trojans over Ohio State and Oregon. He was the 33rd ranked player in his class, and he was named a McDonald's All-American last year.

Australian soccer star Sam Kerr was charged with racially aggravated harassment in January after an incident last year with a police officer in southwest London.
Kerr pleaded not guilty to the charge, prosecutors in Britain said Monday. Police said the incident involved an officer who was responding to a complaint about a taxi fare, according to Britain’s PA news agency. Kerr is set to face court over the charge in February 2025.

Kerr has been playing in the Women’s Super League for Chelsea. She’s the captain of the Australian national women’s team but has been sidelined after suffering an ACL injury during training camp earlier this month. Chelsea has not commented on the incident.
Football Australia CEO James Johnson and women’s team coach Tony Gustavsson told Australian media they were only made aware of the charges against Kerr on Tuesday.
""We’re trying to get to the bottom of it. We have our own questions we would like to know,"" Johnson said in a press conference. ""There is a process that is under way and that process needs to run its course.
""I don’t want to get into the allegations. They are serious allegations. At the same time, Sam has rights – natural justice rights, procedural rights – that she has to work her way through, and we respect that.""

Football Australia said it was aware of the proceedings involving Kerr but was unable to comment on the ongoing legal matter.

Joseph O'Pella was the Philadelphia Eagles' trainer throughout Jason Kelce's entire career, and the two formed a special bond.
Being the center, Kelce was constantly taped up, notably his fingers and ankles, in what became an iconic look in Philadelphia.
O'Pella has been battling cancer, and treatments have kept him away from the team, but Kelce wanted to make him feel right at home.

""In what would be his final season, when I was diagnosed with cancer and had to undergo radiation and chemo, he offered his shore house if I needed to get away, and offered to pay for real services to help my wife and I out, and he called me randomly when I had been home, too sick to come in [because] of chemo, just to check on me and chat about random things,"" O'Pella wrote in an Instagram post. ""That's who he is as a person.""
However, that was the least Kelce could do.
One of those days O'Pella was ""too sick to come in"" was the wild card round against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. It turned out to be Kelce's final game, as the Birds lost 32-9 to the Bucs and were eliminated from the playoffs.
That meant O'Pella, who ""taped this guy's ankles and thumbs every day for 13 years,"" was not able to treat Kelce like he had a bunch of other game days.

"February 28, 2024 6:01pm EST",Massachusetts school rips 'harmful comments' made toward transgender athlete accused of injuring opponent,Fox News,"Independent Women's Forum's Riley Gaines reacts to a female high school basketball player being injured by a transgender opponent on ""Jesse Watters Primetime.""
KIPP Academy Lynn, a Massachusetts private school, remains steadfast in its decision to allow a transgender student to play for the girls’ basketball team despite recent backlash after a video showed the player hurting an opponent.
KIPP Academy saw Collegiate Charter School of Lowell forfeit a game at halftime this month after three players were hurt, one of which was caught on video that showed a transgender player wrestling for a rebound and tossing their opponent hard on the court. The Collegiate Charter player appeared to suffer a back injury.
The now-viral video led KIPP Academy’s executive director, Rhonda Barnes, to blast ""harmful comments"" that were made about the student and the school.

""To the best of our knowledge, this student has never been on a men’s team at KIPP,"" Barnes told the Boston Globe, while also confirming the player identifies as transgender.
A KIPP Academy spokesperson also told the Boston Globe, ""We condemn harmful comments being made online toward members of our community and will continue to let the vision, mission and principles of our organization guide our actions.""
Barnes had previously given a statement to Fox News Digital about the situation, which had similar verbiage.
""The vision of KIPP Massachusetts is that every child grows up free to create the future they want for themselves and their communities,"" Barnes wrote. ""To do this, we work to create joyful and identity-affirming schools for our students, and prioritize maintaining student and staff safety above everything else.""
TRANS INCLUSION IN WOMEN'S SPORTS BECOMES HOTTER TOPIC IN 2023
""We also support state laws and regulations, which provide students with the right to participate in all school extracurricular activities and sports based on their gender identity or expression,"" Barnes continued.
""We condemn harmful comments being made online toward members of our community, and will continue to let the vision, mission and principles of our organization guide our actions.""
Fox News Digital followed up by asking where KIPP Academy balances safety as a priority if injuries occur in this case, to which no answer was immediately given.
A source told Fox News Digital the transgender student is more than 6 feet tall and has facial hair.
Carol Rose, the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts, also spoke with the Boston Globe, saying the video is ""part of a coordinated attempt nationwide to try to remove LGBTQ people from public life."" She added that ""hundreds, if not thousands"" of trans student-athletes participate in high school sports without issues arising.
Collegiate Charter spokesperson Casey Crane released a statement that indicated the school’s approval of coach Kevin Ortins’ decision to forfeit the game at halftime, especially with the team’s playoff game close on the schedule.
""On February 8th, the coach of the Collegiate Charter School of Lowell Girls’ Basketball Team decided to end a game at halftime after watching a third player injured in the game with KIPP Academy,"" the statement reads.

""The bench was already depleted going into the game with the 12-player roster having four players unable to play. When the coach saw three more go down in the first half leaving him with five players, he made the call to end the game early. The upcoming Charter School playoffs were looming, and he needed a healthy and robust bench in four days.""
However, the statement also alludes to the remaining healthy girls expressing ""concern"" to their coach about continuing to play.
""Once the third was injured, the remaining five expressed concern to him about continuing to play. The players feared getting injured and not being able to compete in the playoffs,"" the statement reads.
LIA THOMAS CHALLENGES WORLD AQUATICS' POLICY ON TRANSGENDER ATHLETES BEFORE OLYMPIC COURT: REPORT
""In an effort to maintain safety for his team, he decided to forfeit. The Charter School supports this decision and reiterates its values of both inclusivity and safety for all students. We take the standards set by the MIAA and our Board of Trustees seriously and strive to uphold them on and off the court. We also follow the guidance from the MIAA and state laws regarding equity and access for all student-athletes,"" it continues.
The Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association (MIAA) handbook states in Section 43.3.1 that ""a student shall not be excluded from participation on a gender-specific sports team that is consistent with the student’s bona fide gender identity.""
Collegiate Charter was aware of this student playing for KIPP Academy, having faced each other on the court earlier this season.
The incident occurred this month in Massachusetts.
Section 43.3.4 of the handbook also says, ""It is a recommended best practice that schools communicate with their opponents as necessary about the gender-specific needs of their team in order to promote inclusion – e.g. to ensure that appropriate locker room facilities are available, that announcer use athlete’s correct pronouns, etc.""

Furthermore, Massachusetts General Laws state ""no person shall be excluded from or discriminated against in admission to a public school of any town, or in obtaining the advantages, privileges, and courses of study of such public school on account of race, color, sex, gender identity, religion, national origin or sexual orientation.""

In a recent edition of ""The Voyage"", a digital series from the Vikings, Cousins detailed the moments following his season-ending injury.
""When I first got hurt, I didn't think I did anything too bad because I get stepped on all the time. … it just felt like my heel got stepped on,"" the 35-year-old quarterback said.

""I assumed at first, 'Oh it's a sprained ankle. This is going to be a difficult next month as I rehab but I'll be able play. I'm a pocket passer,'"" he continued. ""I still didn't think I had torn anything. I still didn't think it'd be season-ending. I just knew it would probably be game-ending.""
""I was in denial,"" he concluded.

At one point, a member of the Vikings training staff instructed Cousins to lean on him so the quarterback could be assisted to the sideline. However, Cousins seemed determined to make it to the bench under his own power, saying, ""I don't want to use you, I just want to hop.""

""I went to go, and my heel got locked into the ground, someone stepped on me and I went, and my heel didn't go,"" Cousins said once he made it to the sideline. ""So it just stressed it like crazy. I didn't feel anything when I went to go. I just pressed down and I got nothing. I just don't have much when I'm pressing.""

Rookie quarterback Jaren Hall was thrust into action after Cousins' injury. As Cousins entered the blue medical tent, he offered some words of encouragement to the young quarterback, saying, ""You got 'em Jaren. They're going to run the football. You got 'em.""
Hall finished the Week 8 game against the Green Bay Packers with 23 passing yards. The Vikings held on to defeat the Packers 24-10.

Cousins ultimately missed the remainder of the season and underwent successful surgery to repair his Achilles tendon. He is scheduled to become a free agent when his contract with Minnesota expires in March.
""I obviously knew what that meant. I'm out for the year. I'm looking at 2024 as the next time I'll step onto a football field,"" Cousins said last November.

Over the past couple of seasons, the Philadelphia Eagles have mastered the rugby-style quarterback sneak that has become known as the ""tush push"" or ""brotherly shove.""
On short-yardage plays, quarterback Jalen Hurts typically lines up under center with two or three players behind him. He takes the snap, the offensive line surges forward and Hurts gets a big push from behind. More often than not, the Eagles gain the yardage needed for a first down.
The Eagles attempted the ""tush push"" 41 times last season. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers were one of the few teams that managed to have success defending the play.

The future of the play has been widely discussed over the past couple seasons, with some pushing for the NFL to ban it.
Troy Vincent, NFL executive vice president of football operations, has consistently spoken out about the outcry against the play, and this week he doubled down on his position.

The Eagles had a success rate of more than 92% when they ran the ""brotherly shove"" last season.
In January, All-Pro center Jason Kelce addressed the Eagles' famous play amid rumors about his potential retirement shortly after the team's disappointing loss to the Buccaneers in the wild-card round.

If he does indeed step away from the NFL, Kelce appears to be more than happy to leave one particular aspect of his football career in the rearview mirror — the infamous ""tush push.""
Kelce plays a key role in the play, but it also requires him to go to the bottom of the pile, which is something he was not fond of.

"March 8, 2024 4:34pm EST",Russell Wilson meets with surprise team ahead of visit with Steelers: report,Fox News,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Soon to be a free agent for the first time in his career, Russell Wilson is making the rounds to find his next destination.
It should surprise nobody that the nine-time Pro Bowler was reportedly slated to visit with the Pittsburgh Steelers on Friday.
Kenny Pickett was replaced by Mason Rudolph late in the season, and all signs point to the Steelers trying to find a quarterback this offseason.

However, before that meeting, Wilson reportedly made a pitstop in New Jersey.
ESPN says Wilson had an ""exploratory meeting"" with the New York Giants on Thursday - he was spotted at the Newark Airport, just miles away from the Giants' facility next to MetLife Stadium.
The Giants are just one year removed from signing Daniel Jones to a four-year, $160 million deal, but after he played in just six games and tore his ACL, there is speculation that the Giants are ""done"" with him. There are also reports flying that the Giants could even trade up to select a quarterback in the draft.
Wilson and the Giants had some sparks a couple of seasons ago, but nothing ever materialized.
Steelers general manager said at the NFL Scouting Combine that he had ""full faith"" in Pickett, a first-round selection in 2022. Rudolph is also a free agent, but the team could bring him back.

NFL STARS KIRK COUSINS, SAQUON BARKLEY, CHRIS JONES EXPECTED TO MAKE A BIG SPLASH IN FREE AGENCY MARKET
Denver acquired Wilson for a haul in 2022: two first-round picks, two second-round picks, a fifth-rounder, Drew Lock, Noah Fant and Shelby Harris. The Broncos inked him to an extension, but, they cut him before the extension even went into effect.
Wilson was set to be the quarterback with new head coach Nathaniel Hackett. However, the Broncos stumbled out of the gate and finished 5-12.
The Broncos hired Sean Payton to replace Hackett after the 2022 season, but Wilson eventually lost his job to Jarrett Stidham despite having a crucial win over the eventual Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs.

Wilson played in 15 games during the 2023 season. He had 3,070 passing yards, 26 touchdown passes and eight interceptions.

Former NFL offensive lineman Chad Wheeler was sentenced to nearly seven years in prison on Friday, just months after he had been found guilty of a vicious attack on his then-girlfriend in 2021.
Wheeler, who was waived by the Seattle Seahawks after being charged with two counts of domestic violence, was sentenced to 81 months in prison and ordered to undergo a mental health evaluation, The Seattle Times reported.

Cam Newton delved further into the altercation he had during a 7-on-7 football tournament in Atlanta last month, where video caught him fighting with coaches he formerly worked with on his ""C1N"" squad.
Newton joined Shaquille O’Neal and Adam Lefkoe on ""The Big Podcast with Shaq,"" where he said things could have escalated to the point where handcuffs might have been on his wrists.
""Somebody is going to say something triggering to you, and it just takes one time,"" Newton said. ""I could be in jail, somebody could file a lawsuit.""

No one was arrested during the incident at the ""We Ball Sports"" inaugural 7-on-7 tournament, where coaches TJ and Steph Brown were seen fighting with Newton at the top of the steps near the football field.
O’Neal initially brought up how he had noticed videos where kids are talking trash to Newton, and did not understand why that happened.
""It’s the access,"" Newton said before getting into the altercation that occurred. ""Just to give you context: Anybody who knows me, know I’m a product of my environment. Born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia. What you saw, those were grown men. Those weren’t kids. So that narrative [is] familiar coaching and it got chippy.
""For me, that’s not the first time that happens. And honestly knowing my world, that probably won’t be the last. I think looking back at it, [it’s like], ‘Yeah, Cam standing on business. Yeah, Cam had bobby pins in his hair.’ Those are all funny things, but when I look at it, it’s like, ‘Man, it could’ve gotten ugly on both sides.’ I’m the type of person, when I feel triggered, I react. It’s not, ‘Cmon Shaq, let’s go get ‘em.’ I’m not that person. You say something to me, and I go. I don’t think. And that’s the issue.
CAM NEWTON EXPRESSES REMORSE FOR ROLE IN SCUFFLE AT FOOTBALL TOURNAMENT: ‘I APOLOGIZE TO ANYBODY AFFECTED’
""That’s where my whole support was kinda caught off guard. We were talking, something was said, and then it was like, ‘Aye, aye, where you going?’ I’m going to use the restroom. But that’s just how I rock and roll.""
Newton previously addressed the situation on his ""4th and 1"" podcast this past Friday, expressing his remorse for what went down.
""I’m disappointed in myself for letting it escalate to what it did and that’s what I’m apologetic to,"" he said. ""The truth of the matter is this: Me, being in my position, I should’ve never put myself in that position. That’s just the truth. That could’ve got ugly, for real.""
Newton did acknowledge that trash talk from the game he played against Brown’s TopShelf Performance (TSP) team carried over from the field.
""There was a lot of talking on both sides – on all side, let’s just put it like that,"" he explained. ""I don’t want to point the finger and say this person said that or that person said that. Am I saying this is the first time it happened or the last time it happened? It’s something that starts with words and should’ve ended with words.""

TJ and Steph Brown both spoke with Fox News Digital the day after the fight occurred to share their side of the story, when they felt tension immediately the day before when the two teams faced each other. Videos from warmups showed both teams trash talking, including Newton, as both sides showcased their rivalry with one another.
TSP would end up winning the game, and TJ Brown said Newton confronted him the next day in the parking lot before the Sunday slate of games.
""Sunday comes, I’m walking through the parking lot, walking to the field,"" he recounted. ""Cam jumps out of his car and yells, ‘Hey, all that sorry s--- ain’t gonna work today. What we betting today? What we betting?’ I’m like, ‘I ain’t betting you, bro. I already beat you three, four times. You got to beat me first.’ He like, ‘What we betting? I got plenty of money. I ain’t ever running out of money.’ That’s when I told him, ‘That’s your problem. All you care about is money. You think money is everything. You can’t buy me.’ And I walk off.""
TJ Brown added that Newton was hurling jabs at TSP during their game from the top steps.
COACHES INVOLVED IN CAM NEWTON FIGHT REVEAL WHAT LED TO ALTERCATION WITH NFL QB: ‘TYPICAL CAM’
""It’s probably three minutes into the game, he’s sitting up top with all his kids around him under a tent yelling down on us,"" TJ said. ""‘Hey, I know that play. That’s my stuff. I taught y’all everything y’all know. I’m y’all daddy. I made y’all. I’m the reason for everything y’all got going on.’ He’s just yelling all this stuff.""
One anonymous parent who was present for the altercation on Sunday confirmed to Fox News Digital that Newton had been taunting those on the field.

Steph Brown went to confront Newton after the game, which escalated things even more. The way TJ remembered it, he was walking up the steps where Steph Brown and Newton were already standing atop, and video shows Newton grabbing Steph Brown by his jacket after they were face-to-face trading words.
TJ jumped in, throwing a punch at Newton before the latter grabbed him, and the fight moved toward a fence.
""If you’re walking up a flight of stairs, and you see a 6’6"" guy grab your little brother trying to throw him down some stairs, you’re going to intervene,"" TJ said. ""It doesn’t matter who you are, rather it be a punch, rather it be a push, rather it be grabbing him. You’re going to do something. So, at that point, with Cam putting his hands on another grown man, something is going to come behind that.
""This is typical Cam Newton behavior on the 7-on-7 scene,"" TJ added. ""But yesterday was a little worse, and you can even ask people in his organization. Cam ain’t never act like that. I’ve seen him talk crazy to parents, talk crazy to some of the kids because everybody tries to make it seem like, ‘Oh, the kids just be disrespecting Cam.’ No, Cam be disrespecting people, too.""

Missouri Gov. Mike Parson’s decision to commute ex-Kansas City Chiefs assistant Britt Reid’s sentence has the attorney of a young girl injured in the drunken car wreck fuming.
Reid, the son of Chiefs head coach Andy Reid, pleaded guilty to driving while intoxicated in 2022 after driving his Dodge truck about 84 mph in a 65 mph zone into two cars on an entrance ramp to Interstate 435 near Arrowhead Stadium Feb. 4, 2021.
Among the injured was 5-year-old Ariel Young, who fell into an 11-day coma and continues to deal with life-changing injuries due to the accident. A girl who was 4 years old at the time was among four others seriously injured.

Reid received a three-year prison sentence after accepting a plea deal on initial charges that carried a maximum penalty of seven years in prison. However, Parson reduced Reid’s prison sentence, and he’ll serve the remainder of his three years on house arrest, which will end Oct. 31.
He will also be required to attend weekly meetings with a parole officer and peer support sponsor, while participating in behavioral counseling among other conditions.
Tom Porto, an attorney for Ariel and her family, told Yahoo Sports why he believes Gov. Parson, who hasn’t addressed the media about his decision, commuted Reid’s sentence.
MISSOURI GOVERNOR REDUCES SENTENCE OF EX-CHIEFS COACH BRITT REID; REMAINING SENTENCE CHANGED TO HOUSE ARREST
""It’s because the governor of Missouri is a Chiefs fan, went to the Super Bowl, went to the after-parties, went to the parade and the rally and even has a Chiefs tattoo,"" he said.
Young’s mother, Felicia Miller, also released a statement after learning of Reid’s commuted sentence.
""It seems the laws don’t apply equally to the haves and have-nots,"" it said. ""The haves get favors. The have-nots serve their sentence.""

""Ariel is dealing with the effects of her injuries to this day, and there is an understanding of the lifelong deficits she is facing,"" Porto added.
Parson’s office released a statement regarding the commutation, saying, ""Reid has completed his alcohol abuse treatment program and has served more prison time than most individuals convicted of similar offenses.""
Reid’s blood alcohol level was at 0.113% two hours after the crash, police said. The legal limit is 0.08%.
The Chiefs reached a confidential agreement with Ariel’s family to pay for her ongoing medical treatment.

Russell Wilson’s expected release from the Denver Broncos brings a disastrous end to what some are calling one of the worst contracts in NFL history.
As the team looks ahead to replacing Wilson, which is expected to be made official when the new league year begins on March 13, one Broncos legend didn’t hold back his thoughts on the situation.
Linebacker Karl Mecklenberg, a six-time Pro Bowler and three-time All-Pro who racked up all 1,118 combined tackles in a Broncos uniform during his 12 NFL seasons, sounded off on Wilson in a social media post.

""Russell Wilson isn’t a leader,"" he tweeted. ""The foolishness that went on in his first year at Denver with a private coach, his own office at the facility, and family at training camp when other players didn’t have those privileges, proved his self centeredness.""
Mecklenberg is one of many who believe Wilson's time in Denver was a major disappointment. He lasted just two seasons with the organization after signing a massive $242-plus million contract over five years following the blockbuster trade with the Seattle Seahawks.
However, the marriage didn't last long as Mecklenberg pointed out the reports coming out of Denver in his first year, and things got even worse when Sean Payton joined as head coach in 2023.
BRONCOS TO RELEASE RUSSELL WILSON AFTER 2 SEASONS
""We spoke with Russell Wilson today to inform him of his release after the start of the league year,"" general manager George Paton and head coach Sean Payton said in a joint statement. ""On behalf of the Broncos, we thank Russell for his contributions and dedication to our team and community while wishing him the best as he continues his career.""
""As we move forward, we are focused on building the strongest team possible for the 2024 season and beyond. We are excited to improve this offseason and will have the flexibility to get better through the draft and free agency.""
Wilson would lose his starting role in 2023 to Jarrett Stidham despite having a crucial win over the eventual Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs to keep the Broncos in playoff contention.
It was a situation that involved Wilson's lucrative contract, where the Broncos wanted amended language and the Super Bowl-winning quarterback didn't oblige.

He played 30 regular-season games in a Denver uniform, going 11-19 during that span including a 7-8 record last year.
Wilson, who still wants to win Super Bowls, said in a recent episode of the ""I AM ATHLETE"" podcast that he wanted to stay with the Broncos.
""I've got more fire than ever, honestly, especially over the past two years and what I've gone through,"" the 35-year-old Super Bowl champion said. ""Whether it's in Denver or somewhere else. I hope it's in Denver. I hope I get to finish there. I committed there. I want to be there.""
But the free agent pool will get Wilson instead, as he looks to find his next team in the NFL at 35 years old.

"February 25, 2024 5:03pm EST",NBA suspends 5 players involved in Heat-Pelicans skirmish,Fox News,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
The NBA on Sunday suspended five players involved in the skirmish during Friday night’s game between the New Orleans Pelicans and Miami Heat.
Heat center Thomas Bryant and Pelicans guard Jose Alvarado were suspended for three games for fighting and leaving the bench area. Heat guards Jimmy Butler and Nikola Jovic along with Pelicans forward Naji Marshall were each given a one-game suspension.

Butler will lose $260,000 in base salary because of his suspension. The rest of the suspensions will cost the four other players about $115,000 combined.
The scrap occurred late in the fourth quarter after a hard foul on Zion Williamson as the big man went up for a layup. Kevin Love tried his best to thwart Williamson.
Williamson hit the floor hard, and a couple of his teammates rushed over to make sure he was OK, with one pushing Love out of the way. Butler returned with a push of his own, and that's when he and Marshall came face to face. When they were jawing at one another, Marshall put his right hand around Butler's throat, and they had to be separated by members of both teams.

Another view of the aftermath appeared to show Thomas Bryant, who was not checked into the game yet, throwing a punch at Jose Alvarado, causing yet another brouhaha near the scorer's table.
During that, a fan could be seen throwing an object in the direction of the players.
Butler said he didn’t think he should’ve been ejected.
""I put my hand around his neck. He put his hand around my neck,"" he said of the incident with Marshall. ""And it just took off the way it did.""

"March 4, 2024 5:56pm EST",University president delivers strong statement against biological males in women’s sports: ‘Enough is enough',Fox News,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
After seeing his student-athletes lose to a biological male during a sporting event this past weekend, Dr. Wayne D. Lewis Jr., president of Houghton University, issued a strong statement against biological males participating in women's sports.
The statement, titled ""In Defense of Women's Athletics,"" is a lengthy call to action from Lewis, the sixth president of the private Christian university in upstate New York.
""Biological males’ participation in women’s athletics is wrong,"" wrote Lewis, the first African-American president of the university. ""Most Americans and most of the world know it to be wrong. A fringe agenda under the guise of making school and collegiate athletics more inclusive for transgender people has grown to the place of now unfairly displacing gifted and hardworking female athletes, obliterating the historic achievements and records of female athletes of the past, and threatening to dismantle the opportunities and protections for girls and women in sport trailblazing leaders fought so hard to create and protect.""
""Too many leaders, parents, professional athletes, and people of goodwill have been silent as female athletes are humiliated, silenced, and robbed of hard-earned opportunities. That silence is complicit with the fringe agenda that threatens to dismantle girls’ and women’s athletics.""

Lewis’s statement comes after the All-Atlantic Regional Championships in track and field, where transgender athlete Sadie Schreiner of Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) won the women’s 200-meter dash.
""I currently serve a Christian university as its president,"" he wrote. ""I believe God has formed each of us, men and women, with intention and purpose. I further believe sex and gender are a divine prerogative and are neither separate from each other nor subject to change. However, my assertion that biological males’ participation in women’s athletics is wrong is not a Christian position. It is a moral position.""
""While I currently serve a Christian university, most of my career has been in the public sector as a teacher, professor, administrator, and state education chief. If I served in any of those roles again, my position would be the same,"" he continued.
Lewis previously explained his stance on WHAM 1180, saying the same during an interview that it is a ""moral position.""
RILEY GAINES CALLS SUSPENSION OF COLLEGE'S INVESTIGATION INTO HER HOSTAGE ASSAULT ‘AN ABOMINATION’
""When I see young women with ‘Houghton’ written across their uniform … at a competitive disadvantage, sometimes losing opportunities that are hard-earned, there is no way that I, as their president, will continue to sit on the sidelines and refuse to advocate for change,"" he said.
""Throughout human history and to the present, most of the world and most Americans have upheld the truth that men and women have important distinguishing characteristics,"" Lewis continued in his statement. ""American society is organized based on that understanding. Our organization of sport exists based on that understanding. Stating the obvious and widely supported truth that men and women have important biological differences is not a position of hatred or bigotry. It is common sense.""
""While I believe most policy attempts to be inclusive of persons who identify as transgender are likely well-meaning, I struggle to understand how leaders with the best interest of girls and women at heart could advocate for or endorse practices that not only place female athletes at a competitive disadvantage, but also subject them to disrespect and embarrassment and place them at greater risk for harassment and assault.""
To conclude his statement, Lewis looked for support in his stance.
""Enough is enough,"" he said. ""I will not sit by silently as a university president whose female student-athletes step weekly onto tracks, courts, and fields to compete but, in some cases, are forced to do so on playing fields we know to be unfair. I hope you will join me.""
Schreiner, who reportedly goes by the name ""Sadie Rose,"" broke two women’s track and field records at RIT, setting the 200-meter record with a 25.27-second time in January. Schreiner also broke the 300-meter record with a 40.78-second finish, per the National Desk.

The Liberty League, the Division III conference in which RIT participates, honored Schreiner as its Women’s Track and Field Performer of the Week in January.
The Independent Council on Women’s Sports sent a letter to the Liberty League in February, expressing their concern about Schreiner’s participation in women’s track and field.
""The only way sport can be fair and equal for women is with a protected female category that excludes competitors with male advantage,"" the letter reads.
TRANS INCLUSION IN WOMEN'S SPORTS BECOMES HOTTER TOPIC IN 2023
To back its argument, the letter cited World Athletics, the governing body of track and field, and its handbook, specifically Rule C3.5, which is ""Eligibility Regulations for Transgender Athletes.""
""World Athletics wants to give equal opportunities to all athletes to participate in and excel at the sport, and to provide them with fair and meaningful competition conditions, so that they are motivated to make the huge commitment and sacrifice required to excel in the sport, and so inspire new generations to join the sport and aspire to the same excellence,"" the rule states.
""The substantial sex difference in sports performance that emerges from puberty onwards means that the only way to achieve the objectives set out above is to maintain separate classifications (competition categories) for male and female athletes. That difference is due to the physical advantages conferred on male athletes by the testes producing much higher levels of circulating testosterone than ovaries produce from puberty onwards in female athletes.""

The NCAA’s current regulations on transgender student-athletes participating in sports at the collegiate level are a by-sport basis, meaning each governing body of that sport will determine if participation is allowed.
RIT did not immediately respond to a request for comment when asked by Fox News Digital.

"March 11, 2024 8:51pm EDT",Austin Ekeler agrees to 2-year deal with Commanders: reports,Fox News,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Another running back is off the free agent board, as former Los Angeles Charger Austin Ekeler is joining the Washington Commanders on a two-year deal, according to multiple reports.
Ekeler will play on a deal up to $11 million, ESPN reported, after completing his four-year deal that was worth $24.1 million with the Chargers last season.
Ekeler, 28, did not see eye to eye with the Chargers this past offseason, when he requested a trade after not being able to reach a long-term extension with the team. When a trade never went through, Ekeler agreed to an incentivized revision of his final year on the contract.

He went on to have one of the worst seasons of his career with the Chargers in 2023, averaging just 3.5 yards per carry (628 total yards on 179 attempts) and scoring just five times after 13 and 12 touchdowns in 2022 and 2021 respectively.
Ekeler is also known to be a receiving threat, making 107 receptions in 2022. However, he had just 51 for 436 yards last season over 14 games.
JOSH JACOBS, PACKERS AGREE TO DEAL AFTER STANDOUT TENURE WITH RAIDERS: REPORT
But the Commanders are likely hoping Ekeler can get back to form next season under his former Chargers head coach, Anthony Lynn, who joined Dan Quinn’s new coaching staff in Washington as running backs coach.
Ekeler will be joining a backfield that also features Brian Robinson, who had 733 yards on 178 carries last season in his second year in the NFL.

How the Commanders and new offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury will be delegating their touches will be interesting to see unfold. Given Ekeler’s versatility, Kingsbury will be able to use him anywhere, no matter the down.
The 2021 season was Ekeler’s best year with 1,558 scrimmage yards and 20 total touchdowns for the Chargers in 16 games. He followed it up with 1,637 scrimmage yards and 18 total touchdowns.
Last offseason, running backs market was slow, but several agreed to terms with teams on Monday, most notably the Philadelphia Eagles landing Saquon Barkley and Josh Jacobs moving to the Green Bay Packers.

Sunday marks the end of an era not just in Iowa, but in women's basketball.
Caitlin Clark will be playing her final home game for the Iowa Hawkeyes, as the superstar has declared for the WNBA Draft.
The Hawkeyes will start the Big Ten Tournament later this week before playing in the women's March Madness tournament – then, it's off to the pros for Clark.
But Sunday has a lot more meaning than just a farewell, as Clark will likely find herself rewriting the history books.

Before we get to Clark, this is an important game for the Hawkeyes, who are ranked sixth in the country. Iowa (25-4, 14-3) is hosting No. 2 Ohio State (25-3, 16-1), who have clinched the regular season conference title. The Buckeyes have won 15 straight.
It's the best test Iowa can get, as they fight to send Clark to the pros with a long-coveted NCAA championship.
Clark, though, will be going for history.

DAVIDSON WOMEN’S BASKETBALL CANCELS HISTORIC SEASON WITH JUST ONE GAME REMAINING, DUE TO OVERWHELMING INJURIES
Clark became the NCAA women's all-time leading scorer on Feb. 15, but she is now 18 points away from scoring the most points in men's or women's college history.
""Pistol"" Pete Maravich scored 3,667 in his three seasons at LSU (without a three-point line). Clark currently sits at 3,650.
She's averaging 32.2 points per game this season, so the record should come on Sunday – Clark has not scored under 18 points in a game since Feb. 12 of last year. In fact, in her 129 career games at Iowa, she's scored under 18 in just five of them.

""It honestly does not matter what your handicap is. The fastest and quickest way to get better at golf is to work on your short game,"" she said in a video posted on X. ""You need to be absolutely dialed 100 yards and in. Work on your chipping, work on your wedge game, work on your sand shots and especially on your putting.
""Most people don’t realize how long pros actually work on their short game. I’m talking hours and hours and hours dedicated, and I know we can’t do that. We don’t have the time or the patience honestly. But dedicating at least 25 minutes in your practice schedule to short game will be life-changing.""
Spiranac also weighed in on why having a solid short game is good for the long haul.

"March 12, 2024 4:30am EDT",US track star Noah Lyles says representing country at Olympics is ‘bittersweet’,Fox News,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Not only is Noah Lyles the face of track and field in the United States, he just might be the face of the sport around the globe.
The 26-year-old is fresh off three gold medals in the World Championships last year in Budapest, and now he is gearing up for the 2024 Olympics in Paris.
Lyles is the heavy favorite to win the 200-meter, and he's a candidate to break Usain Bolt's world record of 19.19. He's set to compete in four events: the 100-, 200-, 4x100- and 4x400-meter races.
The U.S. has dominated the latter since the inception of the Olympics. They've won 18 of the 25 golds in the event, including eight of the last 10. However, no American has won the 100- or 200-meter since 2004, and the U.S. hasn't won the 4x100 relay since 2000. So, all eyes will be on Lyles, as he represents the red, white and blue.

However, Lyles says representing the country is ""contradicting.""
""It’s a bittersweet moment. I’m American, and I truly believe that we are the best in the world, especially when it comes to sports. We have definitely been proving that dominance. … And it feels good to add on to that collection that the U.S. is the best,"" Lyles said in a recent interview with Fox News Digital.
""But at the same time, it’s with a heavy heart, because being Black in America, there’s a lot to deal with. I’m not going to go into everything, but it’s not easy. It’s hard to love the country that sometimes doesn’t love you back.
""At the same time, you always want to put your best foot forward. So, it’s a little contradicting, it's with a heavy heart, but it still makes you feel extremely proud because you are an American.""

Lyles admitted he's thought about not participating in the sport because of his experiences, but ""I feel I can do more good by staying in the sport and still fighting that fight and explaining my message through being in the sport.""
But as previously mentioned, the country is counting on Lyles to win golds and put the country on his back. That could certainly be a high-pressure situation for Lyles, but it's not.
That's because he wants to be the face of the sport.

""I feel that a lot of who I am has been a brand in pushing the sport and pushing the needle,"" he said. ""Which is something I’ve always worked towards. That’s why I have media days where I take interviews that are outside of track and field, why I take on most questions and not answer with ‘no comment.’""
""I want to be able to give my voice and my thoughts and see people look at the sport and be like, ‘Wow, I like that guy, I want to see more of him, I want to watch more of this sport.’ I don’t feel pressure from it because this is what I’ve asked for.""

Graham said his decision to stay in Philly was partly inspired by Ray Lewis, who spent his entire 17-year career with the Baltimore Ravens.
""I did it because I always wanted to get to 15 (years in the NFL),"" Graham told CBS Sports. ""I'm happy that the team wanted me one more year. … It's important to me because Ray Lewis was one of the guys I looked up to (as a player); to see him do it the way he did it (staying with one team for 17 seasons) was nice … but I'm done after this.""

Saturday was slated to be Serrano's 50th professional fight, and perhaps even a farewell. The event was at Puerto Rico's famed Coliseo, an 18,500-person arena, and Serrano said she ""will retire"" at the venue.
Jake Paul, the co-founder of MVP, explained that Serrano's cornea had been damaged from the chemical, which also burnt her hand, and there was too much risk in allowing her to fight.

JAKE PAUL EARNS SECOND-STRAIGHT FIRST-ROUND VICTORY, CALLS OUT CANELO ALVAREZ: 'I'M THE FACE OF THIS SPORT'
Paul, who is normally the main event wherever he fights, took a backseat this time, telling Fox News Digital earlier this week that it was Serrano's ""time to shine.""
""I just always wanted that for her. This is her moment, and her time to shine,"" Paul said to Fox News Digital before Saturday's fight. ""It’s just so cool to support her. She really deserves this moment and has worked so hard for it. I’m happy to be a fan. The pressure is off of you when you’re not the main event, but you hear the crowd is much louder for her out there. So that’s why this is her spot, her time to shine.""
Serrano spoke with Fox News Digital last month and gave Paul the utmost thanks for allowing her to the main-event in her home country.
""He said this is my home, and he would never take that main event,"" Serrano said at the time. ""I'm like, ‘No you can do it! You can do it!’ He's like, 'There is no way you’re going home, and you're going to showcase your home.'""

"March 7, 2024 3:04pm EST",New Jersey school district exploring legal action after controversial basketball game decision: report,Fox News,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Legal action is being explored by the school district that didn’t win its appeal of a decision made by officials in a controversial New Jersey high school boys basketball game, per the Asbury Park Press.
Manasquan school district Superintendent Dr. Frank Kasyan says he’s hoping to get an injunction to stop games moving forward after Manasquan High School’s buzzer-beater against Camden High School was waved off by officials on Tuesday night.
The New Jersey Interscholastic Athletic Association made a statement on Wednesday admitting officials got the call wrong after further review. However, Manasquan’s appeal was denied as rules state the game is in the books.

""I don’t know what can happen, that is why I turned it over to Michael Gross, our school board attorney,"" Kasyan told the Asbury Park Press. ""I would like to see him get an injunction from the court to stop the games until our protest is heard, because a lot of time what happens is you’ll protest, it drags on, and then it becomes a moot point. So the game is Saturday. This has to happen quickly, and he’s on it.
""I just want to see a just and ethical decision being made by the NJSIAA, and that is what those officials are there for. This is something different. There is physical evidence that shows the game wasn’t over, and the ball went through, so there you have it.""
The play in question revolves around what happened after Camden’s Alijah Curry hit a free throw that put his team up one point with 5.8 seconds left. Manasquan needed to go the length of the floor to score a game-winner to move on to the state final.
NEW JERSEY HS BOYS BASKETBALL PLAYOFF GAME ENDS IN CONTROVERSY OVER BUZZER-BEATER: ‘THEY SCREWED THESE KIDS’
Rey Weinseimer of Manasquan heaved a three-pointer, which was heavily contested, and it hit off the right side of the rim. But his teammate Griffin Linstra appeared to tip the ball back off the glass and into the hoop before the buzzer sounded.
Manasquan fans stormed the court in celebration, but after referees conferred, the basket was called off, giving Camden the victory.
While the NJSIAA has yet to comment on Kasyan’s remarks, it did release a lengthy statement explaining why it wasn’t going to overturn the result of the game despite the video evidence.
""Here, all of the events happened within the final second of the game. One of the three officials counted the basket as beating the buzzer. The three officials then met at half-court to confer. A second official saw the ball in the shooter’s hands when the buzzer sounded. The officials then waived off the basket. Later, after being shown video clips, the second official agreed the basket should have counted.

""That said, the rules are clear – once game officials leave the ‘visual confines of the playing court,’ the game is concluded, and the score is official. So, while the officiating crews’ reports indicate that a post-game review of footage of the play in question convinced them that the basket should have counted, the results could not then and cannot now be changed.""
The NJSIAA also pointed to its regulations, including ""no video or audio recording may be used to review of challenge the decision of a sports official."" Instant replay is not used in New Jersey high school games.
Manasquan school district released a statement after reading what the NJSIAA had to say.
""We appreciate the NJSIAA’s transparency in admitting the error in the calling of last night’s Group 2 Semifinal Boys Basketball game and appreciate their apology,"" it read. ""It is indeed ‘frustrating,’ however, that the NJSIAA refuses to exercise its discretion to remedy a situation that was so obvious and well documented.
""In our unwavering support of our players, coaches and families, the District will continue to pursue any available appeals we can to vindicate the values of fair play and integrity that should be the hallmarks of interscholastic athletics.""
While the NJSIAA says that games may not be reversed after officials leave the playing grounds, The Asbury Park Press pointed to moments like last year’s baseball tournament, where Ridge was disqualified by the NJSIAA two days after a pitch-count violation occurred in a win over Westfield.

Legendary college basketball broadcaster Dick Vitale has thrown his support behind Iowa star Caitlin Clark after ESPN analyst Jay Williams recently doubled down on his controversial take that Clark can’t be considered among the ""greatest"" without a national championship.
The debate surrounding Clark’s status in women’s college basketball took a turn when Williams said earlier this month that he would not yet consider her one of the all-time greats because she has yet to claim a title.

""I think the way she plays, the pizzazz, is, she's probably the most prolific scorer the game of basketball has ever seen,"" he said on Feb. 17, via USA Today.  ""I am unwilling... to say that she is great yet.""

His comments came just days after Clark became the NCAA women’s scoring leader.
Last week, Williams doubled down on his take during Wednesday’s broadcast of the LSU-Kentucky game.
""We were talking about ‘greatest,’ and in my interview we talked about GOATs,"" Williams said. ""For me, I’m like, you wanna be a GOAT? Fine. There’s levels of greatness. You gotta win championships to be GOATs.

""So when people want to don her as the greatest of (all time), I’m like, ‘Let’s slow down.’ I’ve seen Diana Taurasi. I’ve seen Breanna Stewart. And you can sit there and tell me all day long, ‘Well, she’s played with other great players.’ OK, great. Championships — that’s how we measure greatness overall.""
But some disagree with that notion – including one of college basketball’s most iconic voices.

Rudy Gobert seemed to insinuate the Minnesota Timberwolves were at a disadvantage Friday night.
With less than 30 seconds left in the fourth quarter, the T-Wolves led the Cleveland Cavaliers, 97-96, and Minnesota had the ball.
Gobert, though, was called for a foul, his sixth of the night, leading to his early exit. But he wasn't a fan of the call and let referee Scott Foster know about it.

While walking off the court, Gobert rubbed his fingers together, seemingly suggesting refs had money on the game.
That prompted a technical foul, giving the Cavs a free throw. Darius Garland knocked it, the game went into overtime and Cleveland won, 113-104.
""A technical foul with 27 seconds in the game, to be honest, is unacceptable,"" Wolves assistant head coach Micah Nori, filling in for an ill Chris Finch, said. ""That’s who Rudy is, but you’ve got to be smart. He made a visual that was automatic. He was obviously frustrated — both teams were — but we have to be smarter.""

""I think just reflecting back over my four years, I’m just very grateful,"" Clark said to the crowd when asked what her journey has been like to this point.

Clark loved that the Hawkeyes ""came out and dominated"" on Senior Day against a Buckeyes team that’s ranked No. 2 in the country and beat No. 6 Iowa earlier this season.

Clark said she was ""soaking it all in"" during her last regular season game at home. However, thanks to top teams in the NCAA Tournament hosting games, there could be a maximum of two more games at home this month.
""It’ll be a little less bitter,"" Clark said. ""… Probably won’t hit me for a little bit more later.""
While the ceremony was a nice way to honor these Hawkeyes, a group led by Clark who changed college basketball not just in Iowa City but across the country, they know the job isn’t finished.

""I'm just kind of ready for the next chapter and a new challenge in my life. But I think the reason I decided to announce it when I did was just to have that closure, especially going into Senior Night.""
Closure came at the perfect time for Clark, who scored 35 points during the March 3 game against Ohio State and passed Pete Maravich as the all-time scoring leader. The game itself broke records, attracting more than 4 million television viewers at its peak and becoming the most-watched women's regular-season basketball game since 1999.

Warriors coach Steve Kerr and Hornets coach Steve Clifford were shaking hands as the incident ensued. Both coaches turned around after the whistle was blown. NBC Sports Bay Area cameras caught Clifford mouthing, ""What the f---.""
There was about a one-second difference between the shot clock and the game clock. The Hornets appeared to take issue with the supposed unwritten rules of basketball.

""I don’t really understand why people get so mad at somebody scoring at the end of the game. It’s like this dumb, unofficial, unwritten rule,"" Warriors forward Draymond Green said. ""If you all were winning by 13 points, would you get mad if he laid a ball up? I doubt it. So it's kind of like a sore loser type thing.""
Clifford downplayed the skirmish itself.

""I don’t think it was anything major. Maybe a little shove here and there,"" he said. ""There’s frustration, whatever, it’s going to happen.""
Quinones was in his 21st game of the season and only the 25th of his career. He’s averaged about 12.8 minutes per game this season and 4.9 points per game.
Kerr said he has taught his team to keep playing through the end of the game unless the shot clock is turned off.
""For ten years, I’ve told our team, ‘If there’s a shot-clock differential, you keep playing,’"" Kerr said, via NBC Sports Bay Area. ""To me, the game tells you to keep playing. We’ve always done it that way. Nobody’s ever been offended.

""To me it’s very strange why that would be offensive to anybody. I’ve never understood why that would be offensive. Nobody’s ever been upset with us in the past for doing that. Why take a turnover? The clock says keep playing, you keep playing. That shouldn’t offend anybody.""

"February 23, 2024 3:47pm EST",Ex-NFL player says he was sexually assaulted by his high school athletic trainer,Fox News,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
A dozen people have filed a lawsuit against a former high school trainer in southern California.
One of those 12 plaintiffs is former NFL cornerback Shareece Wright.
Wright came out of anonymity this week when he told ESPN's ""Outside the Lines"" that he was indeed one of the 12 people who were suing the Colton Joint Unified School District and Colton High School's former athletic trainer, Tiffany Strauss-Gordon.

""The less it's kept a secret, the harder it is for it to continue to happen,"" Wright said.
Wright said he met the trainer in 2002 when he was 15, and she was 21. Wright said Strauss-Gordon would flirt with him and call him a pet nickname.
Wright said over the course of the next three years, before he turned 18 - the age of consent in California - they had multiple sexual encounters in the training room, locker room and weight room. He also says they had sex at her father's house, who was the head football coach at the time.

ADRIAN PETERSON THREATENS LEGAL ACTION AFTER HIS MEMORABILIA WAS ALLEGEDLY SOLD WITHOUT HIS PERMISSION
""You've got football, you've got the coach's daughter, you've got a permissive school environment where it's allowed to happen. I mean, you've got sort of a perfect storm of sexual abuse that could be covered up easily,"" attorney Morgan Stewart, who represents Wright and eight other plaintiffs, told ESPN.
Strauss-Gordon has been suspended by the district since 2022. The suit was filed that September, but ESPN says school officials knew of allegations as far back as 2011.
Wright was selected by the then-San Diego Chargers in the third round of the 2011 NFL Draft, one of three Colton players drafted that year.

"March 6, 2024 9:43am EST","Who is Kylie Kelce, Jason Kelce’s wife?",Fox News,"NFL star Jason Kelce delighted fans at Highmark Stadium in Orchard Park, N.Y., Jan. 21, during the Chiefs-Bills AFC divisional playoff game.
From an epic Super Bowl matchup in 2023, to an emotional retirement and romantic love stories, the Kelce brothers continue to maintain their place in the spotlight.
Jason Kelce, center for the Philadelphia Eagles, announced his NFL retirement this week and paid tribute to his adoring wife, Kylie, in the meantime.
The personal lives of the Kelce brothers have been on full display, especially since Jason's brother, Travis, kicked off his relationship with A-list singer and songwriter, Taylor Swift.

A TIMELINE OF TAYLOR SWIFT AND TRAVIS KELCE'S BUDDING ROMANCE
Between Jason being named one of People's Sexiest Men Alive in 2023 and Travis' high-profile relationship making headlines on a regular basis, fans have taken a newfound interest in Kylie, too.
Read on to learn more about Kylie, about her relationship with Jason and how she supported him throughout his NFL career.
Kylie was born and raised in Philadelphia.
After high school, she continued her education at Cabrini University in Pennsylvania, where she played field hockey and studied communications.
Her husband was born in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, but made his way to Philadelphia due to his successful NFL career with the Eagles.
Jason and Kylie's relationship started as many modern relationships do — with a swipe.
The pair met on Tinder in 2014. The two, though quite private, have indulged in how they met with fans on both the ""New Heights"" podcast hosted by the Kelce brothers, and the Amazon Prime documentary ""Kelce.""
""Well, his profile at the time was something to the effect of, 'I want to have deep meaningful conversations and talk about getting married and having kids' or something like that,"" Kylie said of her husband's Tinder profile on the podcast.
Upon matching with Jason, Kylie said she had no idea of his NFL status he featured no photos of his NFL life on Tinder.

Their first date wasn't exactly a romantic affair either, according to Kylie.
""You fell asleep 45 minutes after I got there on the bar table because he was too drunk,"" she said on the podcast.
Nonetheless, the spark was there, because that date marked the first of many in their relationship.
TRAVIS KELCE FIGHTS BACK TEARS DURING JASON KELCE'S EMOTIONAL RETIREMENT SPEECH
After a few years of dating, the couple tied the knot at the Logan Hotel in Philadelphia on April 14, 2018. Their dog, Winnie, was also present at the ceremony. Over 150 guests were present to watch the couple wed.
In April last year, Kylie shared a photo from their wedding day to her Instagram. The caption reads, ""4.14.18-Five years ago feels like yesterday. I love you, J.""
Jason and Kylie are parents to three daughters.
Their first child, Wyatt Elizabeth Kelce, was born in October 2019. Elliotte Ray followed in March 2021.
In February 2023, Jason and Kylie welcomed a third daughter, Bennett Llewellyn, into the family.

The Kelce brothers faced off against each other in the 2023 Super Bowl. And even though Kylie was at the tail end of her pregnancy during the game, she was still in attendance. She attended the game accompanied by her OB-GYN – just in case.
During Jason's emotional NFL retirement speech, he talked about his, obviously loving, relationship with Kylie.
""I still remember the moment she walked through the door,"" Jason said of the day he met his wife. ""The first instance is burned in my retina. It was like she glided through the opening, an aura around her.
""She was beautiful, smart, serious, yet playful. I knew it right away.""

""I think it’s no coincidence I have enjoyed my best years of my career with Kylie by my side,"" he added. ""Every accolade I have ever received has come with her in my life.
""She has brought the best out of me through love, devotion, support, honesty, intelligence and, of course, a swift kick in the a-- from time to time,"" Jason said. ""She has also given me three beautiful girls and a life that increasingly brings me more fulfillment off the field than it does on. We've had a great run, Ky.""

Many wondered when Eric Bieniemy would take the next step from offensive coordinator to head coach in the NFL.
Things didn't look promising when he was not retained by new Washington Commanders head coach Dan Quinn, but not many could have predicted this.
In a shocking move, he is reportedly headed back to UCLA, where he coached two decades ago.

""This is a great opportunity for me to help support DeShaun [Foster] as a new head coach, to work with him and for him as well,"" Bieniemy told CBS Sports.
""It is an opportunity for my family and I to return back to a place we once called home. This is a great opportunity for me to utilize all of my experience working with future Hall of Fame players and a Hall of Fame head coach [Andy Reid] to help teach and inspire young men what it takes to be successful on and off the field.""
ESPN says it is a two-year deal for the 54-year-old.
""I chose to fly under the radar during this hiring process, and my experience generated a lot of interest from a number of NFL teams prior to coming to this decision.""

Bieniemy became a hot candidate after his success as the offensive coordinator of the Kansas City Chiefs. He spent 10 seasons with the Chiefs, and he won two Super Bowls with Kansas City before heading to Washington.

Bieniemy did not have similar success in the nation's capital, though. Washington quarterback Sam Howell is no Patrick Mahomes, but the Commanders went 4-13, and their offense ranked 21st in yards per game.
UCLA has had some coaching turnover this offseason. Chip Kelly left his head coaching gig with the Bruins to join Ohio State as offensive coordinator earlier this month.

The Buffalo Bills made a plethora of moves to get under the 2024 NFL salary cap, and two Pro Bowlers became cap casualties.
Safety Jordan Poyer, an All-Pro in 2021, was among them, along with center Mitch Morse, punt return specialist Deonte Harty, cornerback Siran Neal and running back Nyheim Hines.
The Bills were also set to release Tre'Davious White and designate him as a post-June 1 cut, ESPN reported. The team is also set to restructure cornerback Rasul Douglas' contract.

The Bills were around $32.5 million over the salary cap, per Over The Cap.
Poyer was set to be a $7.72 million salary cap hit, but the Bills saved $5.72 million with his release. They will take a $2 million dead cap hit, though.
BILLS' JOSH ALLEN'S EX TALKS HAVING ‘SEX AND THE CITY’ MOMENT FOLLOWING SPLIT FROM NFL STAR
A defensive captain, Poyer has been a mainstay on the Bills’ defense for the past seven seasons, working alongside Micah Hyde as arguably the best safety tandem in the NFL.
Poyer was an All-Pro during the 2021 season, collecting five interceptions, 93 tackles and nine passes defended with three sacks as well. He was also a Pro Bowler in 2022 before totaling 100 tackles in 2023.

But, while it’s a hard loss for the Bills on the field and in their locker room with his leadership, Poyer joins a strong free agent class that also includes former New York Giants safety Xavier McKinney at his position.
Poyer will be entering his 12th NFL season, which began in Philadelphia as a seventh-round draft pick by the Eagles in 2013. He didn’t last long there, though, as he played more for the Cleveland Browns his rookie season.
He would spent three more seasons in Cleveland before making the leap to Buffalo, where he found a niche in Orchard Park, New York. Poyer immediately started in the Bills’ secondary and hasn’t shed that role since.
As for White, the Bills will save $10.2 million by designating him a post-June 1 cut, while taking on a $6.2 million dead cap hit.

White was one of the key injuries that came for Buffalo's defense this season, tearing his Achilles on Oct. 1 to end his season.
The 27th overall pick of the 2017 NFL Draft, White broke out in 2019 with six interceptions to lead the league with a total of 17 passes defended and 58 tackles through 15 games. He earned first-team All-Pro honors and his first Pro Bowl.
He followed that up in 2020 with another Pro Bowl season that saw three more interceptions tallied.

Scott Hamilton, who won figure skating gold for the U.S. in the 1984 Olympics, revealed on Wednesday that he will hold off on treating a third brain tumor until he shows symptoms.
Hamilton went through surgery twice to deal with cancer in his brain, in 2004 and 2010. The second time was more complicated than the first as he dealt with nine different surgeries. He told People magazine he did not want to go through another ""complicated"" surgery.

""When they gave me the diagnosis, they said, it's back,"" he told the magazine. ""And so they brought in this guy, a really young, talented surgeon, and he said, 'We could do the surgery again. It'd be complicated, but we've got really talented people here that we could bring in, and I know we could pull it off if that's an option for you.’""
Hamilton said he told his doctor he was going to ""go home and get strong"" instead of immediately jumping onto the operating table again. He said this current tumor had shrunk initially, but when he got back for a checkup in early 2020, it had grown a bit again.

""And then COVID hit and going into any kind of hospital situation was almost impossible,"" Hamilton said. ""So in my spirit, in my inner being, I realized, I'm totally at peace with not even looking at it again unless I become symptomatic.
""The ace I have up my sleeve is that now there is a targeted radiation therapy that will shrink the tumor,"" he continued. ""And in that, I can avoid a lot of other things like surgery and chemo. So I don't know, I'm mostly trying to be in the moment and taking all the information and do the right thing when the time comes.""

Jax was strong all night. She nailed Ripley with an ""Annihilator,"" and then when that wasn’t enough, she brought the fight to the outside of the ring. She tried to put Ripley through the announcer table with a fallaway slam, but the table didn’t budge.

However, the leader of the Judgment Day countered, Jax and got back into a position to win it as the two got back into the ring. Ripley completed a suplex from the middle turnbuckle and then finished Jax off with the Riptide.

Longtime Major League Baseball umpire Ángel Hernández is known for having a relatively low tolerance for criticism.
During Friday's spring training game between the St. Louis Cardinals and Washington Nationals, Hernández's short fuse was on full display when he ejected pitcher Lance Lynn twice.
Lynn, who was making his spring training debut, appeared to take issue with Hernández's strike zone in the third inning. The umpire ejected the right-hander from the exhibition game.

According to MLB.com writer John Denton’s posts on X, Lynn said Hernández ""started chirping at the (Cardinals) dugout and I told him, ‘They know it was a strike.’ He told me, ‘Let’s go!’ And I told him, ‘I have five seconds on the pitch clock and I’ll start whenever I feel like it’. ... I threw the next pitch and I was like, ‘There’s a strike!’ And then it was ‘see you later.’'
In a somewhat unusual move, Lynn decided to go to the Cardinals' bullpen in an apparent effort to get some more work in.

Lynn allowed four runs on three hits and three walks in two innings of work. He had two strikeouts while throwing 25 of his 44 pitches for strikes.
Cardinals manager Oliver Marmol also got ejected. Lynn waved at the crowd as they walked together through the outfield toward the clubhouse.

Hernández, who was hired as a big league umpire in 1993, has been controversial on the field at times. He had three calls at first base overturned by video review during Game 3 of the 2018 American League Division Series between the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox.
Hernandez helped trigger a viral moment last September when he ejected Philadelphia Phillies star Bryce Harper from a game. An emotional Harper then threw his helmet into the stands.

The series began in 1993 with the release of Bill Walsh College Football, and the game was released under the legendary coach's name for two years. The name changed to College Football USA for the 1996 and 1997 seasons before changing to NCAA Football from 1998 to 2014.
The game was on hiatus for a while due to disputes among EA, the NCAA and college athletes. Each installment since the 1997 version featured a cover athlete as video games normally do.

Joey Logano started the Shriners Children’s 500 at Phoenix Raceway in 23rd but ended his day in the garage after a crash on Lap 206 with John Hunter Nemechek.
Nemechek made contact with Logano and the No. 22 Team Penske car spun around and collected Josh Berry, Corey LaJoie, Derek Kraus and Zane Smith in the process. Logano took a few licks from the other vehicles, but he managed to leave his car and walk into the ambulance to get checked out.

Logano called out Nemechek after he was released from the infield care center. Nemechek said on his radio with his team he felt Logano slowed down and he didn’t mean to hit him.

""I didn’t slow him down. Well, you gotta lift when you make the corners,"" he told FOX Sports. ""You can’t hold it wide open around Phoenix. Maybe he should take a look and realize he can’t do that, too.
""He drove straight in the back of me. He’s to be man enough to own up to that.""

Logan finished 34th in the race. He was one of four drivers who didn’t complete the race. LaJoie, Kraus and Austin Cindric were the others.
It’s been a rough start to the 2024 Cup Series season for the two-time champion.
The 34th-place finish at Phoenix was the third time this year he finished outside of the top 25. He was 32nd at Daytona and 28th at Atlanta. He was trying to build some momentum off a ninth-place finish at Las Vegas last weekend but couldn’t avoid the wreck.

Front Office Sports first reported the identifications, which were later confirmed to Fox News Digital.
""Yes, I can confirm that these names are correct,"" Ann Callis, an attorney for accuser Janel Grant, said in a statement.
WWE didn’t comment when asked by Fox News Digital.
A WWE spokesperson told Front Office Sports: ""WWE takes Ms. Grant’s allegations very seriously and has no tolerance for any physical abuse or unwanted physical contact. Neither Nick Khan nor Brad Blum, prior to the lawsuit being filed on January 25, 2024, were aware of any allegation by Ms. Grant that she was the victim of abuse or unwanted physical contact; nor does the complaint allege that either had knowledge of such.""
Khan, Blum, Stephanie McMahon and Nurse do not face any explicit claims of knowing about the alleged sexual abuse that occurred to Grant. The lawsuit claimed that they ""covered up exploitation in ways that make WWE liable under federal anti-trafficking law,"" according to Front Office Sports.

Grant’s lawsuit against Vince McMahon was filed in January. She alleged in the 67-page complaint that McMahon lured her to the company with the promises of a stellar career only to be sexually exploited by him and people he called his ""friends"" between 2019 and 2022.

"March 7, 2024 4:55pm EST",Riley Gaines reflects on when she became advocate for women's sports: 'What in the world are we clapping for?',Fox News,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Riley Gaines became the face of fairness in women's sports, but it wasn't exactly in her plans to do so.
Gaines decided to speak out against biological males in women's sports shortly after Lia Thomas, a transgender female, took home the 2022 NCAA Division I title for the 500-yard freestyle.
But earlier that season, Gaines actually had no idea who Thomas was.

In the 2020-21 season, Gaines was ranked seventh in the country. Of course, she wanted to be at the top for her senior season the next year.
Early in the 2021-22 season, Gaines says she was on track to be there, ranking third by mere hundredths of a second. However, she had never heard of the person who was in first place ""by body-lengths.""
Gaines and her teammates were confused about this mystery swimmer, and she ""continued to stay in the dark"" until an article revealed Thomas' identity as a biological male.
Ironically, Gaines said she felt a ""sense of relief.""
""I thought the NCAA would see this how I saw it, how my teammates saw it, how my coaches saw it, how my family saw it, how anyone with any amount of brain activity would probably comprehend this,"" Gaines told Joe Rogan on his podcast. Nothing hateful about it, nothing even opinionated about it.""
However, the NCAA said Thomas' participation in women's events was ""non-negotiable,"" Gaines said.
""There was no questions that we could ask or concerns that we could raise. We were told we had to accept this with a smile on our face, . . ."" she said. ""We were told we fully had to treat this person as a woman.""
Gaines remained silent, though, until she felt she no longer could.

FORMER TRACK COACH SENTENCED TO 5 YEARS IN JAIL FOR DUPING ATHLETES INTO SENDING NUDE PHOTOS
Gaines and Thomas actually tied for fifth place in the 200-yard freestyle championship. ""Incredibly embarrassing for a 6'4"" man to not even be able to beat a 5'5"" female,"" Gaines quipped. However, when it came time to receive trophies and go to the podium, the NCAA said they only had one trophy for the two swimmers, and gave it to Thomas.
Shortly afterwards, Gaines said the NCAA told her it was ""crucial"" that the trophy was in Thomas' hands during photos.
That's when Gaines, she says, ""felt guilty for participating in the farce."" When others in the crowd were celebrating Thomas, Gaines had an epiphany: ""What in the world are we clapping for?""
So, Gaines was done being silent.
""How in the world as female athletes can we, as women, expect someone to stand up for us if we aren’t willing to stand up for us?"" she said.

""I knew all season the unfair competition was wrong. I knew all season that the locker room aspect was wrong. I knew that the silencing that we were facing from our universities, I knew all of that was wrong. We all did. But it wasn’t until this official reduced everything that we had worked our entire lives for down to a photo-op to validate the feelings and the identity of a man, at the expense of our own. That’s really when I decided I couldn’t continue being silent.""
Gaines has since founded the Riley Gaines Center at the Leadership Institute and hosts ""Gaines for Girls"" on OutKick.

The Denver Broncos will release Russell Wilson once free agency officially opens this month, the team said in a statement Monday.
""We spoke with Russell Wilson today to inform of his release after the start of the league year,"" general manager George Paton and head coach Sean Payton said in joint statement. ""On behalf of the Broncos, we thank Russell for his contributions and dedication to our team and community while wishing him the best as he continues his career.""

The Broncos said Wilson will officially be cut once the new league year begins on March 13.
Wilson thanked Broncos fans and his teammates for their support in a separate statement.
""Over these last two years, you have welcomed my family and me with open arms and have embraced us as members of the Denver community,"" he said. ""This city will always hold a special place in my heart. Our family grew here, we made countless memories and friendships, and formed relationships that will last a lifetime.""
He ended his statement, saying, ""Tough times don’t last, but tough people do.
""God’s got me. I am excited for what’s next.""
The Broncos acquired Wilson in a blockbuster trade from the Seattle Seahawks before the start of the 2022 season. Denver gave up multiple draft picks along with Noah Fant, Shelby Harris and Drew Lock in the deal.
Wilson was set to be the quarterback with new head coach Nathaniel Hackett. However, the Broncos stumbled out of the gate and finished 5-12.

The Broncos hired Payton to replace Hackett after the 2022 season, but Wilson eventually lost his job to Jarrett Stidham despite having a crucial win over the eventual Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs.
Wilson played in 15 games during the 2023 season. He had 3,070 passing yards, 26 touchdown passes and eight interceptions.
He said in a recent episode of the ""I AM ATHLETE"" podcast that he wanted to stay with the Broncos.
""I've got more fire than ever, honestly, especially over the past two years and what I've gone through,"" the 35-year-old Super Bowl champion said. ""Whether it's in Denver or somewhere else. I hope it's in Denver. I hope I get to finish there. I committed there. I want to be there.""
He added that he wanted to win at least two more Super Bowls in the next five years.
""For me, it's about winning. In the next five years, I want to win two,"" Wilson said. ""I want to feel the chill of that trophy again. I love the city and everything else, but you also want to be in a place that loves you, too. I want to win, that's all I care about.""
The Super Bowl champion quarterback will be free to find a new team in the offseason.

The Chicago Bears continue to spend money on their secondary this offseason as the team reportedly signed All-Pro safety Kevin Byard to a two-year deal.
Since Byard was released by the Philadelphia Eagles, he did not have to wait until the new league year began to ink a new deal.
CBS Sports first reported the agreement. The deal is worth $15 million at its base, NFL Network reported.

Byard, 30, visited the Bears on Friday, and it seems he likes what he sees with the organization, which has a spot for him to start following Eddie Jackson’s release to save salary cap space.
Byard was released by the Eagles, who were also looking to shed salary cap, and safety has been a position across the league that seems to be undervalued given many teams are releasing top talent. Players like Xavier McKinney and Justin Simmons will look to find new homes this week.
BEARS, JAYLON JOHNSON AGREE TO MASSIVE 4-YEAR EXTENSION AFTER BEING HIT WITH FRANCHISE TAG
But the two-time first-team All-Pro Byard joins a Bears team that is clearly looking to use its massive amounts of cap room to contend in 2024.
Bears GM Ryan Poles just gave cornerback Jaylon Johnson a long-term extension after an initial franchise tag. He signed a four-year deal worth $76 million with $54 million guaranteed.

So, Poles has invested in defense with Byard, Johnson, Montez Sweat at edge rusher (four years, $98 million) and linebacker with Tremaine Edmunds (four years, $72 million).
Now, armed with more cap space and two Top 10 2024 NFL Draft picks, including first overall, Poles is in position to make the Bears a more formidable group on paper next season.
Byard was traded to the Eagles from the Tennessee Titans in October. He finished the year with 122 combined tackles, one interception and three passes defended between the two teams.

The South Carolina women's basketball team is wrapping up another strong season under longtime head coach Dawn Staley.
Senior Gamecocks center Kamilla Cardoso has had a breakout season and will likely draw attention from multiple WNBA teams when she decides to declare for the draft.
Cardoso was born in Montes Claros, Brazil, and spent her freshman season with Syracuse.
Cardoso is in her third season with South Carolina. She moved into the starting lineup this year in place of Aliyah Boston, last year's Naismith College Player of the Year who was the No. 1 overall selection in last year's WNBA Draft.

Cardoso's outstanding performance this season has helped the Gamecocks to a 28-0 record. South Carolina hosts the Tennessee Volunteers Sunday in both teams' regular-season finale.
DAWN STALEY ON SIGNIFICANCE OF STATUE IN COLUMBIA WHERE CONFEDERATE FLAG ONCE STOOD: ‘BIGGER THAN BASKETBALL'
Cardoso has faced numerous setbacks during her rise to basketball stardom. She initially left her home country when she was in middle school and enrolled in a school in Tennessee, allowing Cardoso to hone her basketball skills.
Although Cardoso made strides, she had to contend with being thousands of miles away from her family. Despite feeling homesick at times and fighting through a language barrier, Cardoso landed an athletic scholarship to Syracuse.
She received Atlantic Coast Conference honors after her first season in upstate New York and decided to transfer to South Carolina, where she has continued to shine.
The Gamecocks shared a video Saturday of Cardoso's emotional reunion with her family.
""Family over everything,"" the South Carolina women's basketball program captioned the social media post.
""This is kind of an incredible moment for all of us … for someone that (has) made incredible sacrifices for her family for the past eight years …. just for this game, just for the game she loves,"" Staley said while addressing the team.
""We've got a chance to do something pretty special … yep Kamilla … Kamilla. Let's bring the people who also made that sacrifice for the past eight years.""

With a new GM in place in Las Vegas, some Raiders fans may have feared All-Pro wide receiver Davante Adams might be on the trading block.
Think again.
""He’s a Raider,"" Tom Telesco told reporters at the NFL Scouting Combine Tuesday about the prospect of trading Adams this offseason.

It’s no secret Adams showed frustration with the Raiders, especially after the departure of quarterback Derek Carr, who he had a good rapport with in 2022.
However, since Antonio Pierce took over as interim head coach last season, Adams has shown more optimism about the team and his situation. Pierce having the interim tag removed after the season to remain in place for 2024 and beyond also helped.
Luke Getsy, who Adams worked with in 2014 during his rookie year with the Green Bay Packers, is also in place as the team’s offensive coordinator.
RAIDERS' ANTONIO PIERCE EXPLAINS ‘JORDAN RULES’ HE'LL USE AGAINST PATRICK MAHOMES NEXT SEASON
""He's the type of coach that's open-minded. ... He's going to be open to hearing things from the veteran players that know how this thing works and the best way to do things,"" Adams said, per ESPN.
""Open-mindedness and, like I said, that innovation to the offense and a good run-pass balance. And that's what I'm used to, that West Coast style. Going to be fun getting to work on a new system, [yet] something that's a little bit more familiar.""
Telesco also discussed running back Josh Jacobs, another key Raider whose future is in question.
Since Telesco said he doesn’t ""anticipate"" using the franchise tag on anyone this offseason, Jacobs will become a free agent if Las Vegas doesn’t re-sign him.

However, Telesco’s comments about the driving force of the team’s offense sound promising.
""He's a Raider, and he was drafted by the Raiders, so he's a high-level player,"" he explained. ""So yeah, we're going to explore pretty hard to see if we can bring him back here and kind of go from there.

Adams had another 100-plus-reception season, but his 11.1 average yards per catch was the lowest of his career since 2015. He did, however, finish with 1,144 yards and eight touchdowns, though he had a league-leading 14 receiving touchdowns the season before under Carr.
The Raiders’ quarterback situation is one to monitor heading into the new year as well. Aidan O’Connell remains in the starting role he took over from Jimmy Garoppolo when Pierce took over.
Garoppolo, who is suspended to start the year due to a PED violation, isn’t expected to remain with the Raiders, the team he signed a three-year deal with last offseason, in 2024. So, Telesco could add a quarterback in free agency or the NFL Draft.

But Adams isn’t someone fans should be worried about leaving at this point. He will be playing in the third year of a five-year pact he signed with the team when he was traded from the Packers in 2022. Adams will have an opt-out in 2025.

"March 6, 2024 12:23pm EST",What to know about tennis star Simona Halep’s doping suspension and why it was reduced,Fox News,"Riley Gaines reacted to a Democrat witness's comments about men being unable to beat tennis champions Serena Williams during a Senate hearing
Simona Halep is allowed to resume her tennis career whenever she wants, now that a four-year doping suspension was reduced by the Court of Arbitration for Sport to nine months — and the two-time Grand Slam champion already has missed more time than that.
""I cannot wait to return to the tour,"" Halep said.
The ruling on her appeal came Tuesday from a three-judge panel at the court based in Lausanne, Switzerland, so it's too soon to know when to expect to see Halep back in competition. And CAS, as the highest judicial body in sports is known, did not release its full findings yet, just a summary, so it's also too soon to know all of the ins and outs of the reasons behind the decision.
FORMER TENNIS STAR MARIA SHARAPOVA DONS GLAMOROUS LOOK AT PARIS FASHION WEEK EVENT
Here is what you need to know about what happened:
Halep is a 32-year-old from Romania who has reached the pinnacle of her sport, reaching No. 1 in the WTA rankings and winning major championships at Wimbledon in 2019, by beating Serena Williams in the final, and at the French Open in 2018, by beating Sloane Stephens in the final. Halep's game is built primarily on defense and speedy court coverage.

Halep tested positive for the banned drug Roxadustat at the 2022 U.S. Open, where she lost in the first round to Daria Snigur of Ukraine 6-2, 0-6, 6-4. It was the first tour-level win of Snigur’s career. Roxadustat was approved for use in the European Union in 2021 to treat the symptoms of anemia caused by chronic kidney failure. It stimulates the body to produce more of the natural hormone erythropoietin, or EPO, which has long been a doping product favored by cyclists and distance runners to boost stamina. She was given a four-year ban that would have expired in 2026, in all likelihood meaning the end of her professional tennis career.
Halep, who was represented by lawyer Howard Jacobs, argued that she was exposed to a contaminated supplement, which caused her failed test. CAS determined Halep bore ""some level of fault or negligence"" for not exercising ""sufficient care"" while using the supplement, but ""she bore no significant fault or negligence."" So that is why, CAS said, ""her anti-doping rule violations were not intentional.""
In October 2022, Halep was provisionally barred from her sport because of the test that year. Then, in May 2023, she was accused of a second doping offense by the International Tennis Integrity Agency for irregularities in her Athlete Biological Passport. Those passports provide a baseline reading of substances in an athlete’s body and are considered a way to help chart doping, because fluctuations over time raise red flags. The ITIA wanted her initial punishment to be extended to six years in total. But Tuesday's ruling mentioned two tests she took about two weeks apart in September 2022 that led CAS to be ""not comfortably satisfied that an anti-doping rule violation"" related to her passport had occurred.
Probably not. Jacobs, Halep's lawyer, said Tuesday that the athlete ""has already initiated a lawsuit against the supplement company."" Jacobs also pointed out that the CAS panel's decision means her suspension would have ended in July 2023, so she ""should have been eligible"" to play in last year's U.S. Open and this January's Australian Open. The next Grand Slam tournament is the French Open, which begins in May.
""Throughout this long and difficult process, I have maintained my belief that the truth would eventually come out, and that a just decision would be reached, because I am and always have been a clean athlete,"" Halep said in a statement released by Jacobs. ""My faith in the process was tested by the scandalous accusations that were leveled against me, and by the seemingly unlimited resources that were aligned against me. But in the end, the truth prevailed, even if it took much longer than I wish it had.""

"March 11, 2024 7:36pm EDT","Giants land Brian Burns in trade with Panthers, shell out $150M extension: report",Fox News,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Things were looking bleak for New York Giants fans on Monday, as Saquon Barkley and Xavier McKinney headed elsewhere with agreed-upon deals with the Philadelphia Eagles and Green Bay Packers respectively.
But Giants GM Joe Schoen changed that with a blockbuster trade with the Carolina Panthers for two-time Pro Bowl edge rusher Brian Burns, per multiple reports.
The Giants are reportedly sending 2024 second- and fifth-round picks to the Panthers in exchange for Burns, who was set to play on the franchise tag this season if he didn’t get a long-term extension.

Well, that’s exactly what Schoen is dishing out, as Burns' agent, Todd France, told NFL Network he’s agreed to a five-year deal worth a maximum value of $150 million with $87.5 million guaranteed.
Burns, 25, is now the second-highest-paid edge rusher in the league.
Tensions were high between Burns and the Panthers, who couldn’t find common ground on a long-term extension after his rookie contract went up.
GIANTS AGREE TO 3-YEAR DEAL WITH SAQUON BARKLEY'S REPLACEMENT: REPORT
The 16th overall pick of the 2019 NFL Draft was looking for big money after putting together 46.0 sacks and 246 tackles over 80 games with Carolina, yet they used the franchise tag on him before the league deadline with the possibility that a trade may go down.
The Giants jumped on that chance, knowing they needed a more formidable defensive line. Kayvon Thibodeaux took a leap in 2023 and Dexter Lawrence inked a large extension this past offseason to remain the team’s interior force on defense.
Burns had eight sacks, 50 tackles, 18 quarterback hits and one forced fumble over 16 games in 2023 for a woeful Panthers team that finished with the league’s worst record.

This performance came after a career-high was set in 2022 with 12.5 sacks, 63 tackles, 22 quarterback hits, three passes defended and 17 tackles for loss over 16 games.
The Giants will be under new defensive direction this season, with former Tennessee Titans defensive coordinator Shane Bowen assuming the same role in East Rutherford, which was left vacant in Wink Martindale’s departure.
Schoen may not be done adding to the Giants’ defense either, with McKinney leaving a hole in the secondary at safety. But he was active on the offensive line, adding veteran guards Jon Runyan and Jermaine Eluemunor to address a high-priority need.
Running back Devin Singletary reportedly agreed to terms on a team friendly, three-year deal to replace Barkley in the backfield.

Pitcher Dylan Cease's name has been linked to trade rumors for quite some time.
On Wednesday, ESPN reported the long-awaited trade for the right-handed pitcher had been finalized.
Cease, who has spent his entire major league career with the Chicago White Sox, is expected to join the San Diego Padres.
The White Sox will receive multiple prospects in exchange for Cease, according to multiple reports. Cease, 28, had somewhat of a disappointing season in 2023, finishing with a 4.58 ERA after receiving the second most AL Cy Young Award votes in 2022.

Matt Araiza was a sixth-round pick in 2022, but he put the league on notice with his booming punts in training camp and preseason games. His powerful leg earned him the nickname ""Punt God.""
However, shortly before that NFL season was set to begin, Araiza was accused of being involved in a gang-rape of a 17-year-old at a college party at his alma mater of San Diego State University. He was then released by the Buffalo Bills.
Araiza fought to clear his name for roughly 16 months, and developments show as such.

Now, nearly two years after being drafted, he has agreed to join the back-to-back Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs.
""I am proud and honored to sign a contract with the Chiefs,"" Araiza said in a statement through his agency, JL Sports, on X. ""I am thrilled to be able to continue my NFL career.
""I want to thank my family, who have been my rock and my many friends who have been unwavering in their support. I am excited to begin the next phase of my career with the Super Bowl Champs!""
Araiza's accuser dropped the lawsuit last December. Prosecutors and the school both said the actions between the two were consensual.
The lawsuit alleged that Araiza had thrown the girl on a bed ""face first,"" and that she had gone in and out of consciousness while having unsolicited sex. The lawsuit added that it lasted an hour and a half, and that she left the room bloodied and crying.

Araiza admitted to having sex with her, having met her outside during the night in question, but not knowing that she was 17. However, it was revealed that Araiza was no longer at the party when the alleged gang rape occurred.
There were also videos of the incident inside the bedroom where prosecutors didn’t see enough to say it was a gang rape instead of consensual sex. Prosecutors also said the accuser had been lying about her age to other men at the party, saying she was 18.
Witnesses also said the girl had been leaving and returning to her friends, saying that she had had sex with someone. After the Araiza encounter, despite the civil lawsuit saying that he had led her to a bedroom, prosecutors found that she had left her friend group again and returned, saying that she had had sex with a different man. Deputy District Attorney Trisha Amador also made sure to point out again that the girl hadn't been under the influence.
There was another witness who claimed that the girl had been ""approaching men at the party saying, ‘I want you to [expletive] me, and if you don’t [expletive] me you’re a [expletive].""

Freedom has previously hinted that he would launch a bid for political office, but he cautioned that he would only do so at the appropriate time. Freedom, who was born in Switzerland but was primarily raised in Turkey, became an American citizen in 2021 and changed his last name to Freedom. He would not be eligible to hold a political office in the US until 2028.
""Everytime I go into Congress or (the) Senate, people are like 'What are you doing? What are you waiting for? You have an amazing shot at this.' But, we have this crazy rule . . . after you become a citizen you have to wait seven years to run for an office. So I became a citizen in 2021, so I am allowed to run into 2028.""

Caitlin Clark ranks among the top athletes on On3 Sports' NIL valuation list, which assigns a dollar amount based on the player's name, image and likeness and roster value.
Clark's NIL valuation is $3.1 million, according to On3. And though it's not a tracker of the NIL deals she's made in her college career, she may end up making less annually just playing in the WNBA with the potential to earn more through lucrative endorsement deals.

Some may wonder why Clark could be throwing away all that NIL money for a lower salary as a pro. But that actually may not be the case.
Michael Schreck, the co-founder of the Collegiate Sports Management Group, has negotiated media rights deals between several leagues and plenty of sporting events from the NFL to the Masters.
An expert in the field and a self-proclaimed college hoops aficionado, Schreck says the leverage and impact Clark will have on putting women's basketball on the map is astronomical, so orgoing her NIL money really isn't a risk at all.
""She's transcending sports right now, and not just women's sports. The amount of leverage she's going to bring wherever she goes. …"" Schreck said in a recent interview with Fox News Digital. ""She's literally put women's basketball, women's sports, at another level. … Yes, she's making a killing in NIL right now, but the reality is that all those brands are going to sign her long term with her new WNBA deal.

Two-time All-Pro defensive back Sauce Gardner said he was ""caught off guard"" by the recent comments from his former teammate Mecole Hardman. Hardman, who started the 2023 season on the New York Jets roster, recently sparked a war of words when he publicly criticized New York’s coaching staff and the organization overall.
Hardman suggested that the Jets culture was steeped in dysfunction in the weeks following quarterback Aaron Rodgers' season-ending injury.
""But the offense is just like, ‘We’ll just figure it out. It’s Aaron’s show. Let Aaron do what Aaron does.’ Then when Aaron goes down, it’s like we don’t know what to do,"" Gardner said last month during an appearance on ""The Pivot"" podcast.

Gardner made his own appearance on ""The Pivot"" this week and asserted that Hardman ""never earned his stripes"" when he was a member of the Jets. Gardner also described Hardman as ""ungrateful.""

""If you really know what it takes to win,"" Gardner said, ""you're going make sure you let the team know. ... The reason he couldn't do that is because he never earned his stripes. He came to the facility and thought he had it made for him.
""If you know what it takes to win, you're not going to go to practice and drop hella punts and then have excuses as to why you're dropping them. You're not going to go into a special teams meeting and get cussed out by the special teams coordinator. There's just certain things that are not going to happen if you truly know what it takes to win.""
Some other Jets players took issue with Hardman's remarks on the podcast and took to social media to fire back at the wide receiver.
Hardman spent the first four years of his career with the Kansas City Chiefs. He signed with the Jets in 2023. His impact during his five games with the Jets was minimal. He finished his stint in New York with just one reception for three yards. The Jets traded him back to the Chiefs in October.

"February 23, 2024 1:28pm EST",Russian Olympic Committee loses appeal against its suspension,Fox News,"In a Twitter video, Ukraine's President Zelenskyy repeatedly called on the Olympic Committee to not allow the ""terrorist state of Russia"" to participate in the Summer Olympic Games in Paris next year.
The Russian Olympic Committee has lost an appeal against its suspension by the International Olympic Committee.
The Court of Arbitration for Sport said Friday that it had dismissed the ROC's appeal against the suspension imposed in October. The IOC objected to the ROC incorporating four sports bodies representing regions of eastern Ukraine, which it calls ""a breach of the Olympic Charter"".
Russia was already barred by the IOC from entering athletes for the Paris Olympics under its own flag, and the suspension doesn't stop the IOC's efforts for Russians to compete as neutral athletes without national symbols.
RUSSIA, BELARUS NOT OFFICIALLY INVITED TO 2024 PARIS OLYMPICS, IOC SAYS
CAS said it found the suspension issued by the IOC executive board ""did not breach the principles of legality, equality, predictability or proportionality.""
The ROC said the CAS ruling, which has not yet been published in full, ""practically copied out the IOC's arguments"" and ignored the Russian case. The ROC can appeal to the Swiss supreme court but has not said if it plans to do so.
""This CAS ruling is yet more evidence that civil and sports discrimination directed against Russians has reached an unprecedented scale in the run-up to the Games in Paris,"" the ROC said in a statement.
The ROC said that CAS ""confirmed that the Olympic team of Russia, Russian athletes and officials will not take part in the Games of the XXXIII Olympiad in Paris, just as it excluded any possible cooperation by the ROC with athletes who the IOC recognizes as meeting the criteria of so-called neutrality.""
The IOC said Friday it was ""pleased"" by the CAS ruling its suspension of the ROC was valid.

The ROC’s decision to incorporate the sports bodies for the four Ukrainian regions ""constitutes a breach of the Olympic Charter because it violates the territorial integrity of the (National Olympic Committee) of Ukraine, as recognized by the International Olympic Committee in accordance with the Olympic Charter,"" the IOC said.
The suspension in October removed the ROC's right to receive funding from the IOC but has not affected the many Russians who are competing in international sports as neutral athletes as they attempt to qualify for this year’s Paris Olympics, as part of an IOC-backed initiative.
They would go to the Paris Games under the name of Individual Neutral Athletes, the IOC has said previously.
The IOC previously said it will bar ""athletes who actively support the war"" in Ukraine, but it is not requiring Russian athletes to speak out against it. The IOC has said that the suspension means it would not have to consult the ROC on which athletes to select.
The ROC said in its statement Friday that the neutral athlete procedure involved ""humiliating criteria"" and claimed that athletes could risk breaking Russian law by agreeing to them.

A similar Individual Neutral Athlete system is in place for athletes from Russia’s ally Belarus, where the National Olympic Committee is not suspended. The IOC earlier said it will consult with the Belarusian NOC about athlete selection for Paris.

""Amit Patel knowingly and wittingly created a deceptive scheme to fund a lavish lifestyle at his employer’s expense, and today’s sentencing is a warning to other scam artists: The FBI and our partners will continue to aggressively pursue corporate fraud investigations to protect consumers from bearing the costs associated with criminal activity,"" Mark Dargis, acting special agent in charge of the FBI Jacksonville Division, said in a statement.

Prosecutors say Patel used the stolen money to fund a lavish lifestyle that included online gambling, chartering private jets and the purchase of a private condominium in Ponte Vedra Beach, sports memorabilia, cars, spa treatments and other personal purchases.
Patel spent $5 million on a ""life of luxury"" that included purchases like a 1996 Tiger Woods’ putter, nearly $600,000 at Apple and more than $40,000 at Amazon and Best Buy combined, ESPN reported, citing court documents.
He spent most of the money on online sports gambling.

FORMER JAGUARS EMPLOYEE SPENT MILLIONS OF ALLEGED EMBEZZLED MONEY TO FUND 'LIFE OF LUXURY,' PROSECUTORS SAY
As part of his sentence, Patel was ordered to pay full restitution to the Jaguars. He has so far returned $1.89 million.
""I stand before you embarrassed, ashamed and disappointed for my actions,"" Patel, who’s attorneys claimed he had a gambling addiction, said at Tuesday’s hearing. ""It began small and then snowballed so big that my only thought was to gamble my way out of it. In the end, I always thought that big win was right around the corner and would fix all my problems.""
The investigation into Patel was triggered by an NFL investigation into his gambling. The case was then handed over to the FBI.

""Speaking on behalf of the Jaguars, we do know that we want to move on and forgive, not just Amit, but ourselves for trusting him only to watch him shame us, individually and collectively,"" Jaguars’ Chief Legal Officer Megha Parekh said in court Tuesday.

The Duke haters are out in full force Saturday night.
The Blue Devils have had some notorious players in their history, and many think Kyle Filipowski is the latest.
Saturday night's Duke-North Carolina matchup is much more than the best rivalry in college basketball.
The ACC title is on the line.

North Carolina, ranked seventh in the country, has clinched at least a share of the regular season crown. With a win Saturday, the Tar Heels will have sole possession of the title. They will split it with No. 9 Duke if the Blue Devils win.
In the first half, Filipowski and UNC's Harrison Ingram fell to the floor after Duke grabbed a defensive rebound.
Ingram got up first and attempted to run back on defense. But before he could take even two steps, he tripped over Filipowski's leg.
There was immediately debate about whether it was intentional, and the overwhelming social media reaction is that it was.
Some users on X, formerly Twitter, joked that Filipowski had changed his stance on making contact with players on the court, referencing his injuries from when Wake Forest fans stormed the court against the Blue Devils a couple weeks ago.

""Kyle Filipowski’s leg has healed so miraculously he can even trip opposing players with it,"" Sportsgrid host Ben Stevens wrote.
""This is significantly more egregious than anything, any Wake Forest student did to Kyle Filipowski,"" added Fox Sports Radio host Aaron Torres.
Filipowski doesn't get the benefit of the doubt considering who he plays for, and many were quick to compare him to a Duke alum accused of his fair share of dirty plays.
""Grayson? Is that you?"" The Field of 68 posted.
""Shades of Grayson Allen,"" added Jackson Didlake.

Duke trailed the Tar Heels, 40-31, at half, but opened the second half on an 11-3 run to get to within one. However, that was the closest Duke would get, as UNC took home an 84-79 win, sweeping the season series and winning the ACC regular season title outright for the first time since 2017.

It’s been a rough couple of days, but it’s really, really nice to see the support for Erik.""
Police said the driver of the vehicle, a valet driver at the Opal Sands, remained on the scene and has been cooperative in the investigation.
Swanson is in his second spring with Toronto after being traded by the Seattle Mariners in the 2022 offseason. Toronto sent Teoscar Hernandez as part of the deal.
Swanson struggled in his first two seasons, pitching to a 6.58 in 36 appearances in 2019 and 2020 — but he's found success in the previous three years.
Since 2021, he owns an ERA of 2.60, including a career-best 1.68 ERA in 2022.

Last year, Swanson had a 2.97 ERA while striking out 10.1 batters per nine innings. Out of his 69 appearances, he kept opponents scoreless in 55 of them.
From Aug. 7 through the end of the season, he allowed just two earned runs in 16.1 innings (1.10 ERA).

Troy Vincent, NFL executive vice president of football operations and former Philadelphia Eagles star, expressed support for a change in kickoffs amid a report the play was discussed over the weekend.
Vincent said Monday there was ""no question"" a proposal for kickoffs will be on the table in the offseason, according to NFL.com. The NFL competition committee met about kickoffs over the weekend, The Washington Post reported.

""We know we won’t go back into what we saw last year, when it became a ceremonial play,"" Vincent said.""
The committee could make a proposal to alter the kickoffs to make it look more like how the XFL did in 2023, the Washington Post reported, citing a source.
The rule would need to receive 24 votes to be enacted. The NFL changed the rule last season, allowing fair catches on kickoffs. However, the Washington Post reported that rule was only made for one season.
My perspective has been that we have to keep the kickoff in the game,"" Atlanta Falcons CEO Rich McKay told the newspaper. ""And to do that, we have to find a way to modernize it and get that play going again, because that 20% return rate is not what was intended for that [fair catch] rule.""

BILLS' DION DAWKINS GOES SCORCHED-EARTH ON JETS IN INTERVIEW: 'I HATE THEM'
In the XFL, kickoffs were taken from the kicking team’s 30-yard line. The members of the kicking team lined up at the receiving team’s 35-yard line, and blockers on the receiving team line up on their own 30-yard line. Only the kicker and the returner can move until the ball is caught or 3 seconds after the ball hits the ground. Kickoffs that sail out of bounds or fall short of the receiving team’s 20-yard line move to the kicking team’s 45-yard line.
A touchback occurs when the ball travels into the end zone or bounces into the end zone. If it sails into the end zone without touching the ground, the receiving team gets the ball at the 35. If it bounces into the end zone, the receiving team gets the ball at the 15.
A team can request an onside kick. It has to travel at least 10 yards but not more than 20 yards. A team could also decide to go for the 4th-and-15 option instead of the kickoff. If they convert, they keep the ball.

Miami Dolphins wide receiver Tyreek Hill was reportedly involved in an alteration during Kevin Hart’s comedy event at the Coca-Cola Roxy in Atlanta on Friday night.
The incident allegedly began when Hill was grabbed by a woman who claimed the receiver was sitting in the seat she had paid for at Coca-Cola Roxy.
Hill did not get physical with the woman and simply tried to walk away from the situation, according to TMZ.

However, things escalated when the woman, this time with ""a male companion,"" started a verbal exchange with Hill’s friends. That turned into a physical altercation when the woman allegedly pushed someone from Hill’s group as tensions rose.
Security at the Coca-Cola Roxy stepped in before Cobb County Police Department officers responded to the scene.
Cobb County police reportedly reviewed the video of the altercation and found the woman was the aggressor in this case. In turn, she and the male companion were detained in handcuffs at the scene.

TMZ added that those who were involved in the incident with the man and woman did not want to cooperate with police and didn’t press any charges.

Fox News Digital could not reach the Coca-Cola Roxy for confirmation of the altercation.
Since the NFL offseason began, Hill has been involved in numerous off-the-field situations, including a social media influencer claiming Hill broke her leg at his property last summer. An attorney representing Hill recently denied all allegations against his client.
Hill has also been involved in a divorce drama with his wife, Keeta Vaccaro, which he discussed this month on ""The Pivot"" podcast with Fred Taylor, Ryan Clark and Channing Crowder. Hill denied he was getting divorced and said the filing in Florida was a mistake.
This year hasn't been a good start for Hill, whose home caught fire in what officials ruled was accidental and caused by a child. Helicopters outside his home appeared to show Hill upset while talking to Vaccaro.

The San Francisco Giants signed infielder Matt Chapman to a one-year contract Sunday as the team looked to bolster its roster before the start of the 2024 regular season.
In the middle of the offseason, the Giants were described as not being a desirable team to play for because of the issues the city has had with crime and drugs over the last year. Former Giants star Buster Posey hinted as much after the team missed out on signing Shohei Ohtani.
""Something I think is noteworthy, something that unfortunately keeps popping up from players and even the players’ wives, is there’s a bit of an uneasiness with the city itself, as far as the state of the city, with crime, with drugs,"" Posey told The Athletic.

""Whether that’s all completely fair or not, perception is reality. It’s a frustrating cycle, I think, and not just with baseball. Baseball is secondary to life and the important things in life. But as far as a free-agent pursuit goes, I have seen that it does affect things.""
But Chapman pushed back on that narrative in his press conference on Monday.
""I chose to come here. I think everybody's different, everybody has different things that matter to them, but I'm from California. I played in the Bay Area. I'm comfortable here,"" Chapman said, via NBC Sports Bay Area. ""And people say what they say, but I think at the end of the day when you look at the franchise, they want to win. They've won before. They know how to do it.
""They have great players, great coaches. So, I don't see why people wouldn't want to come here, and I know that a lot of people have reached out and said they want to come play here and told me that. So I think if that's a narrative, it's going to change.""

Charles Barkley made comments about the city during the NBA All-Star Game. He said ""you can’t even walk around down there.""
When Draymond Green pushed back, Barkley then agreed that people can walk around San Francisco but ""with a bulletproof vest.""
San Francisco officials tried to push back on the narrative in January, saying the city’s crime rate was ""lower than any period in the last ten years"" aside from 2020. The city said there was a 7% decrease in crime from 2022 and a 13% decrease in crime from 2019.

""Our work around public safety is making a difference, but we’ve got more work to do,"" San Francisco Mayor London Breed said in a release last month.

Alabama Crimson Tide forward Mohamed Wague was suspended one game for elbowing Florida center Alex Condon in the back of the head during their matchup, the SEC announced Thursday.

Wague will miss Saturday’s game against Kentucky.
""NCAA rules require a suspension for the next regular-season game when a player commits an act of fighting defined as ‘a confrontation involving one or more players, coaches or other team personnel wherein (but not limited to) a fist, hand, arm, foot, knee or leg is used to combatively strike the other individual,’"" the SEC added.

Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Tee Higgins reportedly requested a trade Monday as the league’s contract negotiation period in free agency gets set to open.
The Bengals used the franchise tag on Higgins as it appeared the two sides were going to potentially negotiate a contract extension. But the NFL Network reported that Higgins’ side had no discussion about a long-term deal before the player received the tag.

If Higgins signs the tag, he will play for the Bengals on a one-year contract worth $21.8 million. Bengals coach Zac Taylor suggested that Higgins would be a part of the offense moving forward.
""Tee has done an outstanding job for us since we drafted him in 2020,"" he said in a statement when Higgins received the tag. ""I’m glad that he’ll continue to be a big part of our offense and our team.""
But that appeared to change Monday.
The Bengals selected Higgins in the second round of the 2020 NFL Draft. He quickly became among the top targets for Joe Burrow and fit nicely as the No. 2 wide receiver along with Ja’Marr Chase. His targets increased from his rookie season to his second year, even with the addition of Chase.

RUSSELL WILSON ANNOUNCES HE WILL SIGN WITH STEELERS FOR 2024 SEASON
Last season, Higgins only played in 12 games as Cincinnati was bit by the injury bug. He had 42 catches for 656 yards and five touchdown catches. Cincinnati finished 9-8.
He has 257 catches for 3,684 yards and 24 touchdowns in his first four NFL seasons.
It’s unclear which teams could be interested in Higgins.

""Just feel bad for Russ right now,"" Lue said. ""You never want to see a player get hurt. [Washington's Jordan] Poole drove around, and he tried to deflect it from the back. I think he hit his elbow with his hand.""

Westbrook exited Friday's game in the second quarter and did not return. He finished the contest with six points. Lue said the amount of time Westbrook will miss remains unclear.

Ten-time NBA All-Star James Harden said the team will miss ""everything he brings to the game.""
""His athleticism,"" Harden explained. ""His energy. His playmaking ability. His leadership.""
The Clippers did receive some positive news on the injury front. Paul George is expected to return from a two-game absence after experiencing discomfort in his left knee.

""I just needed some time off,"" George said. ""It was a rough stretch going into the [All-Star] break, coming out of the break. And, so, just my body needed that rest. But I felt good tonight and was able to walk out clean.""
Westbrook entered the 2023-24 season as the starting point guard, but his role changed shortly after the team traded for Harden in October. Westbrook relinquished his position in the starting lineup and, since that move, the Clippers have won 35 of 48 games.

The No. 5 Hendrick Motorsports driver won the fall race at Las Vegas last season and gave his team its second victory in the first three races of the season. Reddick, who nearly made the Championship Four last season, just didn’t have enough to catch Larson in the final laps.

""I knew Tyler was going to be the guy to beat from the first stage,"" Larson told FOX Sports’ Jamie Little after the race. ""He was really fast there. I was hoping those guys were going to get racing a little bit longer because I felt like it was going to timeout where he was running really hard and getting the Toyota to catch me at the end.
""Thankfully, was able to air block him a couple laps and get him tight. … All and all, such a great job by this Hendrick Cars’ Chevy team – just their execution.""

Jake Paul predicted a second-round knockout on Saturday night - he was too generous.
The YouTuber turned boxer earned a first-round victory over Ryan Bourland on Saturday night in Puerto Rico (he was accurate in his sub-six-minute victory).
Paul clearly wanted to get things over with early, striking early and connected on a hard shot to the ribs - Bourland's left side was clearly red after the blow.

But shortly after, Paul took it a step further, piecing up Bourland in the face and making the former Golden Gloves champion dazed.
Bourland couldn't even return with any jabs, going in straight self-defense mode. But it wasn't enough.
Trapping him in the corner, Paul threw a bunch of haymakers, and the referee called it a night. The fight lasted just two minutes and 37 seconds.
""I wanted it to be a little longer to give the fans some more time,"" he admitted post-fight.

Paul also told Fox News Digital earlier this week he was ""pissed"" that his previous fight also lasted less than one round.
Paul called himself ""the face of this sport,"" rhetorically asking, ""who's doing more for boxing than me?""
He probably would admit, though, he isn't the best yet - but he did call out someone in that category.
""Hey Canelo, stop ducking. I know you want it,"" he said, firing at current WBA, WBC, IBF, and WBO champion Canelo Alvarez.

Reggie Bush helped USC to two national championship game appearances, winning in 2004, and also the Heisman Trophy as a junior in 2005.
However, he was later forced to forfeit his award after an investigation found that he had violated NCAA policy by accepting money and gifts. Their title was also vacated.
Nearly 14 years since Bush voluntarily relinquished the trophy, he's been fighting to get it back, and one fellow Heisman Trophy winner wants the Heisman Trophy Trust to make things right.

Johnny Manziel, who won the trophy as a freshman in 2012, has been critical of Bush not owning his trophy, but he has taken it a notch further.
""After careful thought and consideration I will be humbly removing myself from the Heisman trophy ceremony until @ReggieBush gets his trophy back,"" Manziel posted on X. ""Doesn't sit right with my morals and values that he can't be on that stage with us every year. Reggie IS the Heisman trophy. Do the RIGHT thing @NCAA the ball is in your court.""
Last year, Manziel wrote on social media that ""there is nothing I want to see more than for Reggie to get his Heisman back.""
""I think what the NCAA did in that situation is complete bull---t. He is one of the best college football players in history and deserves to be on that stage with us every year,"" he continued at the time.

In 2021, the Heisman Trust seemed to give hope to the idea that Bush could one day have his trophy returned. Shortly after the name, image, and likeness rules went into effect, Heisman Trust organizers said it would be more than happy to welcome back the USC star ""should the NCAA reinstate Bush's 2005 status.""
Bush released a statement in July 2021 demanding his records be reinstated, and his trophy given back.
""It is my strong belief that I won the Heisman trophy ‘solely’ due to my hard work and dedication on the football field and it is also my firm belief that my records should be reinstated,"" he said in a statement.
Bush rushed for 3,169 yards and 25 touchdowns and completed 95 passes for 1,301 yards and 13 touchdowns in his three years at USC. He was named Pac-10 Offensive Player of the year in 2004 and 2005, among several other honors, and was the second overall pick in the 2006 NFL Draft.

The Manasquan Board of Education in New Jersey has filed a lawsuit after referees blew a call that should have sent the Jersey Shore school to the state championship.
Manasquan’s Rey Weinseimer missed a three-pointer from the wing, but his teammate Griffin Linstra was there to grab the rebound and put the shot back in for what the team thought was the game-winning basket. The Manasquan fans went wild as Camden was in disbelief.
However, referees reversed the decision, resulting in a 46-45 victory for Camden. Several videos showed that the shot clearly should have counted, and referees and the New Jersey State Interccholatistic Athletic Association (NJSIAA) admitted and apologized for the ""error.""

The NJSIAA said in a statement, though, that ""the rules are clear,"" and the result would not be overturned.
The lawsuit is asking for an ""injunctive relief"" and for the state's Group 2 championship game, slated for Saturday at Rutgers University, to be put on hold.
""We’re asking Judge [Mark] Troncone to put the brakes on this game on Saturday pending judicial review of what happened"" the Clark Law Firm told NJ Advance Media. ""What we’re trying to do is put the brakes on the game pending on who should be the right team to be in that game and declare Manasquan the winner. We will argue that the NJSIAA’s rules would require them to use the videotape to get the right result here.""

""We appreciate the NJSIAA’s transparency in admitting the error in the calling of last night’s Group 2 Semifinal Boys Basketball game and appreciate their apology,"" the Manasquan school district said in a statement earlier this week. ""It is indeed ‘frustrating,’ however, that the NJSIAA refuses to exercise its discretion to remedy a situation that was so obvious and well documented.
""In our unwavering support of our players, coaches and families, the District will continue to pursue any available appeals we can to vindicate the values of fair play and integrity that should be the hallmarks of interscholastic athletics.""

The Los Angeles Dodgers got to see their other Japanese phenom in action on Wednesday as right-handed starter Yoshinobu Yamamoto took the mound in spring training.
Many eyes are on Shohei Ohtani and his record $700 million, 10-year contract he signed with the Dodgers this offseason, but Los Angeles went over a billion dollars when Yamamoto, the top starter on the market after dominating the Nippon Professional Baseball league in Japan, signed a $325 million deal over 12 years.
Well, Yamamoto showed everyone why the Dodgers put lots of faith in him, especially financially, in just two innings of work for his first outing in MLB.

Taking on the reigning World Series champion Texas Rangers, Yamamoto's first batter was Marcus Semien, and he shot right out of the gate with a strikeout. On a 2-2 count, he pumped a fastball high in the zone, which Semien swung right through for the first out.
Evan Carter was able to get a single off Yamamoto, but Wyatt Langford grounded out into a double play to end the inning.

In the second, Yamamoto looked even more dialed in as he got Nathaniel Lowe to swing and miss at a filthy splitter, which hit the dirt.
Then, after Jonah Heim flew out to left field, Leody Taveras was set down on three pitches for Yamamoto’s third strikeout of the day.

Of course, spring training outings, especially in the beginning, are going to be short to avoid fatiguing pitchers before the regular season. But the Dodgers must be feeling great after seeing Yamamoto going against his first batters that won’t be teammates this season.
The 25-year-old went through his entire pitch arsenal through his two innings, showing the life his high-90s fastball has, as well as that splitter and a tight-breaking curveball.
Yamamoto’s performance in Japan captivated every MLB scout looking to get him in their starting rotation. He posted a 1.72 ERA in 967.2 innings over seven seasons in the NPB.
At 25 years old, a talent like Yamamoto doesn’t come often, and the Dodgers weren’t shutting their checkbooks after the Ohtani deal.

WWE star Austin Theory appeared to get into a heated argument with an Australian newspaper editor as the pro wrestler was in the newsroom to promote the company’s upcoming Elimination Chamber premium live event in Perth.
A video circulated across social media showed Theory yelling at The West Australian’s editor-in-chief Anthony De Cegile. Theory was seen in a video asking De Cegile to repeat himself.
""I mean, it’s fake…"" De Cegile says in the clip. ""Like, you’re not actually hitting each other.""

The West Australian reported that Theory took issue with pro wrestling being called ""fake"" and not as difficult as Australian Rules football or Rugby League. For what it’s worth, Elimination Chamber will take place Saturday at Optus Stadium – the home of the Australian Football League’s West Coast Eagles and Fermantle Football Club.
Theory then teed off on De Cegile.
""Hold on a second, you brought me in here and you’re going to talk to me like this? No man. Just cause you’re in charge of some s--- here, man, doesn’t mean you can talk to me like this,"" Theory said.
De Cegile said he didn’t mean to offend Theory.
""You’re saying what I do is easy and you’re in front of all your people in here talking about my job’s easy,"" Theory said. ""You couldn’t walk a damn day in my shoes.… Are you kidding me, man? I’ll smack the s--- out of you right now. I’m not playing around.
""You bring me out here for some media, man. This guy’s talking his f---ing head off, man. What’s his problem, dude?""

It wasn’t clear if the back-and-forth was a work or not. Theory, a former United States Champion, works as a heel on the roster with Australian native Grayson Waller in his corner.
Waller had a similar incident on Australia’s Seven Network when he warned an off-camera floor manager that he would give the off-camera a straight punch after feeling disrespected during a segment.

""But, you know, there’s distance, which is never a great thing. So, there’s always been that little bit of, ‘we think, we think, we think,’ so to finally see that announcement, not only is it just a live event, it’s Elimination Chamber – which is a show that basically sets up WrestleMania. It’s going to be a huge show in Perth. Optus Stadium – that’s a huge stadium, too.

Calvin Ridley won’t be heading back to the Jacksonville Jaguars next season, but he’s instead choosing the Tennessee Titans in a surprise free agent move, according to multiple reports.
All signs pointed to Ridley returning to Duval County, as reports since the NFL’s legal tampering period began Monday said he was trying to work things out with the Jags.
The Titans came in with an incredible offer for the 29-year-old receiver, as he signed a deal worth $92 million over four years with $50 million guaranteed, according to multiple reports.

That would be $23 million per season for Ridley, who is coming off a 1,016-yard season with eight touchdowns. It was his first year playing for the Jaguars after previously missing the entire 2022 season for violating the NFL’s gambling policy.
Ridley, who was traded by the Atlanta Falcons to the Jaguars during his suspension, caught 76 passes on 136 targets last season with Trevor Lawrence as his quarterback.
EX-JAGUARS EMPLOYEE SENTENCED TO MORE THAN 6 YEARS IN PRISON FOR $22 MILLION EMBEZZLEMENT SCHEME
While the deal wasn't announced, Ridley's agent, David Mulugheta, who negotiated the contract with the Titans, posted a FaceTime screenshot of himself and Ridley with the caption, ""The face you make when you hear about the bag you getting!""
Now, Ridley goes to a less-solidified quarterback room in Tennessee.
Last year's head coach Mike Vrabel chose Will Levis to start over Ryan Tannehill midway through the 2023 season in a baptism-by-fire scenario with Tennessee not seeing playoffs in sight.

While Levis should be the expected starter entering camp, the Titans signed Mason Rudolph to compete with him along with Malik Willis.
But whoever is the Titans’ starting signal caller will surely enjoy the wide receivers they get to work with.
Other than Ridley, DeAndre Hopkins and Treylon Burks remain in place. The Titans also agreed to terms on a deal with former Dallas Cowboys running back Tony Pollard to replace Derrick Henry next season.

Race marshal William Palfrey’s three-person panel of officials investigated the circumstances surrounding the death of the moose. If a musher kills an animal on the trail, like a moose or caribou, in self-defense or property during the race, the musher is required to guy the animal and report it to officials at the next checkpoint.
The panel determined that Seavey spent about 10 minutes at the kill site and then mushed his dogs about 11 miles before camping out on a three-hour layover. He left the camp site at 5:55 a.m. local time and arrived at the next checkpoint at 8 a.m., when Seavey reported the kill.

""It fell on my sled; it was sprawled on the trail,"" Seavey told Iditarod Insider TV at the checkpoint. ""I gutted it the best I could, but it was ugly.""
Seavey implored race officials to get the moose off the trail during his interview. Race officials, though, determined ""the animal was not sufficiently gutted by the musher."" Officials said Seavey was required to get out the intestines and other internal organs. The moose was later retrieved and the animal’s meat was salvaged and processed.
Officials said a two-hour penalty would be added to Seavey’s mandatory 24-hour layover.

"March 3, 2024 2:58pm EST",NFL legend Emmitt Smith rips University of Florida for eliminating DEI positions,Fox News,"'Gutfeld!' panelists react to reports accusing Harvard chief diversity and inclusion officer Sherri Ann Charleston of 40 instances of plagiarism.
Emmitt Smith, a three-time Super Bowl champion with the Dallas Cowboys and former star running back with the Florida Gators, ripped his alma mater after the school fired all Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) positions and administrative appointments.
The university made its decision to comply with Florida law.
The Florida Board of Governors passed a regulation in January that limited public funding for DEI, defining them as ""any program, campus activity, or policy that classifies individuals on the basis of race, color, sex, national origin, gender identity, or sexual orientation and promotes differential or preferential treatment of individuals on the basis of such classification.""
The Independent Florida Alligator, a campus newspaper, said 13 full-time diversity, equity and inclusion positions were dismissed and 15 administrative appointments were eliminated.

Smith, on Sunday, slammed the university in a lengthy statement.
""I’m utterly disgusted by UF’s decision and the precedent that it sets,"" Smith said. ""Without the DEI department, the job falls to the Office of the Provost, who already has their hands full, to raise money for the university and continue to advance the academic studies in athletic programs.
""We cannot continue to believe and trust that a team of leaders all made up of the same background will make the right decision when it comes to equality and diversity. History has already proven that is not the case.""
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has made halting DEI a cornerstone of his efforts to overhaul education in the state, wrote on X, ""Florida is where DEI goes to die.""

DEI campus proponents argue they help correct systemic inequities and address increasingly diverse student populations, while its foes like DeSantis have said they are a form of leftist discrimination.
""We need diverse thinking and backgrounds to enhance our University and the DEI department is necessary to accomplish those goals,"" Smith continued.
""Instead of showing courage and leadership, we continue to fail based on systemic issues with this decision, UF has conformed to the political pressures of today’s time.
""To the MANY minority athletes at UF, please be aware and vocal about this decision by the University who is now closing the doors on other minorities without any oversight.

Tim Tebow opened up Sunday about his effort to help victims of child trafficking and exploitation in the United States and around the world.
The former NFL quarterback appeared on Fox News Channel’s ""Fox News Sunday"" with host Shannon Bream to talk about the world through the Tim Tebow Foundation and other agencies to combat what he called ""one of the worst evils in the world.""

""I was made aware of this several years ago, just the depth of it by one of our team members,"" Tebow said. ""She said to me, ‘I believe there is 20,000 boys and girls that are still unidentified.’
""So, law enforcement can see their abuse and rape images but they haven’t been able to identify them. So, if you can’t identify them, how could you possibly get to them?""
It led to partnerships with Homeland Security, Interpol and Europol, among law enforcement agencies, along with other companies and countries.
""We found that it’s not 20,000 kids that are unknown or unidentified, it’s over 50,000 boys and girls through the backlog that are unidentified in these global databases,"" he added. ""There are so many boys and girls and 65% of them are under the age of 12 and 4.3% of them – that’s 2,100 – are infants.""

Tebow’s foundation works with law enforcement in hopes of bringing the abusers to justice. He said one of the appeals he and his group were making on Capitol Hill earlier in the week was to bring more funding to his effort and bring in more victim identification specialists.
Tebow and the foundation worked with Homeland Security Investigations on ""Operation Renewed Hope"" – a three-week ""surge"" of investigations into child abuse in 2023. The foundation said it located ""311 probable identifications of previously unknown victims, including 14 positive contacts and confirmed the rescue of several victims from active abuse.""

Major League Baseball's new jerseys are not getting a warm welcome.

While some players have given mixed reviews on the jerseys, highlighting that they do feel better, fans have ripped Nike for their looks.

Pitchers Rich Hill and Miles Mikolas said they look ""cheap,"" as the last names on the back, and numbers on the front, are noticeably smaller. There also have been viral photos of tucked-in jerseys very visible through new pants.
MLB senior vice president of global consumer products Denis Nolan maintained, though, that the uniforms are top-notch.
""In acquiring Majestic and its MLB uniform manufacturing facilities in Easton, PA -- which have been making player uniforms for nearly two decades -- Fanatics has consistently produced world-class uniforms, including every Nike-branded MLB on-field jersey and all City Connect gear since 2020,"" Nolan said, via MLB.com.
Another global consumer exec, Stephen Roche, said that the jerseys' respective color schemes match up 100% for the first time.
""That was all part of the tightening up of the entire process,"" Roche said. ""Clubs were able to approve how everything matched Nike’s standard colors. For the first time, we had a uniform where all the colors matched exactly with the hats and the on-field colors. They had always been close, but they weren’t exact. Now they are.""

The league site notes that this year's jerseys have 25% more stretch compared to last year's. The league tested the uniforms on hundreds of players, debuting them in last year's All-Star Game to favorable reviews. Fanatics actually measured every player last year, and Nike body-scanned over 300 players to get the ideal fit.
""It was a very technological approach to outfitting players,"" Roche said. ""Everything was performance-driven.""

"March 8, 2024 6:50am EST","Ex-MLB star Adam Wainwright to make Grand Ole Opry debut, releases new single",Fox News,"Former St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright will play the Grand Ole Opry on Saturday. He released a new song called ""Hey Y'all"" on Friday.
Adam Wainwright is most known for his prowess on the pitcher’s mound.
He was a three-time All-Star and World Series champion with the St. Louis Cardinals at the height of his career. He retired from the majors following the 2023 season with 200 wins, more than 2,000 strikeouts and an ERA of 3.53.
Instead of preparing for spring training like he normally would this time of year, Wainwright is preparing to make his Grand Ole Opry debut Saturday in Nashville.
""I’m super excited. Can’t wait. I’ve been dreaming of this moment for a long time, and, honestly, I never thought it would happen to me,"" Wainwright told Fox News Digital. ""Just have lots of really great friends in the country music world, and those guys are so talented. And it’s just so fun watching their performance.

""I just never thought that I would be worthy of a great invitation like that. I’m very excited. I want to make sure that I honor that with a great performance.""
Wainwright teamed up with Grammy Award-winning producer and songwriter Gary Baker to releas the single ""Time to Fly"" late last year. He said he felt an added boost of confidence from Baker and others when they expressed their belief Wainwright could potentially embark on a country music career.
He explained that all he wanted to do in life was to be a Major League Baseball pitcher, and as he started to play his guitar and sing more, he ""fell in love with it.""
""As a starting pitcher on the road, you go to all these little towns, especially in the minor leagues, when there’s not a whole lot to do,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""You take a guitar and it’s great. It’s great to fill the time in those hotel rooms when there’s nothing else going on.
""It’s a good habit too. It’s fun to learn, and it’s fun to be able to hold court at a campfire. And that’s how I originally got started. Just wanted to make my own songs and have cool things to do at a campfire. And as that grew … now we’re playing on the Grand Ole Opry stage. Very blessed.""

Wainwright released his new single ""Hey Y’all"" Friday as he takes his career from the campfire to streaming services.
He explained the song is about the good manners he picked up being from Brunswick, Georgia, and the cordial, good-hearted neighbors he interacted with in the South.
EX-MLB STAR ADAM WAINWRIGHT REVEALS FEELINGS ON PITCH CLOCK, UNIVERSAL DH AS STELLAR CAREER ENDS
""I was sitting on my couch one day with my wife, and we started talking about all the things that kind of when you grow up in the South that are kind of integral to your upbringing. Having good manners is so important. Since the time I was 4 years old or 3 years old, I can remember opening the door for the ladies and taking my hat off when I got to the table for dinner, asking for a blessing over the meal, never taking the Lord’s name in vain, saying, ‘Yes sir' and ‘Yes, ma’am.’ And those kinds of things.
""We were just talking about how we wanted to pass that down and in that process, as we see people in our hometown — most of the people that have been there as long as I have — we all know each other like the back of our hand. And when we see each other, we say, ‘Hey man, how’s your mom? How’s your daddy?’ And we started talking, and it’s like this song is writing itself.

""So, that song is all about just growing up in the South and the ideals that we want to pass on. But one thing you can always be sure of, and that’s the line in the song, we say, ‘Hey y’all.’ It’s just ingrained in our nature.""

He was one of five players the league disciplined, including Pelicans guard Jose Alvarado and Heat center Thomas Bryant, who each got three-game suspensions for leaving the bench during the altercation. Heat forward Nikola Jovic was also suspended one game for leaving the bench.
Butler and Pelicans forward Naji Marshall, who was also suspended one game, got into it on the court following a Zion Williamson layup that saw Heat forward Kevin Love wrap him up to the point where the former hit the deck. Butler and Marshall eventually had to be separated, but more was going on as Alvarado and Bryant started to fight near the scorer’s table.

However, it is all in the past now for Butler, who decided to poke some fun at the situation with a photoshopped Instagram post.

Butler went even further on his Instagram Stories, too, posting several songs related to jail, including Akon’s ""Locked Up"" and ""Jail"" by Kanye West.
Butler’s suspension will end after the Heat take on the Sacramento Kings on Monday night on the road.

In typical Lionel Messi fashion, the first goal off his foot in the 2024 MLS season came at a time when Inter Miami needed it most.
Playing their first road game against the LA Galaxy, Inter Miami was down 1-0 throughout the game as the referee signaled for extra time. Knowing something needed to go in the back of the net to at least force a draw, Messi got to work on the pitch.
He used his new teammate, Jordi Alba, the former Barcelona star who followed Messi to Miami last season, to help set up the chance in front of LA Galaxy's net.

It was a passing clinic that initially began with a turnover by Messi until he got the ball kicked right back to his left foot. He found Alba just outside the 18-yard box, and he dropped it right back for Messi.
Then, streaking closer to the net, Messi gave a beautiful touch pass to Alba that set up a cross to the middle. Alba, though, was not looking for anyone else other than Messi, who continued his run.

The crowd was raucous, and it was a star-studded affair in Los Angeles for the match.
A record crowd of 27,642 came to see Messi on Sunday and included celebrities like Halle Berry, Hilary Duff, Edward Norton and Lil Wayne, as well as fellow athletes Novak Djokovic, Puka Nacua, Candace Parker and Diana Taurasi.
Messi even walked out with Saint West, the son of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, before the game kicked off.
""Saints walking Messi out on the field tonight at the La Galaxy vs Inter Miami Game!!! He is living the absolute dream!"" Kardashian wrote on X with an accompanying video.

New Washington Commanders owner Josh Harris understands how important the No. 2 overall pick in this year’s NFL Draft is to his franchise, especially after he and his ownership group paid $6 billion to buy it.
Because of the importance of the pick, Harris is present in Indianapolis this week for the NFL Scouting Combine, where he’s reportedly sitting in on prospect interviews, specifically with quarterbacks, according to ESPN.
Harris has reportedly sat in on all six interviews the team has had with the top quarterback prospects in this draft, which points to where the Commanders want to go with that pick.
However, it has always been expected the Commanders would be taking one of the top quarterbacks in the draft when it’s their turn on the clock in Detroit, the host site of this year’s festivities.

Harris' role in the interviews is unusual compared to other NFL owners. Usually, a team’s GM and front office contingent travel to Lucas Oil Stadium to do combine evaluations. But Harris is clearly showing he wants to be hands-on, especially if it means his team is picking its next franchise quarterback.
That makes sense for Harris considering this pick will likely be the next face of the franchise — for better or worse.
WASHINGTON COMMANDERS STADIUM LONG KNOWN AS FEDEX FIELD WILL GO WITHOUT SPONSORSHIP
But Commanders fans have nightmares of a hands-on owner. Previous owner Dan Snyder, the man Harris bought the team from, was the same type of owner.
Former Washington head coach Jon Gruden admitted Snyder ""would come in off his yacht and make the pick"" in the draft.

Tyreek Hill's 2024 did not get off to an ideal start.
Days before his Miami Dolphins were eliminated from the playoffs, his house erupted in flames.
A massive fire broke out at the All-Pro's home, and Davie Fire Rescue later determined the fire was ""unintentional, accidental,"" sparked by a child playing with a lighter inside the home.

Firefighters extinguished the fire shortly after arriving to the mansion in Southwest Ranches, roughly 23 miles west of Fort Lauderdale.
One of his neighbors is rapper Rick Ross, and he obviously had a pretty good view of the situation. Ross, though, took to Instagram Live to film the ordeal.
""Lil bro gonna have to build a new crib, it’s all good tho,"" Ross said in the video, via the New York Post. ""Dropped 10 [million] on this one, ya heard me? You build another one you feel me? Live it up.""
""God is great it’s unfortunate the house caught on fire across the street, but I checked with the firefighters, there was no one that was injured,"" Ross said later. ""Everybody was out of the house, the fire is under control. God bless the homie, you already know.""

"March 12, 2024 3:51pm EDT","Patrick Queen to join Steelers, Ravens AFC North rival, on 3-year deal: report",Fox News,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Patrick Queen is used to hunting Pittsburgh Steelers. Now, he’s reportedly going to be playing for them.
Queen, the former Baltimore Ravens linebacker, agreed to terms on a three-year, $41 million deal in free agency to join the Steelers, according to ESPN.
So, Queen will have to tackle some of his former teammates as these AFC North rivals clash twice a year.

Queen was near the top of the free agency pool this offseason, with many regarding him as the best inside linebacker to be available for every team. And it’s been a grind for him to get to that point despite being taken in the first round by the Ravens in 2020.
Though his tackle numbers were high in his first two seasons, he wasn’t the best in coverage, allowing five total touchdowns in that category combined. He was also missing tackles in the open field, which is frowned upon for a first-round linebacker.
DERRICK HENRY, RAVENS AGREE TO 2-YEAR DEAL: REPORTS
But he got better in 2022, giving up no touchdowns and posting a career-low 83.1 quarterback rate against. Queen had 117 tackles, two interceptions and five sacks that season as well.
In 2023, Queen posted a career-high 133 tackles, 3.5 sacks, one interception and six passes defended for a Ravens defense that dominated virtually everyone they played on the way to earning the No. 1 seed in the AFC. He made second-team All-Pro and earned his way to the Pro Bowl, his first of his career.

But the Ravens didn’t pick up Queen’s fifth-year option before the 2023 campaign started, which meant he was always destined for free agency.
The Steelers, having seen him on the opposite sideline for four years, clearly see a perfect fit for him on their menacing defense. Queen should slot right in next to Cole Holcomb, while T.J. Watt and Alex Highsmith continue to wreak havoc at outside linebacker.
For the Ravens, Queen’s loss is big, but they have an immediate solution after drafting Trenton Simpson in the third round last season. Roquan Smith, who was brought in during the 2022 season, is also still under contract.

"February 25, 2024 11:45am EST","MLB All-Star Cody Bellinger doesn't get $200M asking price, settles with Cubs on 3-year deal: reports",Fox News,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Cody Bellinger is back with the Chicago Cubs, reportedly agreeing to a three-year deal with the club. However, it wasn’t at the price tag he was hoping for.
Bellinger, who had a revitalizing season in Chicago with a .307/.356/.525 slash line last year, reportedly signed for $80 million over the three seasons.
ESPN’s Jeff Passan reports the contract includes two opt-outs after each of the first two years. He’ll earn $30 million in those first two seasons and $20 million in the final year of the contract. Of course, that’s if he doesn’t opt out at any point.

Bellinger was reportedly looking for a $200 million contract, as he was coming off a solid season. Jesse Rogers of ESPN reported the Cubs not wanting to meet that price, though, and no other team seemed to do so either.
Therefore, Bellinger returns to a team he was clearly comfortable with last season, and if he wants to test the market again over the next two years, the Cubs are giving him the ability to do so.
MLB UNION RIPS DECISION TO SHORTEN PITCH CLOCK TIME, SAYS PLAYERS EXPRESSED CONCERNS
It’s not uncommon for a Scott Boras-led player to take a deal like this. Carlos Correa did it before the 2022 season when he signed his three-year, $105 million pact with the Minnesota Twins after no other long-term deal was on the table. He ended up opting out after his first season but returned to the Twins on a six-year deal worth $200 million.
Bellinger, who was named Comeback Player of the Year in 2023, is hoping for the same result if he can replicate his numbers this season. The previous two campaigns for the outfielder were a disaster following a shoulder injury that came during the COVID-shortened 2020 season where his Los Angeles Dodgers won the World Series.
He hit an abysmal .165 in 2021 over 95 games, and couldn’t get much going in 2022 either, slashing .210/.265/.389 with 19 homers and 68 RBI. He also struck out 150 times that season.
Bellinger cut his strikeout rate to 15.7% last season, down from 27.3%, and he cashed in 97 RBI, which is the highest mark he’s had since his 115-RBI All-Star season in 2019.

So, Bellinger made $5 million after opting out of his $25 million deal with the Cubs that was in place in his previous deal. But perhaps that major payday will come depending on how he performs for a team that remains patient on the free agent market that still includes left-hander Blake Snell, the reigning NL Cy Young Award winner, Matt Chapman and Jordan Montgomery, to name a few.

Philadelphia Phillies veteran starter Zack Wheeler didn’t wait until next year’s free agency period to cash in on a new contract.
Wheeler is staying in the City of Brotherly Love after inking a three-year deal worth $126 million, which kicks in during the 2025 season.
Wheeler is set to make $23.5 million for the 2024 campaign.

The 33-year-old, who pitched to a 3.61 ERA last season, explained why he took a short-term deal with the Phillies as he looks ahead to life after baseball.
""I do enjoy pitching and I want to be here,"" Wheeler said during a news conference on Monday at the Phillies’ spring home, BayCare Ballpark. ""I love competing. But I don’t want to play until I’m old-old. And I want to be around my family. But I’m definitely enjoying the moment here, enjoying every moment I take the mound. It’s special, and not everybody gets to do it. Not everybody gets to do it as long as I have. I’m grateful for that.""
Wheeler’s $42 million per year that he will earn starting next season is the largest contract extension in MLB history.
PHILLIES END LONG-STANDING $1 HOT DOG NIGHTS AFTER FANS THREW THEM ON FIELD LAST SEASON
Compared to other veteran pitchers in MLB, Wheeler’s price tag in 2025 is the third-highest average annual value for a pitcher, with Max Scherzer and Justin Verlander ahead of him. It is also the fourth-highest of any player in MLB, the top spot going to Los Angeles Dodgers Japanese superstar Shohei Ohtani after he signed a $700 million contract this offseason.

""We said, ‘Well, let’s establish right now he’s one of the best pitchers in baseball,'"" he explained. ""Is he first, second, third? We don’t have to get into that. But he’s one of the best. And the reality is, when you start not only talking about being one of the best pitchers, he’s one of the best big-game pitchers in the game of baseball. So, in the postseason, when he takes that ball, I can’t think of anybody that I would rather have to take the mound than Zack.""
Since he joined the Phillies in 2020, Wheeler has started 10 games and made a relief appearance in the 2023 NLCS against the Arizona Diamondbacks last year, owning a 2.42 ERA over those outings. The only time he’s struggled in the postseason was the 2020 World Series against the Houston Astros, where he had a 5.32 ERA over 10.1 innings in two starts.
Despite the Phillies’ loss to the D-Backs last season, Wheeler had a 1.84 ERA over 14.2 innings, giving up nine hits and three earned runs with 17 strikeouts to two walks.
In the regular season, Wheeler eats innings for the Phillies, which is great to preserve the bullpen. He had 192 innings last season, striking out 212 hitters to just 39 walks over 32 starts.
His only All-Star appearance also came in Philly in 2021, when he had a league-leading 213.1 innings over 32 starts, owning a 2.78 ERA with 247 strikeouts. He finished second in Cy Young voting that year, losing the award to Milwaukee Brewers starter Corbin Burnes.

"February 28, 2024 2:00am EST",Innovative AI-powered approach to sports handicapping continues push to reshape betting,Fox News,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Artificial intelligence has opened the door for a whole new experience for fans and spectators who decide to partake in the fast-changing world of sports betting.
Long gone are the days when someone interested in placing a wager is forced to travel to a Las Vegas casino or frantically search for a local bookmaker. As more and more states across the U.S. legalize sports gambling, the way sports are consumed is likely to drastically change.
Data from the American Gaming Association showed that Americans placed more than $23 billion in bets on Super Bowl LVIII, featuring the Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco 49ers. A considerable number of those bets even involved singer Taylor Swift. Other wagers focused on the coin toss or the length of the national anthem.

While prop bets for the Super Bowl are always popular, millions of sports fans handicap various sporting events throughout the year. Technology company Leans.AI operates a sports statistical analytics website and is at the forefront of leveraging AI in an effort to make something that is typically unpredictable into something more reliable.
Leans.AI created a ""genius"" platform called Remi to quickly and precisely analyze data from some of the most popular professional sports leagues in the nation, including the NFL, NBA, NHL and MLB.
WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?
Remi can also crunch the numbers for college football and basketball contests. The computer picks generated with the assistance of AI use specific win probabilities ""to find a few games each day that lean strongly to one side of a line or spread,"" according to the company's official website.
Remi then aggregates point spreads for a given sporting event.
""So what it does is it analyzes data on every single game and its thousands and thousands of data points… and it crunches all of those numbers into a single win probability for the game, and then we can convert that to a cover probability based on what betting lines are at the time. We generate an exact probability based on what the algorithm is telling us of exactly how likely it is for a team to cover a spread or not."" Steve Westfeld of Leans.AI told Fox News Digital.
Leans.AI provides precise data to subscribers who can then use the information as they choose. The provided content is for entertainment purposes only.
SPORTS BETTING IN GEORGIA SEES RENEWED SUPPORT AMID OPPOSITION
Fans can even take in a game when they are on the go. When that is coupled with the rising costs associated with supporting a team, people's desire to attend in-person games has been somewhat dampened. Now, more than ever, fans are looking for something that makes them feel as though they are participating in an event or situation that was tailored to them. Sports betting is no different, but AI-driven technology has started to bridge that gap by creating experiences that can feel highly personalized.
A more personalized experience also tends to create a more emotional connection to the game, which is something bettors often grapple with in their decision-making. Becoming overly emotional and being too attached to a particular team or game could impact someone's choice when they are making a sports wager. But, Remi is data-driven and unbiased, which creates a much more ideal environment for finding a precise probability.
""We are trying to predict true game analytics. So our algorithm is not looking at where the money is going or is not going on a game… it's not looking at what other emotional bettors are doing… it's not looking at what other emotional, biased handicappers are doing. It's looking strictly at data and the AI and algorithm has allowed us to take essentially human bias and emotion out of the equation entirely. When we do that, we can create a pretty precise probability on how the game is likely to trend.""

Access to television bundles, streaming, and 4k television technology has allowed the average fan to watch their favorite team or player from the comfort of their home, even if they do not live in a given team's home market.
Machine learning algorithms can also be leveraged to allow various sportsbooks to analyze a given bettor's patterns and interests to show them personalized recommendations. As a result, users are given a variety of new tools that they otherwise would not have without the technology.
""AI will allow for increasingly personal experiences for sports bettors, and customize quests for users, building upon the type of quests they tend to accept and complete,"" Dan Taren, founder of sports betting platform Scrimmage, told Boardroom.
""This is powerful for operators we integrate with to help their users make their betting experience feel personalized to them.""
So-called microbetting has experienced a rapid rise in recent years. It gives participants the ability to place wagers on outcomes as narrowly targeted as whether the next play will be a run or a pass, how many yards will it gain, or whether the drive results in a punt, a touchdown, a turnover or something else.
Microbetting ""is a must-have to be a competitor in this space,"" Matt Prevost, chief revenue officer for BetMGM said. Between 40% to 65% of all bets his company takes on football come after the opening kickoff.
Artificial intelligence is being used to power the personalization of popular sports betting apps to tailor experiences to users' preferences. (iStock)
Johnny Avello, director of race and sports for DraftKings, said his company is concentrating more on microbetting offerings this fall.
""We're going to have more markets like betting on the next play, who's going to carry the ball, how many yards it will gain,"" he said. ""We've found that those are equally as popular as who's going to win the game or the total amount scored.""
When enjoyed in moderation and when spending limits are put in place, sports wagering gambling can be a fun and exciting way to enjoy a game. However, it is important that players are aware of the importance of responsible gambling.
Bill Miller, president and CEO of the American Gaming Association, shared that a responsible gambler does not rely on gambling as a source of income.

""As someone approaches the Super Bowl or March Madness or any other sporting event where they're thinking about making the game a little bit more fun or a little bit more interesting, one, it's supposed to be fun. No one should ever believe they are going to make a living or a second job placing wagers on sporting events,"" Miller told Fox News Digital last February.
Gamblers should also have a specific budget in mind.
""And number two, you set a budget, and you stick to that budget,"" he advised.

All eyes have been on Indianapolis this week, as the Colts home stadium once again serves as the host for the NFL scouting combine.
The gauntlet drill, which requires participants to catch a series of passes before sprinting up the sideline, is normally one of the week's most anticipated activities. Former Colorado State tight end Dallin Holker turned heads on Friday when he made an impressive one-handed catch during the drill.
Holker began to head up the field after he made what he likely thought was the final catch in the sequence, but he quickly realized that another pass was heading his direction. Holker then looked back and grabbed the ball with one hand, while he carried a football in his other hand.

Dropped passes tend to be a normal occurrence during the drill, which makes Holker's display of athleticism even more impressive.
""Never seen this one before,"" the NFL wrote in a social media post that included a video of Holker's catch.
While former Georgia Bulldogs star Brock Bowers is widely expected to be the first tight end to hear his name called at next month's NFL Draft, Holker's draft stock could certainly be on the rise.
TEXAS' XAVIER WORTHY BREAKS 40-YARD DASH RECORD AT NFL COMBINE
Playing for winless Napa High School as a sophomore, Bowers was lightly recruited. He had only one FBS scholarship offer, Nevada, before one of his coaches fought hard for him to be included at a Nike camp. There, he was so good, the offers started pouring in, including one from Notre Dame to play linebacker.
Eventually, the Fighting Irish changed course and asked Bowers to play tight end. The problem for Notre Dame was that Bowers dreamed of playing football in the South and took advantage of his opportunity in 2021 when Darnell Washington was injured.
A year later, Bowers beat out Notre Dame star Michael Mayer for the John Mackey Award as the nation’s best tight end and last season, despite his own battle with an ankle injury, he repeated as the Mackey Award winner.

Former Texas Longhorns star Ja’Tavion Sanders and former Ohio State Buckeyes standout Cade Stover are also considered top tight end prospects entering this year's draft.
Stover plays the tight end position with the intensity of a linebacker.
""They’ve asked if I’m capable of helping defensively and there’s no doubt about it, I can help wherever you want me to help,"" Stover said Thursday. ""I love playing tight end, but then again I’m there to do whatever we need to win a ballgame.""

"March 13, 2024 11:03am EDT",Record-setting Iditarod win overshadowed by death of 3 dogs,Fox News,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Alaska's annual Iditarod dog sled race ended with a victory for the ages: One of the biggest names in the sport came from behind after a moose attack to win the grueling, dayslong contest for an unprecedented sixth time.
But Dallas Seavey's record-setting win late Tuesday was overshadowed by the deaths of three dogs in this year's storied endurance race across the Alaska wilderness, and renewed calls from an animal rights group to stop the race. A fourth dog, one of Seavey's, was severely injured by a moose on the trail.
Seavey, 37, finished the 51st Iditarod in 9 days, 2 hours, 16 minutes and 8 seconds and won just over $55,000 for first place. As he neared the finish line, he jumped off his sled and ran with his dogs, pumping his fists. After he reached the finish line, he hugged each dog on his team — and they gave him sloppy dog kisses as they sat on the winner's podium.
PETA CALLS FOR END OF ALASKA'S IDITAROD RACE FOLLOWING DEATH OF 2 DOGS
""This one was supposed to be hard,"" Seavey told the crowd. ""It had to be special, it had to be more than just a normal Iditarod, and for me, it was.""
The Iditarod Trail Dog Sled Race takes human-and-dog teams across 1,000 miles (1,609 kilometers) of wilderness on a trail that traverses two mountain ranges, the Yukon River and a slice of the frozen Bering Sea before ending in the Gold Rush town of Nome just south of the Arctic Circle.
But the deaths of the dogs on three separate teams, two led by rookie mushers and a third in his second Iditarod, cast a pall over the race as the Iditarod ended a five-year streak without a dog death. Five dogs also died and eight were injured in collisions with snow machines during training before the race on shared-use trails.
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, the loudest critic of the Iditarod, called for officials to end the contest once and for all.
""The Iditarod is the shame of Alaska,"" PETA Executive Vice President Tracy Reiman said in a statement. ""How many more dogs need to die before this stops? Dogs’ lives are worth more than this.""
The Iditarod did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Mushers Issac Teaford, of Salt Lake City, and Hunter Keefe, of Knik, both voluntarily quit the course after their dogs died, or they would have risked being removed by the race marshal, per Iditarod rules.
The third dog on rookie Calvin Daugherty’s team collapsed on the trail about 10 miles (16 kilometers) before reaching the checkpoint in the village of Shaktoolik. A necropsy is planned, and Daugherty also scratched.
A moose severely injured one of Seavey's dogs in an attack on the trail early on. Seavey shot and killed the moose with a handgun and gutted it. Race rules require any big game animal killed in defense of life or property to be gutted before the musher moves on. But because he spent only 10 minutes gutting the moose, race officials gave Seavey a two-hour time penalty.
Seavey and his team battled back, and by Tuesday morning they had a three-hour lead over their nearest competitor before sweeping to victory later in the day.
""When you look back at 1,000 miles of what these dogs just covered, the challenges they faced, you can’t swallow that in one bite, but we can have one good step at a time,"" he said of his dogs. ""And if you can keep doing that, it leads to something.""
Seavey’s name is found throughout the Iditarod record book. In 2005, he became the youngest musher to run in the race, and in 2012, its youngest champion.

Seavey also won Iditarod championships in 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2021. He had previously been tied with now-retired musher Rick Swenson with five titles apiece. Swenson won the Iditarod in 1977, 1979, 1981, 1982 and 1991.
Seavey’s family history is deeply entwined with the Iditarod. His grandfather, Dan Seavey, helped organize and ran the first Iditarod in 1973, and his father, Mitch Seavey, is a three-time champion.
Dallas Seavey almost took a different path in the sports world. He was the first Alaskan to win a USA national wrestling championship when he took the 125-pound Gregco-Roman title in 2003 and trained for a year at the U.S. Olympic Training Center before concussions led him to back to mushing.
The Iditarod started March 2 for 38 mushers with a ceremonial run in Anchorage, followed by the competitive start on March 3 in Willow, about 75 miles north of Anchorage. Seven mushers dropped out of the race this year.

""Pro life means protecting Life. People who are using IVF are trying to create life,"" Pearl wrote on X. ""This makes no sense. I'm confident Alabama lawmakers will fix this glitch ASAP as hundreds of couples are in the middle of the process!""
The Alabama Supreme Court earlier in the week ruled that frozen embryos can be considered children under state law, a decision critics said could have sweeping implications for fertility treatment in the state. The decision was issued in a pair of wrongful death cases brought by three couples who had frozen embryos destroyed in an accident at a fertility clinic.
The plaintiffs in the Alabama case had undergone IVF treatments that led to the creation of several embryos, some of which were implanted and resulted in healthy births.

The couples had paid to keep others frozen in a storage facility at the Mobile Infirmary Medical Center.
In response to the court's ruling, the largest hospital system in Alabama — the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) — announced on Wednesday that it would be suspending its in-vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments.
""The UAB Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility has paused in-vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments as it evaluates the Alabama Supreme Court’s decision that a cryopreserved embryo is a human being,"" the hospital said in a statement provided to Fox News Digital on Thursday.

Nike had long been accused of using sweatshops in Asia to produce the gear it sells across the globe. The company released a statement for fiscal year 2023 about forced labor, human trafficking and modern slavery.
""NIKE takes seriously and fully supports national and international efforts to end forced labor, human trafficking and modern slavery,"" Nike’s statement read. ""NIKE’s requirements for suppliers are contained in our Code of Conduct and Code Leadership Standards.

The Elimination Chamber match is one of the most grueling the WWE has to offer.
The monstrous chain-linked structure weighs 10 tons and contains two miles of chain and goes over the entire ring area. Two competitors begin in the ring with four others inside pods in each corner of the facility. Every 5 minutes, a new competitor enters the ring. The match is single elimination and the last one standing is the winner.

Randy Orton will be one of six wrestlers competing for a shot at Seth Rollins’ World Heavyweight Championship. He’s up against Drew McIntyre, Bobby Lashley, LA Knight, Kevin Owens and Logan Paul.
When Orton gets into the Chamber this weekend, it will be the ninth time in his career. It will be the most in WWE history. He shared some insight on what being in the match is actually like.
""It’s a very unforgiving structure to say the least,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""I mean, there’s no give. They’ve made a couple alterations over the years, but … putting some stiff a-- mats here and there or coating the bolts on the side of the ring, I mean, they’re still going to cut through skin. Like the chain is still chain-link that don’t give. When your face is getting smashed against it, it hurts.""

Orton added that being in the pod and waiting for your time in the ring isn’t exactly a walk in the park either.
""I’ll tell you what, too, if you’re claustrophobic, being stuck in that pod ain’t no fun either,"" he said. ""It used to be chain-link in those four pods, and now they’ve made it so it’s like a fish tank with Plexiglas, and we’re going to Australia where it’s like 100 degrees right now. It’s a grueling match.
""When I hear, ‘Oh, you’re in the Elimination Chamber match' or 'I qualify for the Elimination Chamber,’ like, I’m not exactly happy about it. I’ve got the most potential to hurt, destroy my body in that match, more so than any other match that WWE has. It’s a rough night.

New Atlanta Falcons head coach Raheem Morris was straightforward when discussing his quarterback situation heading into the 2024 season.
""If we had better quarterback play, I may not be standing here at the podium,"" Morris said at the NFL Scouting Combine Tuesday.
The Falcons finished 7-10 in a mediocre NFC South last season, and head coach Arthur Smith shifted between Desmond Ridder and Taylor Heinicke throughout the campaign.

Falcons fans were desperate for one of those quarterbacks to thrive with solid offensive weapons around them, including Kyle Pitts, Drake London and Bijan Robinson, all first-round draft choices.
Ridder, a third-round draft pick in 2022, was graded the worst NFL starting quarterback (38th overall), per Pro Football Focus. Heinicke didn’t do much to win the job in the five games he played.
SUPER BOWL CHAMPION TIM MCKYER ARRESTED ON MULTIPLE HIT-AND-RUN CHARGES
Both quarterbacks are on the depth chart heading into 2024, but based on Morris’ comments, neither is the signal-caller he wishes to see in Week 1.
So, all options are on the table for Atlanta, which owns the eighth pick in the 2024 NFL Draft and has assets to make a trade.

Atlanta is expected to be in play for Justin Fields, the Bears’ first-round pick who could be on the move if GM Ryan Poles decides to start over with a rookie quarterback with the No. 1 overall selection.
The Falcons also have $32.8 million in projected salary cap space to bring in a free agent quarterback like veteran Kirk Cousins.

Russell stepped up when it mattered most, scoring 21 of his season-high 44 points in the fourth quarter and hit a go-ahead jumper with 5.9 seconds to play to lift the Lakers to a 123-122 victory over the Bucks.
NETS' BEN SIMMONS OUT REMAINDER OF SEASON WITH INJURY, SEARCHING FOR TREATMENT OPTIONS TO SOLVE BACK ISSUES
Russell's clutch performance was particularly important as four-time NBA champion LeBron James sat out of the game to rest his sore left ankle. James hobbled off the court with four minutes left in the Lakers’ loss to Sacramento on Wednesday night with the latest flare-up of an ankle injury that has bothered the leading scorer in NBA history throughout his 21st season.
After the game, Russell took a moment to reflect on some of the up-and-downs he has faced during his professional basketball career.

The 28-year-old suggested that ""public humiliation"" simply makes him better.
""With my craft and my talent on the floor, I’ve always felt like I was capable of doing things. Getting hot makes it a little more exciting throughout a game,"" Russell said via the Los Angeles Times. ""Off the floor, obviously, you know what I’ve been through. Public humiliation has done nothing but molded me into the killer that y’all see today. And, um, I never lack confidence. I never fear confrontation. I want all the smoke.""

Russell is averaging 18.1 points per game, along with 6.2 assists per contest this season.
""D-Lo just stepped up and won us the game, and obviously with Spence with the defense on that last possession,"" Russell's teammate Austin Reaves said. ""Just seeing D-Lo take over the game, I constantly kept telling him in timeouts, ‘Take us home.’""

Russell's name was linked to multiple trade rumors ahead of last month's NBA trade deadline. The Lakers ultimately decided to retain the point guard, and it appears that decision is paying off.

Paige Spiranac, one of the biggest golf influencers in the sport, came to the defense of Charlie Woods on Thursday after the 15-year-old missed out on qualifying for a PGA Tour event.
Tiger Woods’ son participated in a pre-qualifier for the Cognizant Classic. He shot an 86 and finished 110th among 112 competitors at Lost Lake Golf Club in Hobe Sound, Florida.

While expectations are high for the son of one of the greatest golfers to ever play the sport, Spiranac encouraged fans of the sport to tamp down on trying to build up Charlie Woods and just let him play his game.
""How about we let Charlie Woods develop his game without constant media coverage,"" she wrote in a post on X. ""Golf is mentally challenging enough without all the added eyeballs on him and pressure.""
Charlie Woods has participated with his father in two-some events like the PNC Championship, but trying to qualify for a PGA Tour event is an entirely different beast, especially for a kid of high school age.

He played with Olin Browne Jr., who qualified for the U.S. Open last summer in Los Angeles. Browne, the son of a three-time PGA Tour winner, shot a 72.
Woods has a lot to live up to and being in the social media age probably does not help a bit either. His father was 16 and had won the first of three straight U.S. Junior Amateur titles when he received a sponsor exemption to play his first PGA Tour event – the Nissan Open at Riviera.

"February 22, 2024 6:30am EST","Enhanced Games founder says steroid-approved event is ‘the future of sports,’ calls out hypocrisy of Olympics",Fox News,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
The Enhanced Games are set to debut in 2025, and since its inception, they've been dubbed the ""Olympics on Steroids"" – and that's because performance-enhancing drugs will be 100% allowed.
Dr. Aron D'Souza founded the event last year, and the immediate backlash has been strong. He has been told his idea is unsafe, unfair and a mockery of the real Olympics, but disagrees with those assessments.
In fact, D'Souza calls his Enhanced Games ""the future of sports"" because his event epitomizes the safety and fairness of sports, not sports as we know them today.
Steroids, obviously, have the stigma of not being safe. So, allowing steroids is simply unsafe, right? Wrong, says D'Souza.
He says safety is actually his No. 1 priority for this event.
""Ultimately, we have one shot to do this right, and if that has any health complications whatsoever, it would not only derail the company and movement we’re creating, but also the social change that we’re attempting to create here,"" D'Souza said in a recent interview with Fox News Digital. ""Ultimately, what we are doing is heavily destigmatizing performance enhancements and I think unlocking the field of performance medicine, which leads to longevity and anti-aging technologies, and the giant publicity storm that we’ve gone through, there’s so much attention, we know the world’s eyes are on us – we know we have to do this right. We know the expectations are very, very high, and there’s a great prize well beyond the future of the Olympics if we do it right, so we have to do it right.""

D'Souza also says he has plenty of medical professionals on hand, and athletes will go through rigorous testing before they can compete.
And, says D'Souza, there are a lot more people to whom sports fans should be issuing their safety concerns, particularly his own competition in the IOC.
""For the people who say this is unsafe or unhealthy, I’d tell them that the two longest-serving sponsors of the Olympics are Coca-Cola and McDonald’s, the two organizations that have done the most damage to health in human history,"" he said. ""There’s actually no doubt about that.
""Fast food and fake sugar have done more damage to human health than anyone in human history. You can read the history books. The rise of McDonald’s and the rise of Coca-Cola have been very much attached to the Olympic movement. So, when the IOC and its cronies want to lecture me about safety, I point to their own history.""
But convincing the public that the event is safe is half the battle. That fraction actually may be generous.
Those who take steroids, in just about every sport, are punished. Olympic athletes are stripped of their medals, and professional athletes are stripped of salaries and games via suspension. So, how could an event full of steroid users be fair? Well, that's actually what would make it fair because everyone is honest about what they are doing, which is far from the case in the Olympics, says D'Souza.
Recent studies – highlighted on the Enhanced Games' website, which D'Souza says is the Olympics' ""own research"" – have shown that roughly half of Olympic athletes actually use performance-enhancing drugs but only around 1% of them get caught.
D'Souza even noted a study that says around 60% of swimmers claim to be asthmatic yet only 2% of the world's population actually is. That way, swimmers could use ""high-powered steroid inhalers.""

With those notes, D'Souza asks how the Olympics are fair if the Olympics knows about the supposed dishonesty of their own athletes, yet he says his event gets mocked for being unfair despite being 100% truthful.
""The Olympics claims to be natural. They claim to be the personification of natural sport, and the drug-testing regime is so ineffective for a variety of structural and democratic reasons that the Olympics can never be natural,"" D'Souza said. ""So, what we are doing will actually make the Olympics cleaner. It will make the Olympics more natural, and it will create a more fair and level group of playing field.""
""If you’re an athlete who uses performance enhancements, you can come over to our side, you can have a career on our side, you can be open and you can be honest about it, and you can make good money. If you want to be natural, go complete at the Olympics. But you know what? The Olympics should be all natural – get rid of the supersuits in the swimming. Get rid of the shoes in track and field. Be truly natural like ancient Greece and go back to your roots.
""The Olympics are the ultimate form of human competition. It’s so wonderful to see athletes compete at the highest level and see who’s the best. But you know what? The Olympics themselves have never had competition, and we are creating that competition. That creates for a healthier and better environment for the athletes and the taxpayers.""
On top of that, there are numerous performance-enhancements, like testosterone and human growth hormone, that are actually legal to use recreationally but banned by the Olympics and other sports leagues.
""And that’s where the real opportunity is, is to take something that’s done in the dark alley, destigmatize it, bring high-quality clinical supervision and make it open and honest,"" D'Souza said.
""Doesn’t everyone have the right to be strong?""

D'Souza has had several wealthy investors, including PayPal founder Peter Thiel, invest in the games so that way he can pay his athletes, which is something the Olympics does not do in their high-powered ""corruption train,"" as D'Souza calls it.
The chance at prize money is working, he said.
James Magnussen, an Australian swimmer who won eight golds at the World Championships, Pan Pacific Championships and Commonwealth Games will compete and win $1 million if he can break the 50-meter freestyle world record (it would not be officially recognized due to his taking of PEDs). D'Souza said it would take about a year to get an athlete of that caliber, but ""it took, like, four days.""

In his efforts to prevent the public from thinking his event is unsafe and unfair, he's started a lot of conversation, and that alone is a success.
""My theory of social change is very simple: Until someone puts a suit on and goes to work every day trying to solve a problem, it will not get solved. So, no one had ever tried to destigmatize performance enhancements. No one had ever tried to build a new Olympics. And it’s so gratifying that, after just a few tweets, we’ve really captivated the global public imagination. Now, we have every venture capital fund, it seems, breathing down our necks to invest more into this deal, so we can have not just millions but tens of millions and soon to be hundreds of millions of dollars to build the future of sports.
""I will be very proud if I can, if anything, force the Olympics to pay their athletes, create a more fair and equitable playing field in sports, and that conversation’s already starting.""

Buffalo Bills star quarterback Josh Allen may not say it out loud, but his left tackle Dion Dawkins will say it for him: He’s in love.
Dawkins, who signed a multi-year extension to remain Allen’s blindside protector in Buffalo, made an appearance on ""Up & Adams"" with Kay Adams and guest, former Tennessee Titans left tackle Taylor Lewan, on Tuesday, where he discussed the infamous Paris moment where Allen split his pants.
Within his explanation for it, Dawkins dropped what he feels his teammate is going through right now.

""I think it’s moreso Josh is in like a new realm of clothing,"" Dawkins said regarding what Allen was wearing in Paris last week. ""I think he has this new girl, and his new girl is opening his horizons to different types of clothing that he’s not used to.
""So Josh might be the Lululemon guy, or one of those stretchy pants guys, so every day it’s stretchy. Now, he’s getting in some clean cut, stitched stuff, and now when you’re stitched a little bit, you’re gonna pop through that jawn.""
BILLS' JOSH ALLEN BLAMES RIPPED PANTS FOR MAD DASH FROM GIRLFRIEND HAILEE STEINFELD'S SIDE IN PARIS
Adams added some context of her own, saying she had a conversation with Allen at the Super Bowl in Las Vegas, where the Pro Bowl signal caller said, ""You think I dress myself?"" after getting a compliment on his outfit.
""You know your quarterback, man,"" Dawkins responded. ""I know Josh, and Josh is not a product of his environment. Josh is in love. Josh is in love, so if his girl is shopping, and she’s like, ‘Josh, try these on,’ Josh is going to say, ‘All right, I’ll try these on.’""

Allen caught some heat when video initially showed him rushing ahead of Steinfeld in Paris, though no one knew that he was having a wardrobe malfunction at the time. He had a jacket tied around his waist.
""My pants ripped at dinner,"" he wrote in an X post. ""Didn’t want cheeks out…I love Paris.""
Allen and Steinfeld, an actress and singer, have been connected since May 2023. However, their relationship has not been publicly confirmed by either of them, making Dawkins’ ""love"" comment very interesting.

Former Duke men’s basketball star Jay Williams reiterated his hot take that Iowa Hawkeyes sharpshooter Caitlin Clark isn't ""great"" just yet because she hasn’t won an NCAA championship.
Williams doubled down on Wednesday as he called the LSU-Kentucky game on ESPN. The college basketball analyst had a segment with LSU women’s basketball star Angel Reese and was given a second chance to clarify what he said about Clark last week.

""We were talking about ‘greatest,’ and in my interview we talked about GOATs,"" Williams said. ""For me, I’m like, you wanna be a GOAT? Fine. There’s levels of greatness. You gotta win championships to be GOATs.
""So when people want to don her as the greatest of (all time), I’m like, ‘Let’s slow down.’ I’ve seen Diana Taurasi. I’ve seen Breanna Stewart. And you can sit there and tell me all day long, ‘Well, she’s played with other great players.’ OK, great. Championships — that’s how we measure greatness overall.""
Williams maintained that he still believes Clark is a ""prolific"" scorer and has some of the best range the game has seen.

Clark’s résumé speaks for itself — she was the AP Player of the Year last year, won the John Wooden Award, and is well on her way to becoming a three-time First-Team All-American.
Not only has Clark become the all-time leading scorer in Division 1 women’s basketball history, she could potentially pass LSU legend Pete Maravich as the all-time of Division 1 basketball.
Clark led Iowa to a national championship appearance only to fall to Reese’s Tigers. For what it’s worth, Kelsey Plum, Kelsey Mitchell and Jackie Stiles, who are Nos. 2-4 behind Clark, never won a title or made a national championship appearance.

Dani Alves, a Brazilian soccer star who won the gold medal at the 2020 Olympics for his country, was found guilty of raping a woman in Barcelona, Spain, and sentenced to four years and six months in prison.
A three-judge panel at the Barcelona Provincial Court convicted the 40-year-old for the Dec. 31, 2022 incident. He was also ordered to pay the equivalent of $162,000 as compensation for the victim and was banned from approaching the victim’s home or place of work and communicating with her for nine years.

Alves’ lawyer, Inés Guardiola, said she would appeal the verdict.
The former Brazil and Barcelona defender was accused of raping the victim in the bathroom of a Barcelona nightclub. The court considered it proof that the victim did not consent to sex and there was evidence, in addition to the defendant’s testimony, that she was raped.
""I am not that kind of man,"" Alves testified during his trial.
The victim told state prosecutors she danced with the former soccer star and willingly entered the bathroom. However, when she wanted to leave, she said Alves would not let her. She said Alves slapped her, insulted her and forced her to have sexual relations against her will.

The victim’s attorney sought 12 years in prison for Alves. The soccer player’s lawyer wanted his acquittal or, if he is found guilty, a one-year sentence plus $54,000 in compensation for the victim. The state sought a nine-year sentence.
Alves has been in jail since being detained on Jan. 20, 2023. His request for bail was denied because he was considered a flight risk. Brazil does not extradite its own citizens when they are sentenced in other countries.
Alves was playing soccer in Mexico when he was arrested. The club terminated his contract immediately.

Jim Thome is off social media, so it's a bit difficult to get him on the airwaves.
Well, folks at ESPN Cleveland had a little wager for an intern to get the Hall of Famer on their radio station.
The intern, named Nick, was challenged to book Thome on ""The Really Big Show"" on the station. If he were successful, the college student would win $100.

Nick went to work, but apparently he crossed the line.
Again, with Thome off social media, Nick turned to Thome's wife, Andrea, and the couple's high-school son.
Nick tagged both Andrea and the son in numerous posts and sent Thome's wife numerous requests to get Jim on.
The show's listeners added in on what they considered to be the fun. However, it was anything but for Andrea Thome.
""I am all about kindness and connection, but this is my personal account—not a vehicle for booking my husband on talk radio shows,"" she wrote on X, formerly Twitter. ""Please don’t berate me for that, and please don’t tag our children in those endeavors, either. He has an agent for a reason.

""I did not have grown men on @ESPNCleveland bullying me on International Women’s Day because I won’t interrupt my husband while he is working across the country to call in so your intern can win $100. How about I Venmo the kid and you guys back off?""
The Thomes made headlines earlier this week, when a Barstool Sports host was tasked to name the top-10 home run hitters in MLB history and couldn't leave the office until he had done so. He named Thome, who ranks eighth all-time, 36 hours later, even with Andrea calling into the show to drop some hints.
""I called in the other day for the first time ever to offer clues when Jim couldn’t because he was working one of his three jobs,"" Andrea said in another post. ""Now, I’m bound to engage with every copycat that tries these stunts to get him on talk shows? Come on. I guess it’s a good day to thin the herd.""

Braylon Edwards, the Michigan Wolverines football legend who ended up going third overall in the 2005 NFL Draft, came to an elderly man’s rescue during a locker room assault.
The incident occurred in Farmington Hills, Michigan, where Edwards saw an 80-year-old man being assaulted by a 25-year-old man at the Farmington Family YMCA on March 1, according to WDIV-TV.
Edwards explained the scenario, one where he was quick to jump into action.

""I walk into the locker room after work, and basically, I hear about four rows behind me arguing about music and how it was being played too loud,"" Edwards explained. ""So, I’m not paying attention, and I was just minding my business.
""The noise escalates, and then you can hear some pushing and shoving, so you know what fighting sounds like, but once I hear a thud, that’s when I got up and turned around.""

Officials told WDIV-TV that the 25-year-old male beat the 80-year-old before Edwards entered the situation.
""I see the guy for what I was thinking was reaching for a phone underneath the victim, grabs the back of the victim’s head by the hair, and he was about to slam it down on the counter,"" Edwards said.
""I didn’t know it was that serious. I mean, the victim probably had a serious concussion by nature, but it wasn’t until I talked to the detective, Jacobs down in Farmington, who told me that if I didn’t step in, but at the end of the day that’s what you do.""

The assailant fled the YMCA on foot but was eventually arrested by authorities. ClickOnDetroit says he remains in custody after his arrest.
Edwards, an All-American and 2004 Big Ten Offensive Player of the Year, still owns the Wolverines receiving yards record with 3,613 over his four-year career. His senior season saw him catch 15 of his 39 career touchdowns and tally 1,391 receiving yards – a career-high.
Edwards was eventually taken third overall by the Cleveland Browns, where he’d play five seasons, racking up 3,697 yards and 28 touchdowns.
He had one 1,000-yard season in his career, though, coming in 2007 with 1,289 yards, which earned him his only Pro Bowl as well. Edwards went on to play for the New York Jets for three seasons as well as the San Francisco 49ers and Seattle Seahawks for one year.

The New York Yankees’ hopes of winning a World Series in 2024 took a huge hit Wednesday as Gerrit Cole is reportedly set to miss the first handful of games of the season.
Cole, the reigning American League Cy Young Award winner, underwent an MRI on his right elbow earlier in the week after he experienced issues recovering from spring training starts.

While the Yankees haven’t announced whether Cole has suffered a devastating injury that would derail his season, the New York Post reported that surgeon Dr. Neal ElAttrache expressed enough concern in Cole’s ulnar collateral ligament that it will require him to visit the doctor in Los Angeles. A torn UCL would mean Tommy John surgery and the end of Cole's season before it even began.
ElAttrache recommended more tests with Cole, according to the New York Post. Cole will reportedly be out an ""extended period"" of time while the elbow rests.
It’s not exactly what Yankees fans want to hear in what feels like a dire year for New York.

Cole led the AL with a 2.63 ERA in 33 starts. He pitched in 209 innings and had 222 strikeouts. He was an All-Star for the fifth time in six seasons – sans the pandemic season. He was the Yankees’ best pitcher by a mile as the rest of the rotation had ERAs above 4.00.
On Monday, Yankees manager Aaron Boone said Cole reported feeling a higher level of fatigue than usual between spring training starts.
""He described it as his recovery, leading into his next start, has been more akin to what he feels in the season when he’s making 100 pitches,"" Boone said. ""He usually doesn’t have the recovery issues he’s having. It’s been more of a challenge, more taxing. So we’re going to get an MRI to see what we’re dealing with here.""

Holtz, who spoke at the 2020 Republican National Convention, was given the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Trump in 2020, shortly after Biden defeated him in the election.
""It’s the highest honor or award you could possibly receive, and I receive it with mixed emotions. First of all, I’m humbled,"" Holtz told Fox & Friends afterward. ""There are many more people far worthy than me I can assure you. Nobody is more appreciative than me. So, I’m excited to have this opportunity and at the same time, I’m excited to receive it from President Trump. The president I admire and respect. I think he did a tremendous job.""

Legendary heavyweight boxer, Mike Tyson, is slated to make his highly anticipated return to the ring later this year.
The July 20 bout against YouTube star-turned-boxer Jake Paul, inside AT&T Stadium in suburban Dallas, will mark Tyson's first fight in almost four years.
While reaction to the fight varied greatly, former Pittsburgh Steelers star-turned-boxer Le'Veon Bell believes the upcoming fight will end with a knockout.

Bell believes ""Iron Mike"" will have a strong showing early on but will eventually ""tire and get knocked out."" The former NFL runningback took to X to respond to a video of Robert Griffin III sparing with the 57-year-old Tyson.
Bell's premise seems to revolve primarily around the age gap between Tyson and Paul.

Several months ago, Bell appeared to challenge Paul to a fight and expressed confidence about defeating the social media star.
""I will stop him. I will stop Jake Paul,"" Bell said on the 'No Jumper"" podcast in August. ""It's hard to knock somebody out if they don't want to be knocked out. . . . he's not doing eight rounds with me. There's nobody in that influencer s--t that's making it eight rounds with me, for a fact.""

Bell's last appearance in the NFL happened in 2021 during his stint with the Tampa Bay Buccaners. He had his best years as a professional football player when he was a member of the Steelers. He was named to three All-Pro teams and was a three-time Pro Bowler in Pittsburgh.
But Bell hasn't fared quite as well in the boxing world. He has a 1-1 record in his limited time as a boxer. He also faced Adrian Peterson in an exhibition, which Bell won by knockout.

Tyson released a statement saying he was excited about ""stepping into the ring"" to face Paul.
""I'm very much looking forward to stepping into the ring with Jake Paul at the AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas,"" Tyson said. ""He's grown significantly as a boxer over the years, so it will be a lot of fun to see what the will and ambition of a 'kid' can do with the experience and aptitude of a GOAT.  It's a full circle moment that will be beyond thrilling to watch; as I started him off on his boxing journey on the undercard of my fight with Roy Jones, and now I plan to finish him.""
Netflix will stream the fight on July 20.

The Cleveland Browns acquired Jerry Jeudy from the Denver Broncos in a blockbuster trade, which was made official Wednesday, and it appeared the star wide receiver took a subtle jab at his former team.
Jeudy faced criticism in the final weeks of his tenure with the Broncos as the offense sputtered, and Russell Wilson was on the verge of getting benched. He played in 16 games and had 54 catches for 758 yards and two touchdowns. He had nearly 1,000 yards receiving in 2022.

Now, Jeudy finds himself with Deshaun Watson as his quarterback, Nick Chubb in the backfield and Amari Cooper lining up parallel with him. Cleveland made it to the playoffs last season with Joe Flacco as the interim starting quarterback with Chubb and Watson sidelined.
""I heard that the Browns were interested in me even two years ago,"" Jeudy said, via the team’s website. ""To actually be here, it's a surreal moment. So, I feel like I'm at the right spot because they have been trying to get me for a long time, so I feel like I'm wanted here.

""As a player, you always want to be in a place that you feel welcomed and want to make it feel like home and want to be wanted. And so having that feeling is great.""
Jeudy said he feels like he could be a great addition to the receiving corps, which also features Elijah Moore as the No. 3 receiver and David Njoku as the tight end.
Cooper led the team with 1,250 receiving yards and 72 catches. He had five touchdowns. Njoku had 81 catches for 882 yards and six touchdowns. Moore was third in receiving yards with 640 on 58 catches and two touchdowns.

""And I stand by that. I think that's who Travis is. I did not mention him pushing his coach, which is a physical expression versus using your words and having a conversation, which is kind of like what his dad did.
""He used an insult instead of using his intellect. So, the Swifties can come for me, but I'm going to defend myself. I have said that they were in my Mount Rushmore of couples, the two of them.  I mean, they're on top of the world. They're both very successful. I've said that I literally think he's a peacock, and there are two peacocks in this relationship, and it usually doesn't work.""
Frankel compared Ed Kelce getting involved in the drama to that on the Bravo show.

The New England Patriots reportedly agreed to trade quarterback Mac Jones to the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday as the quarterback shake-up across the NFL continued.
The two sides were finalizing the trade on Sunday with talks about a sixth-round pick being involved in the swap, ESPN reported. The deal cannot be made official until the start of the new league year on Wednesday and once Jones passes a physical.

New England made Jones the quarterback of the future when he was selected No. 15 overall of the 2021 draft. He beat out Cam Newton in training camp and earned the starting job his rookie season.
The former Alabama standout led the Patriots to the playoffs in his rookie year and finished second in AP Offensive Rookie of the Year voting in 2021. He had 3,801 passing yards and 22 touchdown passes. He was the first Patriots quarterback to lead the team to the postseason since Tom Brady left.
But Jones’ performance in his second and third seasons with New England soured the confidence his coaches had in him. New England was 8-9 in 2022 and 4-13 in 2023. Jones gave up playing time to Bailey Zappe and the offense didn’t look like the well-oiled machine it had seemed to be.

With new leadership installed in the organization, and the Patriots having a high draft pick, New England decided to move on from Jones. He will likely be the backup to Trevor Lawrence in Jacksonville.

"March 6, 2024 7:00am EST","76ers part owner David Adelman: Why new 76 Place arena makes sense for team, opposition he faces",Fox News,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
PHILADELPHIA – Downtown arenas across U.S. cities are commonplace in today's sports realm.
When looking at the NBA, 28 of the 30 teams play somewhere downtown in their respective cities, whether it is the Dallas Mavericks' American Airlines Center or Boston's famous TD Garden.
The Philadelphia 76ers, along with the Chicago Bulls and their iconic United Center, do not play downtown. Instead, they are part of a South Philadelphia trio of sporting venues, specifically the Wells Fargo Center.

However, 76ers limited partner David Adelman is looking to change all that. With help from managing partners, Josh Harris and David Blitzer, he is leading the charge of ""76 Place,"" a new arena at Market East in the heart of Philadelphia that not only will impact the team and its fans, but more importantly, the city as a whole.
It is an all-in bet by the team, as the $1.5 billion it is expected to cost will be privately funded by Adelman, Harris and Blitzer. ""No cost for Philly taxpayers"" is bulletined on the project's website as well as advertisements on the video boards attached to the mall in which the arena will be built.
""I feel a tremendous amount of pressure and opportunity to bring this to Philadelphia. I feel that burden,"" Adelman told Fox News Digital after showing the vision for what he hopes will breathe new life into a part of the city he believes is ""dying.""
However, as Adelman put it many times, Philadelphians are not keen on change. Opposition to his project has been more than expected from various fronts, including the team's current landlord at Wells Fargo Center: Comcast Spectacor.
To understand why Adelman and the 76ers wish to build a brand-new arena downtown, one must first look at their current situation in South Philly.
DAVID ADELMAN, BILLIONAIRE 76ERS CO-OWNER, RECALLS HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL VANDALISM: ‘I WAS F---ING PISSED’
Control is the theme when talking to Adelman about why, from a team perspective, the team wishes to make a move. Foremost, it is no secret this ownership group has been looking for a new home, as there was a previous 2020 proposal to build a new arena at Penn's Landing.
Control starts with scheduling, which Adelman believes puts the franchise at a disadvantage compared to its peers. Comcast Spectacor sets the dates for concerts and other events at the Wells Fargo Center, followed by a draft of remaining, available dates between the NHL’s Philadelphia Flyers, also owned by the corporation, and the 76ers. Because of that, the 76ers cannot set an ideal schedule for themselves each season.
The 76ers' lease with Comcast Spectacor and Wells Fargo Center ends in 2031, which is when 76 Place is expected to be done.
""We have a productive relationship with our landlord currently, but we want to control our own path,"" Adelman said. ""We can have debates over scheduling and all this other stuff. I don’t want to debate it. We just want to control our own home, control our fan experience, and be the first priority in the building. Not the third.""
There are also team facilities, which include locker rooms, training rooms and medical services, that are not up-to-date compared to other arenas in the league. Adelman explained how proper treatment for players requires a trip to Camden, New Jersey, where the Sixers' other facility is located. The 76ers also put $10 million of their own money into locker room renovations at Wells Fargo, though what they wish to do further cannot happen at the arena.
Given Harris Blitzer Sports Entertainment has a healthy track record of productive venues across the country, Adelman has faith this project will check all the proposed boxes for the team and its fans.
""We own Prudential Center and that’s the No. 5-performing venue in the country,"" he explained. ""We know how to operate buildings really, really well. We understand venue operation. So, for us, we just think there’s a different path.""
A rendering of 76 Place, the proposed new home of the Philadelphia 76ers at Market East in Philadelphia. (76ers/76Place)
It is expected for a downtown arena to lead to multiple buildings needing to come down, or taking over a plot of land. However, with the Fashion District mall, Adelman views it as simply taking one box (the arena) and putting it on the site of another box (the mall). The arena would sit between the mall site and the Greyhound bus station behind at Filbert Street without displacing a single resident or business.
The arena will be built atop SEPTA's Jefferson Station, which has access to 220 stops via subway, Regional Rail and PATCO train lines – a huge reason why Adelman and his team chose the location. To get to Wells Fargo Center from inside the city, all travel leads through Jefferson Station anyway.
Adelman likens his vision to Boston's TD Garden, which sits above a busy train station with shops, restaurants and other amenities for fans to engage with either before or after games and events.
""Right now, if you want to go to the game, you go to the game and leave,"" Adelman explained. ""There’s no pre-game, there’s no opportunity to have a pre-game meal. The logistics don’t work for that. … We respect the fact our season ticket holders are spending a lot of money. They should be able to have a full experience. Go out to eat after work, go get something after the game. Go get a drink before you go home. We want to be able to control that. That’s what it really comes down to – that end-to-end experience.""
PHILADELPHIA JUDGE VACATAES HOMICIDE CONVICTION, FREEING MAN AFTER 34 YEARS
Right now, Market East is filled with boarded-up storefronts, as businesses have not been able to sustain themselves since the pandemic in the area. Outward-facing retail is a main point of emphasis to elevate the area, not just on days when the 76ers tip-off.
""The arena is not going to solve everything that ails downtown Philadelphia, but it becomes a catalyst that gives other people confidence,"" Adelman said. ""If Josh, David and I are going to put [$1.5 billion] downtown, will that entice a small business operator to invest $100,000 into opening his restaurant? That is the momentum we want to create.""
First, Market East is not the best area in terms of feeling safe in Philadelphia, and Adelman is well aware of that.
""First, I think the way to change safety is you start with the perception,"" he said as someone who ventured into the area at all times of day heading into the project. ""The perception of Market East at night is dark, dingy and not a lot of people there. One, light it up. Two, cameras in the neighborhoods. Three, clean it up. Clean areas feel safer. Those are things within our respective control. That’s really important.""
Also, for a fanbase so used to getting to sporting events outside the city, especially those looking to drive in to see their favorite teams, the proposal of a downtown arena has led to complaints and pushback.

""Why?"" Adelman questioned fans who do not want to see the 76ers move from South Philly. ""Again, I think Lincoln Financial Field is a great place to watch a football game. I have (had) season tickets for a long time, I’ve had Phillies tickets for a long time. I think Citizens Bank Park is a great ballpark.
""But I’m not sure it matters they’re right across the street from each other. At least it doesn’t to me because I’m going to a particular event that day. Football stadiums aren’t downtown because you need the tailgating experience and stuff like that.
""Tailgating, if you go to Boston or any of these other cities, are the bars and restaurants. That’s your pre-game experience. We want to enhance that.""
The Sixers have noted in the past to sell pre-paid parking passes to one of the 29 surrounding lots, while also looking at plausible ride-share pickup and drop-off points to allow flow instead of congestion. The team is hoping the large access via public transportation will be used more often, too.
However, these are just concerns about the arena when it is built. There is opposition coming from many directions, including their current landlord.
Comcast Spectacor used to own the 76ers, but in 2011, they sold the team to a group led by Harris and Blitzer. As mentioned, the team has looked to create its own destiny in the past, but see it coming to fruition now with 76 Place.
However, it has been a ""fight,"" as Adelman put it, with Comcast in regard to getting this project up and running. He said he has spoken with Comcast, including chairperson and CEO Brian Roberts, about the project. Though he commends him for building the company's headquarters downtown in the city where it was founded, Adelman is not trying to see eye to eye on this.
""As I said to him and said to others, when he decided to build his office building and he moved out of somebody else’s office building, I don’t remember a bunch of office landlords getting together and saying we oppose this because it’s going to create competition for us,"" Adelman said.
It is logical to say the 76ers leaving Comcast's Wells Fargo Center will create a revenue decrease, so not wanting them to leave is a warranted reaction. Comcast has said in the past it wants to continue supporting the Sixers, wants them to win championships and hopes they can remain in the fold, especially with their South Philly sports complex renovation they are looking to have done in the next decade.

It has been speculated the deal would cost around $2.5 billion and include an upgrade to the popular Xfinity Live! venue, while also adding a new mid-sized concert venue, hotel and much more.
Wells Fargo also saw a $400 million renovation that will conclude at the end of March, though Adelman points out the arena itself will be one of the oldest in the NBA by lease's end. Adelman notes HBSE invited Comcast Spectacor to join the 76ers with its Flyers at 76 Place in 2031, but they are looking at the future of the sports complex instead.
""Our vision for developing the sports and entertainment complex has been in the making for many years and recently crystalized into a tremendous opportunity to provide sustainable economic impact, all with a focus on what is best for Philadelphia in mind,"" a Comcast Spectacor spokesperson told Fox News Digital. ""We are moving ahead with this project and will be working with many partners to bring it to life. We offered the 76ers an opportunity to join with us and hope they do, as we all know, that when we all work together great things can happen for the City and the region.""
There is also the local Chinatown area where 76 Place will be. Backlash about the project has led to local protests since the proposal came down in July 2022. Locals are opposed to the project with a variety of thought processes, from construction ruining access to businesses in the area, to residents and small businesses feeling they will be priced out of the area.
Adelman and his 76 Place team have held public meetings for locals to ask questions about the project, and they have been productive. Team management has noted investment will be made in public safety, affordable housing and more in the area.
However, these public meetings have also given Adelman a different perspective on what it is like to be in the public's eye, especially with such heavy opposition.
""The best example I can give you is we did an event in front of 600 people, a public meeting. We told people no backpacks, no signs, and people will have time for public questions. All of a sudden, I see a commotion in the back and someone’s pulling a sign out of their pants. They roll it up and securities ushering them out, and all the TV cameras are following them like, ‘Oh my God, these guys are getting exactly what they want, all this attention.’ I stop the presentation. I say, ‘Excuse me, security, let them stay. And by the way, give them back their signs.’ I say, ‘You can keep your signs, but you have to stand at the front of the room and hold them up. And you’re all going to be given the opportunity to ask me questions. Anything you want, including reading the sign to me.’ Not one of them asked me a question. Paid protesters.""
Adelman also made sure to note that support for the project comes from the 12,200 jobs that will be created to build 76 Place, injecting over $2.3 billion into Center City in construction alone.

Adelman's wish to make 76 Place a lasting landmark in the center of Philadelphia for his team and its fans goes all the way back to being a product of the great city himself.
""I think Philly is a hidden gem,"" he said, as he consistently brought up the underrated dining scene as well as recalling moments as a kid while driving through the city.
""Philadelphia is a big part of my success – how I did it, where I was, all of that. And I think it’s important to do something to give back. I’ve always said to my kids that if you don’t like the way something is going, if you’re going to complain about it and not do something about it, keep your mouth shut. So, I was like, ‘This stretch of downtown is broken. It needs to be fixed. There’s a reason no one’s bought these boarded-up, vacant buildings because no one believes in it.’ Someone needs to take a chance on the city.""
Adelman is thankful for Harris and Blitzer's commitment to getting 76 Place done. He also knows his dream cannot be fulfilled without the team he has now with the Sixers and the real estate group at 76 Place.
In simple terms, Adelman is all in on a bet he hopes will spark massive change in the city he loves.
""The hyperfocus and drive to succeed is actually, I would say, one of his Hallmarks,"" Daniel Bernstein, president and chief investment officer of Campus Apartments, where Adelman is CEO, told Fox News Digital when asked about the latter's focus on 76 Place. ""When he sinks his teeth into something, it typical comes with this level of intensity and this level of focus and commitment.
""I think he's even taken it up another notch, which is exciting to see.""

""I’m up for the challenge, I’m excited by it,"" Adelman said. ""As I tell everyone, I have no Plan B. This is it. I don’t spend an ounce of time thinking about Plan B. We’re not going to fail. We’re going to get this done.""

Taylor Lewan, a three-time Pro Bowl left tackle with the Tennessee Titans during his playing days, does not think USC quarterback Caleb Williams gave off the right aura at the NFL Scouting Combine this past week.
In fact, Lewan thought the vibes were pretty bad.
""One guy that, this is up for everybody else to interpret, but I did not get a good vibe from Caleb Williams throughout the combine process,"" Lewan said on his ""Bussin With The Boys"" podcast with Will Compton. ""I know, a lot of backlash for the boy. He essentially came to the combine for the free gear and the interviews.""

Many prospects head to the combine without wanting to participate in drills, but Williams took that a step further by refusing to go through the medical review process.
""Only player in combine history not to do a medical review. Only dude [who] didn’t run, didn’t throw. His choosing not to throw was, ‘Hey, there’s a lot of film on me, you can watch that in real action. I don’t need to do that.’""
""So he essentially went there, and then I think he did one thing about sour gummies, like him and some lady sat there and tried sour candy.""

The 22-year-old Williams appeared to be having a great time in Indianapolis, where he was extremely confident and loose during his media session at the podium. He was even seen jumping into the media scrum to ask a question to a fellow prospect as well.
He said during his time that he ""didn’t feel the need"" to throw at the combine as well as do medical testing. He explained that he will undergo medical tests during team visits, where those teams – expected to be among the top picks in the 2024 NFL Draft – will get his medical records.

""I’ve played around 30 some games I believe. Go ahead and watch a live game and see how I am as a competitor,"" Williams said during his press conference.
Now, Lewan did not knock Williams’ talent, but he felt the 2022 Heisman Trophy winner gave off an attitude no teammate would want to see in a locker room.
""It’s incredible how talented he is, but he’s got this type of ‘I’m better than everyone’ attitude that it’s coming off of,"" Lewan explained. ""Now if that’s not the individual he is, he’s more than welcome to come on [the podcast] and explain himself. But what I saw from the short sample size I got of watching a few interviews of him on my way to the combine was, [the] guy is very full of himself. He’s got some big time yes people in his camp right now that are getting in his ear a little too much.
""To me, not a great look at all. This is a game where no one is bigger than the team. The name on the front is more important than the name on the back-type of attitude and he is not displaying that right now.""

Williams is expected by many to be the first name called in Detroit next month when the 2024 NFL Draft kicks off. The Chicago Bears currently own the No. 1 overall pick, and if they do not take Williams, he is not expected to make it past the Washington Commanders.
Lewan was the 11th overall pick by the Titans in 2014, playing all nine of his seasons in the NFL with Tennessee. He made three straight Pro Bowls from 2016-18 and started a career 100 games at left tackle.

Cleveland Cavaliers forward Max Strus averages nearly three made 3-pointers per game, and the most crucial make of the season came Tuesday night against the Dallas Mavericks.
The sequence began with 8.3 seconds remaining in the game and Dallas in-bounding the ball from the far sideline. Luka Doncic recovered a loose ball and found P.J. Washington under the basket for an easy lay-up and a one-point lead with 2.6 seconds left on the clock.

Strus took the ball out of bounds. He passed it to Evan Mobley before receiving it back. From 59-feet, Stus launched a desperate prayer toward the basket.
And it went in.

Strus’ Cavaliers teammates mobbed him after the shot as the Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse was jubilant. Cleveland won the game 121-119.
Strus said afterward he knew he had to get the ball up in the air and knew the ball was going to go into the basket as it left his hands.
""The last five felt pretty good,"" he said. ""I felt a rhythm, and it’s fun when you do that. Every time I shot it, I felt like it was going in, and it was. Same with the last one.""

Donovan Mitchell added 31 points to Strus’ 21.
""Man, just to see it go through, especially what he did for us in the fourth, it had to be him, too,"" Mitchell said. ""You dream of a shot like that. So for him to get that after what he did for us, the whole fourth quarter, man.""
Strus’ game-winner is the second-longest game-winner in the 3-point era. Devonte Graham made a 61-foot 3-pointer for the New Orleans Pelicans in 2021 against the Oklahoma City Thunder.
With the win, Cleveland improved to 38-19 with a slight edge over the Milwaukee Bucks for the second seed in the Eastern Conference.
Dallas fell to 33-25 and are eighth in the Western Conference.

""What he did tonight was absolutely ridiculous to come back in that fourth quarter for us to be down the way we were,"" Cleveland coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. ""But that’s who Max is. And it’s as simple sometimes as chasing down a loose ball or making an extra rotation. Max never quits and we were down and he had the same mentality.

Mecole Hardman was apparently pretty homesick.
The Super Bowl LVIII hero said last week he ""won't go back"" to the New York Jets, but he apparently has had his mind set on that for quite a while.
After spending his first four seasons with the Kansas City Chiefs and winning two Super Bowls with them, the wide receiver inked a deal with Gang Green over the offseason.
However, the Jets failed to tap into the potential that Kansas City was able to, and at the trade deadline, the Jets traded Hardman to his old team. Just a few short months later, Hardman caught the walk-off touchdown against the San Francisco 49ers to fulfill the notion that the Chiefs are a dynasty.

Well, in what may or may not be a case of tampering, Hardman admitted that he was in contact with some rather important members of the Chiefs ahead of the trade deadline, trying to get them to acquire him.
Hardman admitted that he was ""checked out"" by early October, shortly after the Jets and Chiefs faced each other, saying he did not like how he was handled by the team.
""It was over with. I had already talked to [Chiefs general manager Brett] Veach and [Patrick Mahomes] like, ‘Come get me,'"" Hardman said on NFL analyst Ryan Clark's podcast.

Hardman added that the Jets told him ""lies,"" and he felt he was misled about the punt-returning job during training camp. He said he was asked to return punts the night of their game against Kansas City to fill in for an injury, but nursing one of his own, on top of an already strained relationship with special teams coordinator Brant Boyer, he did not want to.
So, it seems pretty safe that the now three-time Super Bowl champion will play for one of 31 teams in 2024.
He is scheduled to enter the free agency market when the new league year begins in March.

While he denied he was getting divorced despite filing for it in Florida, he explained what caused the tumult in his relationship with Keeta Vaccaro during an interview on ""The Pivot"" podcast with Fred Taylor, Ryan Clark and Channing Crowder.
Hill explained the issue stemmed from a discussion with Vaccaro over a postnup.

Of course, their father, Ed Kelce, and Jason’s wife, Kylie, were also present with many others as the All-Pro center fought back his emotions while making a 45-minute speech at the podium. There were times Jason had to totally regroup, as he couldn’t help but cry in this bittersweet moment.

As brothers do, Jason and Travis continuously supported one another, even though they weren’t on the same team. That was even the case in Super Bowl LVII when the Eagles and Chiefs played against each other.
When Jason finished his speech, he walked off the stage and immediately gave a huge bear hug to Travis before doing the same with each member of his family.
It goes without saying the impact Jason has had on the Philadelphia community on and off the field. The accolades of seven Pro Bowls and six All-Pro nods to go along with a Super Bowl title during the 2017 campaign has him pegged for the Pro Football Hall of Fame one day.

He’s also been giving back to his community since joining the Eagles as a sixth-round pick in the 2011 Draft, whether it’s through his work with the Eagles Autism Foundation or his (Be)Philly Foundation.
""It is difficult to put into words how much Jason Kelce has meant to everyone in this organization, to the City of Philadelphia, and to our fans,"" Eagles chairman and CEO Jeffrey Lurie said in a statement. ""He gave everything he had to all of us for 13 years, and he did it in a way that was truly authentic. Jason was an incredible football player; a future Hall of Famer who would have been successful anywhere. But has there ever been a more perfect marriage between a player, a city and a team?
""His grit and determination, from being a walk-on linebacker at Cincinnati to an undersized sixth-round pick in 2011, are unparalleled. His intelligence and versatility, from starting as a rookie center in a lockout season to thriving under multiple coaches and offensive schemes, set him apart from others at his position. The genuine love and care he showed his coaches, teammates and staff endeared him to all he worked alongside. The passion and intensity that he poured into everything he did, both on and off the field, made a city fall in love.""
As for Travis, there's been no indication that he's going to call it quits anytime soon, especially after the Chiefs defeated the San Francisco 49ers to win back-to-back Super Bowls. He did admit that the thought of retirement had entered his mind in the past, but he isn't dwelling on it quite like Jason.

The NFL’s use of technology may finally be used to determine first downs.
Multiple reports out of the NFL Scouting Combine on Thursday noted the league tested technology to track first downs during multiple games this past season, including Super Bowl LVIII between the Kansas City Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers.
While the optical technology is reportedly not ready to be used for the 2024 season, it could very well be implemented when it is.

If approved, one of the more outdated happenings in sports – sideline chain crews being used – would be obsolete. Despite the use of replay technology and more in the NFL, the league continuously uses chain crews.

Considering how vital first downs are during NFL games, it is fair to say everyone would agree taking the human error part out of determining whether a team picked up a new set of downs would be great.
What the technology is exactly remains to be seen, but it is a truth that the NFL has had the ability to track the football during games. It is used for their Next Gen Stats, and the league says a tracking system is installed at every stadium.

However, the technology is only used for analytics purposes – not to determine downs or anything else in the game.
The technology does not, however, determine when a player is down, whether it be by elbow, knee or any other body part.
Still, players, coaches and everyone involved would likely be open to technology that determines the position of the football instead of going based off an eye test, which can be reviewed by coach’s challenge.

Shortly after the the Los Angeles Rams' season ended, head coach Sean McVay seemed cautiously optimistic about quarterback Stetson Bennett, who was placed on the reserve/non-football injury list in September after leaving the team early for an undisclosed reason.
However, apparently he got more of an answer, and it's not looking pretty for the two-time champion at Georgia.
McVay seemed to admit that the team will have a roster spot open.

""Really in our minds, we don’t have a backup quarterback that’s on this roster,"" McVay said, via the New York Post. ""But we’ll see what that looks like in terms of how that affects Stetson and the draft or free agency.""
Bennett made a public appearance at a Georgia football game in November. At the time, McVay said Bennett's absence was ""bigger than football.""
McVay said Thursday he would connect with Bennett at ""the appropriate time.""
""I think the first thing is you connect with him, which we’ll do that at the appropriate time, and you figure out, where are you at and is this something that we feel like is best for him and for our football team to bring him back into this ecosystem?"" he said. ""Those will be conversations that we will have. And then, I think once we have a better idea of what we’ll do with that, then that will give clarity.""

The Rams selected Bennett in the fourth round of last year's draft, and he spent the preseason with them. But he was placed on the reserve/non-football list in mid-September.
""Out of respect for him and the situation, I'm going to leave all the specifics and particulars in-house,"" McVay told reporters at the time. ""And I want to be able to do that out of respect for that situation, so I'm not going to really have any follow-up information or anything that I'll give in that regards.""

Bennett played four seasons at Georgia, his final two in a starting role. He totaled 8,429 yards with 66 touchdowns and 21 interceptions over 42 games, including a tremendous senior season with 4,128 yards, 27 touchdowns and a national championship in a blowout win over TCU in 2023.

Noah Lyles is aiming at history in more ways than one.
The 26-year-old may just be the face of track and field, a title an American hasn't held in quite some time. But after his three gold medals at the World Championships, he's on the fast track to similar success in Paris.
Lyles was always slated for the 100-, 200- and 4x100-meter races this summer, the three races he won the gold in last year in Hungary. But three isn't enough.

During this month's World Athletics Indoor Championships, Lyles became a part of the silver-medal winning 4x400 relay, a race Lyles had previously run just once since turning pro in 2016.
Lyles received some backlash from a fellow U.S. runner. Fred Kerley accused the United States Track and Field Association of playing favorites and adding Lyles to the group. But Lyles says this is all part of his plan to make history.
In a recent interview with Fox News Digital, Lyles said a friend told him, ""'Forget three, you need to go after four. Do something no one's ever done.'""
""When you want to talk about being the greatest, that’s what you have to achieve. So, I announced that that is a goal of mine to complete; why not do it on the biggest stage, the Olympics?""

US TRACK STAR NOAH LYLES SAYS REPRESENTING COUNTRY AT OLYMPICS IS ‘BITTERSWEET’
Lyles had not run the race during qualifiers but was a last-minute addition. He ran the third leg in an impressive 45.68 seconds, and had Belgium's Alexander Doom not run a flawless 44.88 anchor leg, Lyles would've won gold in Glasgow, Scotland.
So, while it may not look good to his other competitors, Lyles says this was all ""planned."" However, four gold medals aren't even his focus.
Lyles is the heavy favorite to win the 200-meter, but now, he's in the conversation to beat Usain Bolt's world record of 19.19.
Obviously, a gold in the event would be nice, but there's more on the line for Lyles.

""It's the dream goal. It’s the first world record that I kind of put up as ‘I want that to be mine,’"" Lyles says. ""The 100, I’ve still been learning, but the 200 is my favorite event, and it’s the time I’ve put the most into. So, when I look at it, I’m like, ‘Yeah, that’s the world record I want to be mine first.’""
Bolt ran his 19.19 at the 2009 World Championships in Berlin; Lyles' current personal best is 19.31, the third-fastest ever and current U.S. record.

There was a scary moment in the Grapefruit League Saturday when a player had to be carted off the field after he tried to rob a home run.
In Fort Myers, the Boston Red Sox were hosting the Washington Nationals in spring training action, and Daylen Lile was making his first appearance of the spring.
Lile was playing right field for the Nationals when Tyler Miller crushed a fly ball toward the right-center field gap at JetBlue Park at Fenway South in Fort Myers.

Miller's blast cleared the wall, but not without a valiant effort by Lile to record an out. The 21-year-old leaped to try to rob Miller of a solo shot, but he flipped over the wall instead.
Lile looked like Torii Hunter during David Ortiz's famous game-tying grand slam in Game 2 of the 2013 ALCS. The spring training park is a replica of Fenway, and the low outfield wall in right tends to do that to outfielders who try to rob homers.
However, the situation quickly became serious when Red Sox relievers in the bullpen almost immediately called on medical personnel.
Through a crack in the outfield wall that opens up, Lile could be seen rolling around in the bullpen.
The game was delayed several minutes, and Lile was placed on a stretcher with a neck brace on the warning track.
After the game, Nats manager Dave Martinez said Lile was transported to a hospital for a CT scan of his lower back and had movement in his arms and legs. Lile gave a thumbs-up to the crowd while leaving the field.

""When you see someone go over the wall like that, and you don’t see them get up, then everyone in the bullpen started calling like that, you think, ‘Oh no,’"" said Martinez. ""You just hope he didn’t hit his head, his neck. All these things go through your mind.""
Lile was drafted by the Nats in the second round of the 2021 MLB Draft, playing 19 games of rookie ball that year. He missed the entire 2022 season while recovering from Tommy John surgery and split last year between low- and high-A ball.

Cornerback Sauce Gardner reacted Tuesday to the news that independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is considering the four-time league MVP as a potential running mate in 2024.

The New York Times first reported that Rodgers was on Kennedy’s short list. A representative for Kennedy later confirmed it to Fox News Digital.
Rodgers has been outspoken about his support of Kennedy in the past. In October, he said during an appearance on ""The Pat McAfee Show"" that he would even team up with Kennedy in a debate against Travis Kelce, who he then called ""Mr. Pfizer.""
But being on the presidential campaign trail might conflict with Rodgers' other interests – winning a Super Bowl with the Jets.

The goal of bringing the Vince Lombardi Trophy back to New York in his first season with the team came to an abrupt end in the Jets’ season opener in September when Rodgers suffered a ruptured Achilles just four plays into his debut.
He impressed fans with his speedy recovery, and even suggested a possible comeback before the season’s end, which would have depended on where the Jets’ playoff chances stood.
Rodgers said in January that he hopes his career will keep him in New York beyond the 2024 season.

If you have a down year, a bad year, there’s going to be people calling to move on, and especially when you’re 40 years old.""
""So, I’m going to go out there and play as well as I can. And obviously, if I have the season I know that I’m capable of having, and we have the success I know we’re capable of having, then all that stuff takes care of itself,"" he added.

"March 3, 2024 4:09pm EST",Projected top 10 NFL Draft pick suffers injury during Combine: reports,Fox News,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Offensive tackle Olu Fashanu, a projected top 10 pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, bowed out of his NFL Scouting Combine performance on Sunday due to injury.
No one ever wants to see a prospect hurt during the Combine, but it’s the unfortunate reality that sometimes happens when draftees try to vault their draft stock. Clemson cornerback Nate Wiggins ran a blazing 40-yard dash earlier this weekend, but suffered a hip injury in the process.
Fashanu, a Penn State product, left with a right thigh injury, according to multiple reports. He was seen walking around with that thigh wrapped in ice.

Fashanu, though, seemed to be in good spirits, according to the NFL Network. He believes that he will be fine to perform at Penn State’s Pro Day on March 15, and he’s someone many teams will be waiting to see given his status among his peers.
Fashanu measures 6-foot-6, 312 pounds with 34-inch arms and an 82 and 5/8th wingspan, along with an 8-and-a-half-inch hand.

These are all prototypical measurables for someone who plays his position, and his speed and strength have proven to be something evaluators believe will translate to the next level.
Fashanu is the best offensive tackle prospect in the NFL Draft depending on which expert or evaluator you talk to, but there’s no question many NFL teams believe him to be first-round worthy.

Notre Dame’s Joe Alt, who plays the same position, is also among those who shouldn’t last long on day one of the NFL Draft, which will be held in Detroit.
Fashanu was a team captain last season for the Nittany Lions, starting 12 games at left tackle. He has 21 career starts at the position, and was named the 2023 Big Ten Offensive Lineman of the Year as well as first-team All-Big Ten.
Fashanu did have an undisclosed injury that he suffered in 2022, which forced him to start just eight games.

Court-storming has been one of the hottest topics in sports after Duke star Kyle Filipowski injured his knee in a collision with a fan.
It has escaped the professional sports world within the last few decades, but the art remains in college sports, making for some all-time moments.
However, there have already been two high-profile incidents this year – one involving Filipowski, and another with Caitlin Clark.

Filipowski's injury has led to a strong outcry that court-storming needs to be banned – but a prominent former coach says it's not that easy.
Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., experienced plenty of intense atmospheres during his coaching days at Ole Miss, Auburn, Texas Tech and Cincinnati before going into politics.

Tuberville coached 258 games with tens of thousands of crazed fans, and in his mind, those fans outweigh any potential banning.

Especially in a football game. You got 80, 90, 100,00 people in the stands. You're not keeping people from running on the field. But it needs to be talked about, needs to be discussed, make sure they educate young people on what to do and how to do it, and if they're gonna do it, they need to use all the precaution they can.""
Tuberville also made mention that limiting some incidents is possible – he noted goalposts became collapsible after they were torn down on occasion.

Philadelphia Flyers head coach John Tortorella was back arguing with referees on the ice, and this time he refused to leave the bench when he was ejected.
Tortorella wasted no time getting into it with the striped shirts, specifically Wes McCauley, who tossed him with 9:11 left in the first period after the Flyers coach argued a goal.
Tampa Bay Lightning forward Brayden Point scored a power play goal that came after Ronnie Attard was called for a trip. Tortorella took massive exception to the penalty, which made the Flyers go on the penalty kill with a man down on the ice.

At this point, though, the Flyers were getting blown out as Point’s goal gave the Lightning a 4-0 lead halfway through the first period. Perhaps Tortorella was trying to get his team fired up with his ejection.
WATCH THE MOMENT ON X
Either way, he certainly got his money’s worth.
McCauley announced Tortorella was hit with a bench minor penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct and a game misconduct. He, then, motioned Tortorella to get off the bench and head to the locker, but the longtime NHL coach stood his ground.

The Flyers-Lightning broadcast caught Tortorella arguing with McCauley, and though there’s no audio, you can make out what the former is saying to the other in this situation and it wasn’t nice.
""I’m not!"" he can see Tortorella screaming to McCauley. ""F--- off!""
Finally, after about two minutes of standing off against McCauley, Tortorella yelled one more insult before walking off the bench and into the locker room.
The irony of this ejection is the Lightning honored the 2004 Stanley Cup-champion team, which Tortorella coached. During the standoff, the camera panned to a box with numerous former Lightning players that were seen laughing, as they’ve certainly seen their coach like this in the past.

After the 7-0 loss to the Lightning, Tortorella didn’t speak to the media, but assistant coach Brian Shaw addressed what happened on the ice.
""I think he was just trying to make a point that we felt like we might not have been getting our fair shake,"" Shaw said.
While everyone can laugh at ""Torts,"" every game means that much more as the NHL regular season begins to enter the homestretch in the coming weeks. The Flyers own third place in the Metropolitan division with 74 points, which earns them a playoff spot if the season ended today.
But there are many regular-season games left to play and teams like the New York Islanders (70 points), Washington Capitals (69) and New Jersey Devils (66) still have a chance to keep up.

""For me, I said it immediately after our Detroit game, following the loss: To build a winning team and to have a lot of the key pieces that we needed back to continue this run and improve it, some sacrifices have to be made,"" Mayfield responded.
""Now, listen, this is life-changing money, and I'm not going to act otherwise. It's something that I've worked extremely hard for over the years and many years of football. I'm grateful for it. There's nothing to be ashamed about. There's nothing to say, 'Oh, well he got more.' It's not that mentality. Knowing that we have a chance to bring back some key pieces and make a further run in the playoffs, that's important to me. I'm a winner at heart, I hate losing, so knowing that we get a lot of guys back, and we can continue to build this for years to come, is a special thing.""

""From the very beginning, the organization made me comfortable in saying, 'Be the best version of yourself.' As a quarterback, somebody that you always have eyes on you, there's no other words that can make you feel more welcomed than that,"" he added Wednesday.

For me, this was a good place that has already shown me that I can do that.""

The Calgary Flames have renounced the rights to 2022 NHL Draft pick Topi Ronni after the Finnish hockey player was sentenced on Tuesday in his native country for a 2021 rape case.
Ronni,19, was given a one-year suspended prison sentence by the District Court of Helsinki, his team in Finland, Tappara Tampere, said in a news release on Tuesday.

Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's NBA scoring record was once considered unbreakable, but it's being shattered.
LeBron James surpassed the Hall of Famer last year to become the NBA's all-time leading scorer.
And, on Saturday, the four-time MVP became the first player in NBA history to score 40,000 points in a career.

Entering the night, James needed just nine points to reach the mark. The last time James had scored fewer than 10 points was Jan. 5, 2007, so this was pretty much a lock.
He airballed his first shot but knocked down his next two to get to within four points. He took a seat with 3:19 to go in the first quarter, so fans had to wait a tad longer. James started the second quarter and promptly got a layup to put him one bucket shy.
He missed his first attempt at it — a deep three-pointer. But on the next possession, he pulled out a spin move in the paint for another layup, putting him at exactly 40,000.
James has lived up to the billing as ""The Chosen One"" from that famous 2002 Sports Illustrated piece written by the late Grant Wahl. His 40,000 points now top one of the greatest sports resumes ever.
He is in his 21st NBA season at age 39, yet he's hardly shown signs of slowing down.
Entering Saturday night, James, who was selected to his NBA record 20th All-Star Game earlier this year, was averaging 25.3 points, 7.9 assists and 7.1 rebounds. He's one of just four players this season with at least 50 games played to average at least 25-7-7, along with Nikola Jokić, Luka Dončić and Trae Young.

Of players who have played more than 100 games at age 35 and older, James' 27.2 points per game are the most ever by a decent margin. Second is Michael Jordan, who averaged 22.5 in 171 games after turning 35. Saturday marked James' 245th game since turning 35.
Including the playoffs, James played in his 1,757th game Saturday, 40 shy of Abdul-Jabbar's all-time mark.
FORMER NBA PROSPECT SENTENCED TO 90 YEARS IN PRISON FOR MULTIPLE SEXUAL ASSAULTS
James has been vocal about his hopes to play with son Bronny, who is eligible for this year's NBA Draft. There is also speculation LeBron wants to play with his younger son, Bryce, who some scouts say actually profiles better than his older brother. Bryce won't be eligible to play in the NBA until 2026.

Paul Heyman has been at the top of the pro wrestling world for at least a decade.
Whether he’s been in the corner of CM Punk, Brock Lesnar or Roman Reigns, he’s been a prominent figure on the WWE main event scene.
While Heyman hasn’t always been a favorite in WWE, his success speaks for itself.
He guided Extreme Championship Wrestling against the WWE behemoth and made a lasting mark on the industry that will be remembered forever.

So, how does someone like Heyman, who will be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame during WrestleMania 40, stay on top?
""I treat every single performance as simply an audition to be invited back tomorrow,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""I never rest on my laurels. I wanted to be judged on my absolute worst performance and start the standard from there. The day that someone walks through the curtain and simply says, ‘It’s me, it’s me, it’s gonna be great.’ No, that’s not the case.
""You have to earn it every single solitary time. Got to think it through better. You have to imagine it more passionately, and you have to deliver it better than anybody else can deliver it because there’s always someone who is trying to take that position.""
Heyman said the stats speak for themselves.

It will be the fifth consecutive time he’s a part of a WrestleMania main event and the eighth consecutive year he’s in a title match at WrestleMania.
He will very likely be in The Bloodline’s corner when Reigns and The Rock take on Cody Rhodes and Seth Rollins in a tag-team match at WrestleMania in April and when Reigns and Rhodes face off for the WWE Undisputed Universal Championship.

""These are stats no one else can claim. Nobody. Nobody even comes remotely close,"" he said. ""Every single one of them, there are people sitting there saying, ‘I want that job. I want that position. I’m willing to compete with Paul Heyman for that position,’ and I’m cognizant of it. I’m very much aware of it.
""And I remind myself of that every single day there are very competent and talented people who want that spot. So, I treat every single performance like it’s an audition to be invited back tomorrow. And if people approach their performances like that, it’ll only inspire them and motivate them to rise above even their own limitations.""

Super Bowl-winning quarterback Russell Wilson is joining the Pittsburgh Steelers, he announced on Sunday night.
The 35-year-old quarterback had permission from the Denver Broncos to pursue his next NFL team prior to their official release of him when the new league year begins March 13. The Steelers were among the teams he had visited already, and he spent over six hours with them this past Friday.
Wilson will sign a team-friendly deal with the Steelers for one year, ESPN reports.

Wilson made his intentions known via social media.
""Year 13. Grateful. @Steelers,"" he posted on X with an accompanying video of Steelers fans waving their ""Terrible Towels"" at Acrisure Stadium in Pittsburgh.
SEE WILSON'S POST ON X
It was always expected that whichever team recruited Wilson’s services wouldn’t have to break the bank to do so, since the Broncos still have to pay $38 million of his salary for next season.
The Steelers were always a team that made sense for Wilson, as they’ve struggled to find a starting quarterback since Ben Roethlisberger retired. Kenny Pickett, the team’s first-round pick in 2022, owns a 14-10 record as a starter since entering the league, but he’s thrown just 13 touchdowns to 13 interceptions in those 24 games.
BRONCOS TO RELEASE RUSSELL WILSON AFTER 2 SEASONS
The lack of consistent quarterback play led to Mitch Trubisky’s occasional starts over the last two seasons, and Mason Rudolph was under center at the end of 2023, including during the team’s playoff loss to the Buffalo Bills.
So, Wilson should be heading into training camp as the presumed starter for an offense desperate to break out.
Wilson expressed his desire recently to keep playing for Super Bowl rings following a disaster in Denver. He was benched at the end of the regular season in 2023 amid controversy over his injury guarantee in his contract.

He ended up finishing 7-8 on the year, which was better than the 4-11 inaugural campaign he put together in 2022.
The Broncos made their intentions known that Wilson would be on the way out when the new league year kicked in, even though his release would account for $85 million in dead cap money.
""We spoke with Russell Wilson today to inform of his release after the start of the league year,"" general manager George Paton and head coach Sean Payton said in a joint statement. ""On behalf of the Broncos, we thank Russell for his contributions and dedication to our team and community while wishing him the best as he continues his career.""
""As we move forward, we are focused on building the strongest team possible for the 2024 season and beyond. We are excited to improve this offseason and will have the flexibility to get better through the draft and free agency.""

Carson Beck helped lift Georgia football to a 12-0 regular season record last year. The quarterback seemed to contemplate leaving Athens, but he ultimately decided to return for another run with the Bulldogs.
When Beck arrived at Georgia's football complex on Tuesday, his flashy new vehicle, a Lamborghini Uros Performante, was a hot topic. A 2023 version of the vehicle starts at approximately $260,000. The price can surpass $300,000 if a buyer selects certain add-ons.
Beck created a stir when he posted a photo of the luxury vehicle during the offseason. Shortly after the photo made it rounds across social media, several questions also began to surface.

Beck also shared a post to Instagram which appeared to show him flying on a private jet during spring break. It’s unclear if the trip was affiliated with a name, image, and likeness (NIL) deal.
Beck, a self-proclaimed ""car guy,"" said he used to dream about owning a Ford Mustang.
""I've always been car guy since I was a kid. I grew up always loving cars. My dream car when I was super, super young was always a Mustang,"" Beck said.
""I've never had a Mustang, but I kinda grew out of it when I was 14 or 15. I've always been a huge car guy. Growing into that, and being able to associate myself with that brand, it's a large brand name. Being able to get that car, it's obviously a blessing. Being able to associate myself [with Lamborghini] and get that car, it's been awesome.""

Several prominent members of the football world have said that Nick Saban retired because of NIL running rampant - they might have been right.
Saban, 72, called it a career in January - an illustrious career that included seven national championships, making him arguably the greatest college football coach of all time.
However, with the recent skyrocketing of name, image and likeness (NIL) deals, college athletics has changed a lot, and they are not what Saban is used to.
""What we have now is not college football -- not college football as we know it. You hear somebody use the word 'student-athlete.' That doesn't exist,"" Saban said in an interview with ESPN, whom he recently joined as a ""College GameDay"" analyst.

""I do know I'd like to impact college football the best way I can, whether it's being a spokesperson or anything else,"" Saban said. ""Listen, I'm for the players. It's not that I'm not for the players. I want to see the players have a great quality of life and be able to create value for themselves. But we've gone to nobody talking about education, nobody talking about creating value for their future, to talking only about how much money can I make while I'm in college.

""Just like an NFL player has a contract or a coach has a contract, something in place, so you don't have all this raiding of rosters and mass movement,"" he said. ""I wonder what fans are going to say when they don't even know the team from year to year because there's no development of teams, just bringing in new players every year.""
Saban has been critical of NIL before, saying that players were going ""where they can make the most money.""
He even reportedly rejected two players who were searching for north of $1 million in such a deal.
Saban was one of the leads of the SEC contingent that headed to Washington, D.C., last summer to meet with lawmakers in efforts to regulate NIL.
""I don't think it's going to be a level playing field because some people were showing a willingness to spend more than others,"" Saban said at the time. ""Whereas, if you want to bring the NFL into it, they have a salary cap. They have all the things that level the playing field. We can put guidelines on this stuff that would do the same thing.""

Admittedly, Saban does not have much of a solution and knows others, notably SEC commissioner Greg Sankey, are better suited to find one.
""It's one thing to come up with a solution. It's another thing to implement it,"" he said. ""I'm just here to help.""
Saban won six of his titles with Alabama and another with LSU in 2003.

"February 23, 2024 6:18pm EST","Pelicans' social media team, TV analyst rip Stephen A. Smith for 'lazy' Zion Williamson criticism",Fox News,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Stephen A. Smith caught some flak from the New Orleans Pelicans after he criticized their biggest star.
On Friday's edition of ""Get Up,"" Smith and Mike Greenberg were discussing the Pelicans and Zion Williamson, who has made his share of headlines with injuries and off-court issues.
One of those issues, Williamson has admitted, is his eating habits.

In July, the 2019 No. 1 overall pick admitted ""it's hard"" to stay in top shape since he's young with ""all the money in the world.""
However, a report in December said Williamson simply ""doesn't listen"" to the organization's requests to take his diet seriously. Around that time, he looked sluggish on the floor, notably in the In-Season Tournament.
Williamson is averaging 24.3 points in his last 14 games, which is just a tick lower than his career mark of 24.9, but Smith isn't convinced.
""Zion Williamson, it's not about his game. It's about how many burgers he's eating and whether or not he's gonna be in shape. Or is he gonna keep eating McDonald's?"" Smith said Friday morning. ""That's what he has to prove — that the chefs don't love him any longer, that he's committed to playing basketball and being in shape.""

That prompted both the Pelicans' social media team and one of their broadcasters to rip Smith in return.
The social media team kept it blunt, posting a graphic of Smith's college basketball stats, when he averaged just 1.5 points per game in one season.
They also posted a montage of Smith's athletic ""highlights.""
Pelicans TV analyst Antonio Daniels didn't go the troll route, though, and went right after Smith for being ""lazy.""
""Listen man, I am all for objective, fair critiquing of individuals and, collectively, of teams,"" he said on SiriusXM’s NBA Radio. ""I felt what Stephen A. said this morning of Zion was completely inappropriate and lazy. If you have an issue, there’s a way to go about addressing that issue.
""[The Pelicans] have won eight of their last nine games, but then you wake up this morning and this right here is the topic? To me, it’s almost gotten to the point where it’s personal.""

Tuesday's Big Ten matchup between Wisconsin and Indiana had quite a peculiar delay on Tuesday night.
In a tight battle, with the teams knotted at 54 with just about 10 minutes to go, everyone at Indiana's Assembly Hall was abruptly forced to evacuate the building.
With around 10:06 to go, the fire alarm on the balcony of the venue went off.

There was much speculation about the original delay - there had been inclement weather in the area, and Wisconsin announcer Matt Lepay said there was smoke in an elevator that prompted the alarm.
Indiana University did not reveal what set off the fire alarms, but the evacuation was state law.
""It was determined a fire alarm went off in the balcony,"" the university said. ""Emergency management officials stationed in the Simon Skjodt Assembly Hall Command Center followed state law and evacuated the arena for the safety and well-being of everyone in attendance. Once it was determined there was no immediate threat, everyone was allowed back in the building.""

The evacuation lasted roughly 11 minutes, and the game resumed after the teams warmed up for about five minutes.
Perhaps the Hoosiers needed the fire alarms - they led by as many as 15 in the first half, but squandered the lead.
In fact, the fire alarms went off right after John Blackwell of Wisconsin hit back-to-back layups to tie the game - that was the first time the Badgers weren't trailing in the game since it was 0-0.

Even after play resumed, Wisconsin owned a three-point lead with 5:54 to go, but the Hoosiers ended the game on a 14-7 run to come away with a 74-70 victory - Wisconsin missed their final six shots of the game.

The fight will mark Paul’s second bout of the year and Tyson’s first since his exhibition match with Roy Jones Jr. in 2020.
""He's grown significantly as a boxer over the years, so it will be a lot of fun to see what the will and ambition of a ‘kid’ can do with the experience and aptitude of a GOAT,"" Tyson’s statement read.

Paul, 27, is coming off a first-round victory over Ryan Bourland in Puerto Rico. It marked his ninth victory in 10 professional fights, each of the last two having come against fellow boxers after fights against MMA fighters like Nate Diaz and Anderson Silva.

Shohei Ohtani shocked the world on Thursday in an Instagram post when he revealed that he not only has a significant other, but he was married.
As such, Ohtani’s personal life, which has been mainly out of the spotlight since he came to MLB, was the hottest topic at Los Angeles Dodgers spring training on Thursday.
Speaking with reporters, Ohtani explained his decision to go public with his marriage to a ""normal Japanese woman,"" who he said he was engaged to last year.

""She is a Japanese woman,"" Ohtani said. ""I don’t really feel comfortable talking about when I got married exactly, but she’s a normal Japanese woman.""
Ohtani said he did not want to have any distractions in the offseason.
""I felt like it was good timing because it was before the season,"" he added. ""I didn’t really want any distractions once the season started. I would have liked to announce it earlier, but there were some paperwork issues that (delayed) the whole process.""
Ohtani had known his wife for about three to four years, according to The Athletic.

Ohtani also made sure to point out that his free agency decision to join the Dodgers, who inked him for a whopping $700 million over the next 10 seasons, had ""absolutely nothing to do"" with his relationship, the LA Times reported. His wife was, however, supportive of the decision to remain on the West Coast.
Ohtani’s post, which came in the middle of the night in Los Angeles but was in the afternoon in Japan, sent many into a frenzy.

"February 27, 2024 9:55pm EST",Vikings GM slams door on Justin Jefferson trade rumors: 'Not something that has ever crossed my mind',Fox News,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
The Minnesota Vikings' front office will have their hands full this offseason.
The franchise likely wants to find a way to bring back quarterback Kirk Cousins, and come to an agreement on a long-term contract that will keep star wide receiver Justin Jefferson in Minnesota for the long haul.
Jefferson, a three-time All-Pro, is scheduled to play in 2024 under the fifth-year option of his rookie deal. Jefferson is expected to earn $19.743 million, according to the formula laid out in the NFL's collective bargaining agreement with the NFL Players Association.
However, the Vikings and Jefferson's representatives have been engaged in negations on a lucrative long-term deal since the end of the 2022 season, per reports from ESPN.

As the two sides continued to fall short of reaching an agreement, rumors began to surface about the Vikings potentially trading Jefferson. But, Vikings general manager Kwesi Adofo-Mensah quickly shut down those rumors.
""That is not something that has ever crossed my mind,"" Adofo-Mensah said at the NFL Combine regarding the idea of dealing the star wideout. ""You got a blue(chip) player, a blue(chip) person. You try to keep as many of those as you can.""
DAVANTE ADAMS TRADE RUMORS SHUT DOWN BY NEW RAIDERS GM TOM TELESCO
Adofo-Mensah hinted that the team was on the verge of reaching an agreement with Jefferson last offseason.
""We had a lot of great dialogue last offseason,"" he said. ""I think people forget, deals rarely happen after three years, and there is a reason for that. Two years left. There is uncertainty that somebody's got to hold — either the club's got to hold, or the player's got to hold. There's new money, old money. How do you look at contracts? Those are very hard conversations to have. So a lot of them don't get done. We got unbelievably close.""

Vikings head coach Kevin O'Connell also railed against the idea that Jefferson would depart the team via a trade.
""I can tell you we have no intent to trade Justin Jefferson. We have had zero discussions, dialogue about that either internally, externally, on this planet or another planet,"" O'Connell said.
""I feel very strongly that Justin is best in his position in football. Any time you're trying to reset the receiver market — we know who he is, we know what Justin's earned through his first four years in this league — you know how hard it is. ... It was never gonna be something that was just be easy to get done, but the intent was there. The intent is still stronger than ever to get something done with Justin.""

Jefferson is widely regarded as the best player at his position in the NFL. He missed seven games last year due to injury, but still finished the season with 1,074 receiving yards. His 5,899 career receiving yards is the most in NFL history over a player's first four seasons.

In 2022, Jefferson finished with an NFL-best 128 receptions for a league-leading 1,809 yards. He received NFL Offensive Player of the Year honors for his strong performance.

WWE later confirmed his death.
""WWE is saddened to learn that Michael Jones, known to WWE fans as Virgil, has passed away,"" the company announced. ""WWE extends its condolences to Jones’ family, friends and fans.""
Virgil got his start with Memphis-based Championship Wrestling and later won championships in the American Wrestling Association.
OLE ANDERSON, ONE OF WRESTLING'S 'FOUR HORSEMEN,' DEAD AT 81
He moved to the World Wrestling Federation (now known as WWE) and became the bodyguard for ""Million Dollar Man"" Ted DiBiase. He and DiBiase were involved in pivotal moments with the company and had a hand in Andre the Giant beating Hulk Hogan for the World Heavyweight Championship after nearly five years. Virgil was in the corner of DiBiase and Andre in a tag-team match against Hogan and Randy Savage.
Virgil became a fan favorite as part of a storyline with DiBiase after the 1991 Royal Rumble. He defeated DiBiase at WrestleMania VI for the Million Dollar Championship. The crowd at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena erupted for Virgil’s victory.

He moved on from the WWF and, by 1996, found himself with the rival World Championship Wrestling as Vincent. He became a security guard for the dominant New World Order faction, which helped escalate the ratings wars between WWF and WCW at the time.
He retired from full-time wrestling in 2000 but made appearances for other companies, including WWE, sparingly. He appeared in All Elite Wrestling as Soul Train Jones in 2019 and 2020.
After his wrestling career, Virgil became a mainstay at wrestling conventions, signing autographs for fans.

The Washington Nationals got good news on Sunday as outfield prospect Daylen Lile was released from the hospital following a scary spill against the Boston Red Sox in a spring training game.
Red Sox prospect Tyler Miller launched his first home run of the spring on Saturday in the seventh inning, but there was concern when Lile, trying to make a miracle home run robbery, flipped over the bullpen wall and landed hard.
It was a reminder of the infamous flip Torii Hunter had at Fenway Park on David Ortiz’s game-tying grand slam in game 2 of the 2013 ALCS. JetBlue Park in Fort Myers, Florida, which is the home of the Red Sox in the spring, has the same low outfield wall in right field that mimics Fenway.

While the broadcast didn’t show how Lile fell into the bullpen, the relievers and staff who were there immediately signaled for trainers to come check on him. They continued to wave until people showed up to evaluate what happened.
Lile was eventually stretchered out of the stadium and there was fear something severe had happened.

Martinez said after the game on Saturday that a CT scan would be taken of Lile’s back and that he had movement in his arms and legs.
Lile also gave a thumbs-up to the crowd, showing that he had some optimism despite his situation.
The 21-year-old was a second-round draft pick by the Nats in the 2021 MLB Draft. He played in 19 games his rookie year before missing the entire 2022 season after needing Tommy John surgery.
Lile split his 2023 season in Low-A and High-A ball, hitting .291 with a .891 OPS over 66 Low-A games.

Zach Wilson has had a rather turbulent run with the Jets, but it appears his time in New York could be nearing an end.
During a media session at the NFL Combine, Jets General Manager Joe Douglas revealed that he informed Wilson's representatives that the quarterback could begin exploring a potential trade.
Douglas' comments come on the heels of team owner Woody Johnson's assessment of the franchise's quarterback room: ""We need a backup quarterback. We didn't have one last year,"" Johnson said this month. Wilson technically began the 2023 season as the No. 2 quarterback, behind veteran signal-caller Aaron Rodgers.

""I'm going to circle back with Brian at some point this week or next week just to see how those conversations go,"" Douglas said. ""But other than that, there's nothing else to report.""

Wilson was thrust into the starting role for the Jets when Rodgers suffered a season-ending injury in the first quarter of a Week 1 game. Wilson won five of his 12 appearances this season, but his performances failed to convince the Jets front office that he was a franchise-caliber player.

The compensation the Jets could receive in a potential trade for Wilson remains unclear.
Wilson was the second overall selection in the 2021 NFL Draft and handled the Jets' starting quarterback duties in his first two seasons.

Wilson was largely inconsistent during his first couple of seasons in the NFL. His struggles continued in 2023, prompting head coach Robert Saleh to bench Wilson in favor of journeyman Tim Boyle. Wilson did return to action, until his season ended in Week 15 due to a concussion.
Wilson has one-year remaining on his rookie deal, and the Jets have yet to pick up his contract's fifth-year option.

Douglas suggested the team will cast a wide net in its search for a backup quarterback.

Legendary Alabama Crimson Tide football coach Nick Saban was among a roundtable discussion in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, led by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, to talk about the future of college athletics, specifically finding a balance in the new world with the transfer portal and name, image and likeness (NIL) deals.
Saban surprisingly called it quits for his historic career after the 2023-24 collegiate season, which ended in a Rose Bowl loss to the eventual national-champion Michigan Wolverines, and the pay-for-play landscape that college sports has become seems to have played some role in his decision even if he has denied that was the case in past interviews.
In front of the panel with Cruz, who is involved in drafting NIL legislation, and others like Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne, Saban provided an anecdote with his wife, Terry, who shed some light on his future.

""All the things I’ve believed in for all these years — 50 years of coaching — no longer exist in college athletics,"" Saban said when asked by Cruz if the ""current chaos"" in college sports led to his retirement. ""It’s always was about developing players, always been about helping people be more successful in life.
""My wife even said to me — we have all the recruits over on Sunday with their parents for breakfast. She would always meet with the mothers and talk about how she was going to help impact their sons and how they would be well taken care of. She came to me right before I retired and said, ‘Why are we doing this?’ I said, ‘What do you mean?’ She said, ‘All they care about is how much you’re going to pay them. They don’t care about how you’re going to develop them, which is what we’ve always done. So why are you doing this?’
""To me, that was sort of a red alert that we really are creating a circumstance here that is not beneficial to the young people, which is why I always did what I did. My dad did it, I did it. So that’s the reason I always like college athletics more than the NFL because you had the opportunity to develop young people.""
NICK SABAN REVEALS CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO ALABAMA RETIREMENT
Saban prefaced his story with his wife by explaining why he got into coaching.
""Basically, I always did what I did so people would be more successful in life,"" he said. ""You’re trying to develop a value-based system just like a value-based business that would create opportunities for young people to be more successful. So, this started with personal development. This started with academic support to make sure guys graduated and prepared themselves for when they couldn’t play football.
""Also, the whole concept of branding and making sure you had an image out there that was going to be something that would enhance your chances to be successful and create opportunities for your future. And see if you could develop yourself as a football player.
""What we’ve done between freedom to transfer and creating a free agency system where guys can transfer whenever they wanted to transfer. The whole idea that we’ve created a pay-for-play sort of model in college athletics has created some issues in being able to actually have a program and a system that would enhance those very values that I just talked about.""

Saban added that the ""competitive balance"" is nowhere to be found in college athletics because it’s all about who’s willing to pay the most money to these current and prospective student-athletes.
""It’s whoever pays the most money, raises the most money, buys the most players — they’re going to have the best opportunity to win. I don’t think that’s the spirit of college athletics. I don’t think it’s ever been the spirit of what we want college athletics to be.
""I can attest that I’ve had two NFL coaches tell me — and this is a football deal because they’re concerned about the football part — that the players come to them less developed with more entitlement and less resiliency to overcome adversity.""
""If that’s true in the football development, is that true in other parts of their development?""
Saban said shortly after making his retirement announcement in January that NIL and the transfer portal were not the reasons for his retirement, repeating that during an ESPN interview earlier in March. He did, however, mention relationships with players being a factor.
Now, Saban is not a stickler for NIL deals, as he reiterated how much he understands a brand can help improve ""quality of life"" for student-athletes.

The NFL world is still stunned after watching wide receiver Xavier Worthy rewrite the 40-yard dash record at the Combine with a 4.21-second finish on Saturday night.
Worthy, who ran a 4.25-second 40 before breaking John Ross's 4.22 record in his second attempt, turned every head in Indianapolis, had the perfect response on social media after going viral.
The Texas Longhorns product took to X to let every NFL team, and their fans, know speed isn't the only part of his game he's bringing to the next level.

""Turn on the film the routes there don’t let that lil 40 mess your head up,"" Worthy wrote.
Worthy knows that speed can be a game-changer in an offense, but the best of the best are in the NFL, and it will take more than speed to get open on his next team.
But speed like Worthy’s can make up for moments where route-running isn’t at its best.
TEXAS' XAVIER WORTHY BREAKS 40-YARD DASH RECORD AT NFL COMBINE
There were times he didn’t need to do much fancy footwork with the Longhorns, as head coach Steve Sarkisian used him as his deep threat, especially in 2023 when Texas made the College Football Playoff.
Worthy finished his final collegiate season with 75 catches for 1,014 yards and five touchdowns over 14 games on a roster that included other offensive stars like fellow receiver Adonai Mitchell, who also had a solid Combine performance.

Teams will be sure to look at the film to see where Worthy fits in their offense, but in a league that has seen speedy receivers make life much easier for coaches, it’s only a matter of when his name is called.
However, one of the main issues called upon by experts when discussing Worthy’s transition to the next level is his size at 160 pounds. He’s also had some drop issues during his college career. But again, speed can make up for a lot.
After Worthy continued sprinting around Lucas Oil Stadium following his record-breaking performance, NFL stars took to social media to react, including the fastest receiver currently in the league: Miami Dolphins’ Tyreek Hill.
""4.2 is crazy sheesh,"" he tweeted.
Former deep threat DeSean Jackson also gave Worthy his flowers.

The Pittsburgh Steelers are sending away veteran wide receiver Diontae Johnson to the Carolina Panthers, ESPN reported Tuesday.
The Steelers are sending Johnson and a seventh-round pick to the Panthers in exchange for defensive back Donte Jackson and a sixth-round pick.
The Panthers are looking to build around quarterback Bryce Young, their No. 1 overall pick of the 2023 NFL Draft, and getting him another wide receiver this offseason was paramount after only Adam Thielen could be relied upon last year.

It was a season of lows all around for Carolina, who finished with the NFL’s worst record at 2-15. Among those lows was the worst pass attack in the league, as the Panthers averaged 161.2 yards through the air per game.
Free agents usually are not keen to signing with teams that need as much help as the Panthers do, so new GM Dan Morgan had to get creative. And he does so with a talent that has had an interesting time in Pittsburgh.
GIANTS LAND BRIAN BURNS IN TRADE WITH PANTHERS, SHELL OUT $150M EXTENSION: REPORT
Johnson has spent his first five NFL seasons with the Steelers, where he quickly became a reliable target for the now-retired Ben Roethlisberger, especially in 2021 when he caught 107 of his 169 targets for 1,161 yards and eight touchdowns. He earned his one and only Pro Bowl that year.
But since Roethlisberger left, the Steelers’ offense has been run dependent, with the team trying to find a solution at quarterback, with Kenny Pickett being drafted in the first round in 2022. He, Mitch Trubisky and Mason Rudolph never stood out, and in turn, Johnson’s numbers have dipped.
The 2023 season saw Johnson’s worst production since his rookie year, tallying 717 yards and five touchdowns over 13 games (11 starts). While he did have five touchdowns in the regular season after not scoring once in 2022, Johnson was called out for lack-of-effort plays. There was also a report that he had an altercation with safety Minkah Fitzpatrick last season.

And there were post-game comments Johnson made following some inexcusable actions against the Cincinnati Bengals in which Johnson seemed not to care about a fumble from his teammate Jaylen Warren on a run play.
""Diontae can’t let the emotions of the previous down affect his next down,"" Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin said at the time.
Johnson’s production may have seen an uptick with Russell Wilson joining the Steelers next season on a veteran-minimum contract, but he’ll instead try to build a rapport with Young.
Wilson, on the other hand, will focus on the likes of George Pickens, Pat Freiermuth, Calvin Austin and whoever else the front office may add to the receiving mix this season.

Xaviar Babudar, known better as NFL superfan ""ChiefsAholic"" for his loyalty to the Kansas City Chiefs, pleaded guilty in federal court Wednesday to numerous charges related to bank robberies.
Babudar admitted he stole more than $800,000 during 11 bank robberies across seven different states, per the U.S. Attorney’s Office. He also laundered the money through multiple casinos in the areas where he committed the robberies.
Babudar, who was very recognizable at Chiefs games with his gray wolf costume donned in Kansas City gear, pleaded guilty to one count of bank robbery, one count of money laundering and one count of transporting stolen property across state lines.

The 29-year-old faces a maximum sentence of 50 years in prison.
""His violent crime spree across the Midwest and beyond traumatized bank employees and victimized financial institutions in seven states,"" U.S. Attorney Teresa Moore said in a news release.
""The defendant tried to conceal hundreds of thousands of dollars in stolen cash by using it to gamble online and at casinos, but the odds caught up with him. With today’s conviction, he will be held accountable for the full scope of his criminal conduct, including his attempt to flee from justice.""
Babudar was initially hit with 20 charges, but the count went to three due to a plea deal.
CHIEFS SUPERFAN INDICTED ON BANK ROBBERY, MONEY LAUNDERING CHARGES
""Today was a big day for Xaviar Babudar,"" his attorney, Matthew Merryman, said per ESPN. ""He took responsibility for his actions. He stood up in court, humble and repentant, and admitted what he had done. ... Moving from 20 charges down to three charges, it was an opportunity. Xaviar Babudar would never physically harm anyone.""
Babudar is being forced to pay $532,675 in restitution as well as forfeit property gained from the robberies, which includes an autographed painting of Patrick Mahomes that was purchased at a charity auction.
Chiefs fans grew to liking Babudar’s social media presence as well as what he brought to games with his costume. ""ChiefsAholic"" on social platforms became a popular account, as he would often take shots at opposing teams.

Fans did, however, take notice of his lack of tweets during the Chiefs-Houston Texans game in December 2022. Quickly, fans made the connection to his initial arrest on Dec. 16, 2022 when he was caught after an armed robbery at the Tulsa Teachers Credit Union in Bixby, Oklahoma.
Babudar’s life on social media didn’t reflect what was going on in reality, as he was listed as homeless in court documents following that arrest.
Babudar was later released on bond, and after getting $100,000 in winnings from bets on the Chiefs, he cut off his ankle monitor and fled. He sent authorities on a hunt for nearly four months, where he was eventually found in California on July 7, 2023.
His love for the Chiefs hasn’t wavered, as ESPN reports he listened to Chiefs games on a transistor radio at Leavenworth prison in Kansas, where he’s been the past seven months.

Move on over, John Ross.
The NFL Scouting Combine is underway in Indianapolis, and prospects are showcasing their skills to 32 teams ahead of the draft.
Xavier Worthy has become a name to know at this year's combine.

The Texas Longhorn has been talked about as a second-day selection, but he only improved his draft stock with a record-breaking 40-yard dash Saturday night.
All eyes were on Worthy even beforehand since he was widely considered the fastest receiver in this class. And he proved it.
His first attempt was a blazing 4.25. On his second attempt, he tied Ross's record with an unofficial 4.22.
But when officials reviewed the run, they reduced his time by a hundredth of a second, making his official time 4.21, a new 40-yard dash record.
Some of the NFL's biggest stars, including noted speeder Tyreek Hill, chimed in.
In his third and final season at Texas, Worthy posted career highs with 75 receptions for 1,014 yards. In his career, he had 197 catches for 2,755 yards and 26 touchdowns.

Worthy's bugaboos have been his small frame (he's only 160 pounds) and his drop issues, but game-breaking speed like his could outweigh those negatives.
His Longhorns won the Big 12, which earned them a trip to the College Football Playoff, but they lost to Washington, Ross's alma mater, in the Sugar Bowl. The Huskies eventually lost to Michigan, where Worthy initially committed.
Worthy was named to the Big 12 first team last season, his second such nod. He also made the first team in 2021 and the second team in 2022.

The NCAA is barred from enforcing its rules prohibiting name, image and likeness compensation from being used to recruit athletes in Tennessee and Virginia.
U.S. District Judge Clifton Corker in the Eastern District of Tennessee made the ruling on Friday, saying the NCAA's stance likely violates antitrust law with Congress so far unwilling to give the association an exemption.
The attorneys general for the states filed an antitrust lawsuit several weeks ago.

""This is the beginning of whatever the new order of college sports is, but there had to be a fresh start,"" Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti told OutKick's ""Hot Mic."" ""What we had wasn't working, and this is what it took to start the ball rolling in the next direction. . . .

The NCAA said the decision will ""aggravate an already chaotic collegiate environment, further diminishing protection for student-athletes from exploitation.""
""The NCAA fully supports student-athletes making money from their name, image and likeness and is making changes to deliver more benefits to student-athletes, but an endless patchwork of state laws and court opinions make clear partnering with Congress is necessary to provide stability for the future of all college athletes.""

San Francisco Giants manager Bob Melvin wants his players to pour out of the dugout and stand for the national anthem before spring training games.
Melvin, who took over the team in the offseason after spending two seasons with the San Diego Padres, told The Athletic that he wants to show his opponents that his players are ready to play. The team is required to abide by Melvin’s rule and the manager hopes it will carry into the regular season.

""It’s all about the perception that we’re out there ready to play,"" he told the outlet. ""That’s it. You want your team ready to play, and I want the other team to notice it, too. It’s really as simple as that.""
Melvin has maintained that his rule has nothing to do with politics, but it’s a stark contrast from what was seen under Gabe Kapler.
Kapler, who managed the Giants from 2020 to just near the end of the 2023 season, refused to stand on the field for the national anthem in the wake of the 2022 Uvalde, Texas, school shootings. According to The Athletic, there was ""no wrong answer"" to how players handled the anthem.

""It has nothing to do with whatever happened in the past or whatever, it’s just something I embrace.""
The players seemed to have embraced the rule.
""I think it sets the example of hey, we’re in this together,"" Giants outfielder Austin Slater told The Athletic. ""Whether you’re not playing that day or you’re a starting pitcher who threw yesterday, you’re still out there, on time, ready to be a good teammate.""

"March 8, 2024 1:37pm EST","NFL stars Kirk Cousins, Saquon Barkley, Chris Jones expected to make a big splash in free agency market",Fox News,"Fox Sports NFL insider Jay Glazer breaks down Taylor Swift's impact on football ratings on 'One Nation.'
Kirk Cousins will be a free agent for the first time since the Vikings gave him the first fully guaranteed quarterback deal in the NFL. Baker Mayfield is expected to stay put in Tampa Bay. Russell Wilson has to make another move. Joe Flacco could find a new home, too.
The quarterback carousel will start spinning when the NFL’s free agency period opens Monday with the legal tampering period. Players can’t officially sign new deals until the opening of the league’s new year on Wednesday.
While the quarterbacks get much of the attention, many of the best players available play other positions.
49ERS' DEEBO SAMUEL DELIVERS HARD TRUTH ON LOSING 2 SUPER BOWLS IN 5 YEARS
All-Pro defensive tackle Chris Jones heads a list that includes fellow defensive tackle Christian Wilkins, edge rushers Danielle Hunter, Chase Young and Jonathan Greenard, safeties Justin Simmons and Xavier McKinney, cornerbacks Xavien Howard and Tre’Davious White, linebackers Patrick Queen and Lavonte David, and many others.

There’s also plenty of talented guys on the offensive side, including running backs Saquon Barkley, Derrick Henry, Josh Jacobs and D’Andre Swift, offensive tackles Tyron Smith, Jonah Williams and Trent Brown, wide receivers Calvin Ridley, Marquise Brown and Odell Beckham Jr., and more.
Eight players received the non-exclusive franchise tag, including wide receivers Tee Higgins and Michael Pittman, edge rusher Josh Allen and All-Pro safety Antoine Winfield. They can still test the open market, but teams would have to give up a pair of first-round picks to sign them.
Jones will have an opportunity to cash in after helping Kansas City win its third Super Bowl in five years. The Chiefs tagged cornerback L’Jarius Sneed instead of placing it on Jones for the second straight season.
Jones’ price tag will likely exceed the $95 million, three-year deal eight-time All-Pro DT Aaron Donald got from the Los Angeles Rams in 2022.
The Chiefs already made it clear re-signing Jones is a top priority. They can get Sneed back for at least one year for the $19.8 million tag, give him a long-term deal or trade him.
3-TIME PRO BOWLER TAYLOR LEWAN ‘DID NOT GET A GOOD VIBE’ FROM POTENTIAL NO. 1 PICK CALEB WILLIAMS AT COMBINE
Half of the NFL’s teams have more than $30 million available in salary cap, making it a player-friendly market to a certain degree.
There’s much interest in how the running backs will fare.
Barkley, Jacobs and Tony Pollard received franchise tags last season but no team wanted to commit $11.9 million to its running back. Austin Ekeler rounds out the top six.
The Giants seem ready to move on from Barkley, who should get interest from plenty of teams, including a pair of New York’s NFC East rivals. The Eagles will be looking for a running back at the right price, of course, if they don’t retain Swift, who is coming off his first 1,000-yard season. Barkley would be an upgrade for the Cowboys over Pollard.
Henry is 30 but he ran for 1,167 yards and scored 12 touchdowns in 2023 and has had five 1,000-yard seasons in the last six years. He’d be a better fit for a Super Bowl contender than Tennessee.
NFL teams have undervalued the running back position to the point where they have the lowest franchise tag number among the skill players. Wide receivers are now nearly $10 million higher at $21.8 million.
""I think that, at the end of the day, talented players end up getting paid,"" Eagles general manager Howie Roseman said. ""So, I think everyone will kind of have value on players just like any other position. Obviously, those guys handle the ball a lot, and they’re important players.""
Nobody gets paid quite like the quarterbacks, whose franchise tag is $38.3 million.
Cousins, a four-time Pro Bowl pick, is coming off a torn an Achilles tendon that ended his season in October.
Minnesota wants him back and he prefers to stay there but there’s a possibility another QB-needy team like Atlanta steals him away.
Mayfield revived his career with the Buccaneers, had his best all-around season and led the team to the second round of the playoffs. Now, he’s set to cash in. Tampa Bay already re-signed wide receiver Mike Evans and tagged Winfield. They plan to keep Mayfield, who loves playing in the city.
XAVIER WORTHY, NEW 40-YARD DASH RECORD HOLDER, REVEALS WHO HE 'MODELED MY GAME AFTER'
""Well, it didn’t take long for me to realize just what a great dude he was and what a great teammate he was,"" Buccaneers GM Jason Licht said of Mayfield. ""As the season went on more and more, how important it was for him to set an example of what we’re trying to be as a team, and that’s a tough team, that endures adversity, but also a physical tone setter out on the field. Typically, it’s not a good recipe to have your quarterback trying to run over linebackers and be the tone setter, but he’s willing to do whatever it takes to win. So, it’s a selfless nature of his.""
Wilson already was informed the Broncos will release him after two seasons in Denver. The Falcons, Steelers and Raiders are his most likely landing spots. If the Vikings lose Cousins, they’d have to consider Wilson. The Patriots could view him as a stopgap if they don’t take a QB with the No. 3 overall pick in the draft or prefer to let a rookie QB start the season on the sideline.
Justin Fields is another big-name quarterback expected to switch teams, though Chicago will have to trade him. The Bears have the No. 1 pick and it would be a shocker if they don’t take Caleb Williams.
More quality players could become available over the weekend as teams continue to manage their salary caps.
The frenzy begins Monday. Just one month after the Chiefs beat the 49ers in the Super Bowl, the NFL is set to dominate the headlines again.

However, Joshua dominated this one from the start, knocking Ngannou to the canvas in round one.

New York Rangers rookie Matt Rempe has only played in 10 games this season, but he was slapped with a four-game suspension on Tuesday for elbowing New Jersey Devils defenseman Jonas Siegenthaler.
Rempe has been characterized as an enforcer since he was called up to the Rangers. He has been in four fights since he got a chance to play in the NHL. His play earned him 54 penalty minutes while only having about 56:28 of time on the ice.

His hit on Siegenthaler earned him a five-minute major penalty and a game misconduct. The NHL’s Department of Player Safety issued the suspension after a disciplinary hearing.

The league said Rempe flared his left below up and out in a dangerous fashion to hit Siegenthaler in order to make contact instead of trying to miss him. To make matters worse, Siegenthaler was injured on the play and did not return to the game.
Devils defenseman Kurtis MacDermid tried to challenge Rempe, but officials separated the two.
""I wish I could have gotten to him sooner and taught him a lesson,"" MacDermid said.

""There's a right way to go about things and a wrong way,"" MacDermid added. ""He’s a young kid in this league. He has a lot to learn still. You don’t do things like that when you’re in your first year in league especially ... You've got to learn how to hit properly and not injure players.""

A weekend of drama in Formula One is sometimes more than enough for any race fan.

Pin received a drive-through penalty after the second race after she failed to realize the second race was over. She crossed the finish line twice at full speed until the red flag waved, according to F1’s website. She received a 20-second penalty to be added to her elapsed race time. Instead of finishing in first, she dropped to ninth.
Abbi Pulling, of Alpine, finished first after Pin’s penalty was assessed.
""An unfortunate end to an incredible first weekend in F1 Academy, the team and the car were amazing, but a post race penalty drops me to P9,"" Pin wrote on Instagram Sunday. ""Will come back even stronger in Miami. Congrats to @abbipulling on P1.""

Pin had the fastest times of the weekend. She was on the pole after the second round of qualifying and finished the first race at 26:50.962.
The second event of the season is scheduled for Miami May 2-4. The F1 Academy will run two races.

For the second time ever, the NFLPA surveyed players across the league to get a better understanding of their workplace environments with the hopes of improving their overall working conditions.
Data collected from the second annual NFL Player Team Report Cards were released this week and included feedback from 1,706 players throughout the league – which equates to more than a 77% response rate, a significant increase from last year’s 60%.

NFLPA President JC Tretter explained in a note on the union’s website that the goal of the survey is not only to highlight the positives of each club but to also identify areas of improvement and educate its members.

""Progress rarely comes as fast as you would like, but we are encouraged by how many teams made substantial improvements in the wake of last year’s results. Overall, players responded to those changes positively, which is reflected in many of the grades for those clubs,"" Tretter wrote.
The survey was conducted from Aug. 26 to Nov. 16 and was based on results in 11 different categories.
Read below for more on the results and this year’s biggest takeaways.

In one of the least surprising results from the survey, Kansas City Chiefs head coach Andy Reid was selected as the highest-rated coach – a ""bright spot"" on a rather poor report card overall.
""The Kansas City Chiefs come in second to last place among NFL clubs in this year's survey,"" the report said of the Chiefs’ overview. ""The one bright spot for the team is head coach Andy Reid, who was the highest rated head coach in the NFL. Other than that, the players are frustrated by their workplace offerings, especially after the team's sustained success in recent years.""
Owner Clark Hunt, who received an F-minus ranking in the report, addressed the failing grades the organization received for their nutritionist/dietitian, locker room and training staff when speaking to a small group of reporters on Wednesday.
""I have not had a chance to see the report,"" he said, per the Associated Press. ""I mentioned the practice facility is something we're going to continue to think about. It's coming up on 20 years. We've certainly in a lot of ways outgrown it, and we recognize we need to expand it and modernize it.""
For Reid’s part, it’s no surprise that players ranked him among the best. He boasts a 128-51 record in the regular season since joining the organization in 2013. Kansas City has won the division for the last eight years and has won three Super Bowls in the last five seasons, including two straight.

The Cincinnati Bengals ranked in the top 10 in the head coach, strength coaches, weight room and training room categories but finished last in three other categories, including food/cafeteria.
According to the survey, the Bengals are just one of two teams in the league that don’t provide their players with three meals a day and only recently began doing so on Wednesdays. They are also the only team that closes the cafeteria on players’ day off, despite some showing up for extra training on those days.
They also rank 30th overall in food taste and 31st overall in food freshness.
The organization also ranked 32nd in the treatment of families and nutritionist/dietitian.
The Bengals did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment.

The Washington Commanders caught heat last season after it was reported that the locker rooms had no hot water after a game against the New York Giants. But the NFLPA survey revealed that there were more issues with the team’s facilities outside that one incident.
According to the report, the Commanders received an F-minus grade for the locker room, with just 19% of players saying they feel that the locker room itself is big enough and 26% saying they have enough room in their individual lockers.
""Players also mention issues with cleanliness, citing multiple sewage leaks this season,"" the report added.
The Commanders overall ranked 32nd with minor improvement from last year since Josh Harris purchased the team in July.
""The organization received low marks across the board last year, so there is no shortage of issues that need marked improvement after years of neglect. The one bright spot for the club is the players’ ranking of the Commanders’ strength coaches, with 98% of player respondents saying that they get the best possible individualized plan,"" the report states.
Washington continues to endure changes under its new ownership with FedEx ending its naming rights agreement with the stadium on Wednesday. A potential replacement home is also still an option, with Harris’ group still considering options in Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia.
The Commanders declined to comment on the survey data, but the team recently announced plans to spend $75 million on both stadium and facility upgrades and hired a consultant late last season to evaluate player wellness operations.

""The club owner’s ranking reflects the strong performance in key areas that players care about, including the quality of their facilities, the comfort of players’ travel, and the quality and quantity of staff across multiple categories.""
The Dolphins' lowest grade was an A-minus and players gave Ross a rating of 9.9/10 ""when considering his willingness to invest in the facilities.""

The biggest issue plaguing the New England Patriots players surrounds the team’s weight room.
According to the survey data, the organization ranks 32nd overall in this category. It is the only team in the league where the majority of players feel that the team’s facility ""is worse than places they could train offsite.""
They also rank 32nd overall in the quality of their weight room equipment and space.
""The players feel the facility has needed significant renovations for a while now, which explains the low grade for club owner Robert Kraft on the question about players having confidence he will invest in their facilities,"" the report states.

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico – Some might not want to hear it, but Jake Paul might just be the face of boxing.

A month after members of the notorious Gotti family allegedly got into a brawl at a high school basketball game, they are still fighting.
However, this time, they will be fighting in court, as they rejected a plea deal regarding assault charges from that melee.
Kimberly and Gianna Gotti, the daughter and granddaughter of infamous mobster John Gotti, shot down a plea that they would exchange assault charges in exchange for 12 weeks of anger management and an order of protection for the victim.

The mother-daughter duo were alleged to have cursed at students during the game. The mob boss' grandson was playing for Oyster Bay High School in nearby Locust Valley on Long Island.
The victim said she confronted both Kimberly and Gianna, asking them to stop, but then, they both allegedly punched her.
""At that point, I felt my hair being pulled and felt my wig come off, which was held on by three clips and Velcro,"" the victim said in her complaint, via Newsday. ""I allowed my head to go back because I felt as if my scalp was going to be ripped off, and I observed the lady in the gray jacket pulling my hair.""
The victim suffered from ""substantial pain to her scalp and bruises to both sides of her face.""
""This lady just went wild. She was uncontrollable,"" the Gottis' attorney, Gerard Michael Mattone, said, via the New York Post. ""Security could not throw her out, and then when she was finally thrown out, she kept coming back into the gymnasium to start more trouble with the Gotti family.""

""Because the Gottis don’t press charges, my client and her daughter wound up getting arrested. And that’s OK. Because we’ll find it [out] in court.""
The Gottis were also accused of using homophobic slurs, which they have denied.
John Gotti Jr. said the woman ""assaulted my wife first,"" and Mattone claimed the woman had made fun of Kimberly's son.

The Jimmy Garoppolo era in Las Vegas is over.
Just 12 months after signing a three-year deal with the Raiders, Garoppolo was released Wednesday, making him a free agent.
The Raiders had signed Garoppolo to a three-year, $72.75 million contract last offseason to replace the departed Derek Carr, but the move backfired almost from the start.

Garoppolo's contract had to be reworked when he failed a physical and needed surgery on his previously injured foot, and he never reached the success he had in San Francisco after getting healthy.
The Raiders benched Garoppolo midway through last season after Antonio Pierce took over for fired coach Josh McDaniels. With Pierce, the Raiders went 5-4, and after many players pleaded to have him back, the Raiders dropped his interim tag to make him their official head coach.
Before signing with the Raiders, Garoppolo had a roller coaster tenure with the San Francisco 49ers.

CHIEFS PRESIDENT SAYS 'LEAVING KANSAS CITY' IS AN 'OPTION' AMID STADIUM TAX VOTE
Garoppolo was the guy under center in the Bay Area until Trey Lance was selected with the third overall pick in 2021. Lance sat for a year before becoming the starter, and Garoppolo returned to the Niners in 2022 on a one-year deal. After an ankle injury in Week 2 ended Lance's season in 2022, Garoppolo was back under center.
But Garoppolo got injured, giving Brock Purdy a chance, and the rest is history.
Garoppolo was also suspended for two games in the upcoming season for violating the NFL's performance-enhancement substance policy last month.
As the Niners starter, Garoppolo went to three NFC championships and a Super Bowl. With Vegas, he made just six starts, throwing for 1,205 yards, nine interceptions and seven touchdowns before getting benched after the coaching change.

One of the top safeties is reportedly off the free agent market, as the Green Bay Packers and former New York Giants defensive captain Xavier McKinney agreed to terms on a four-year deal, his agent David Mulugheta told ESPN.
McKinney’s deal with the Packers will be $68 million over four years.
He replaces multiple Packers safeties on the market this offseason, including Darnell Savage, who agreed to a three-year deal with the Jacksonville Jaguars earlier on Monday, the start of the NFL’s legal free agency tampering period.

McKinney all but confirmed the deal on X, where he posted, ""Say cheese!"" in reference to the Packers' ""cheesehead"" fans.
The Packers have Jonathan Owens and Rudy Ford, two safeties who played significant snaps last season, as free agents.
McKinney, a second-round pick by the Giants in 2020, was not hit with the franchise tag this offseason, suggesting GM Joe Schoen was going to let him go find a new home in the NFL.
GIANTS LEGEND TIKI BARBER BASHES SAQUON BARKLEY'S EAGLES DECISION: ‘YOU’RE DEAD TO ME'
This comes after McKinney set a career-high in tackles with 116 combined last season with three interceptions, 11 passes defended and one forced fumble. He also had two fumble recoveries for New York in a lackluster 2023 campaign that followed a playoff berth in 2022.
McKinney infamously missed eight games during that 2022 season after an ATV accident in Cabo during the team’s bye week caused a hand injury.

He ended up returning in time to play against the Minnesota Vikings in the wild-card round, where he made the game-sealing tackle on tight end T.J. Hockenson late in the fourth quarter.
McKinney’s start with the Giants wasn’t the best, as a foot injury kept him out most of his rookie season. But he exploded on the scene in 2021, totaling five interceptions (one for pick-six), 92 tackles and 10 passes defended.
He now joins a Packers team that’s primed to build on its 2023 season, which saw a wild-card berth turn into a massive upset of the Dallas Cowboys on the road in the playoffs. Led by quarterback Jordan Love, the Packers almost beat the San Francisco 49ers in the divisional round.

The Packers have a new defensive coordinator in place this season, Jeff Hafley, who will certainly enjoy the talents McKinney can offer his secondary.
McKinney was one of two key Giants that left in free agency, with running back Saquon Barkley agreeing to a three-year deal to join the Philadelphia Eagles.

Pat McAfee has become one of the most infamous figures in sports media today.
He inked a five-year, $85 million deal with ESPN last year so the network could broadcast his daily show, parlayed into becoming a ""College GameDay"" analyst.
But it's his show, McAfee admits, where he has gotten into ""some s--t.""

Jimmy Kimmel and Aaron Rodgers' feud went to the next level. (Getty Images)
Aaron Rodgers has long been a guest on the show, and it's where the four-time MVP has turned plenty of heads.
The four-time MVP made plenty waves when picking fights with Dr. Anthony Fauci, Travis Kelce, and Keith Olbermann about COVID-19 vaccines, but the show gained notoriety when Rodgers took it a step further with his quip about Jimmy Kimmel and Jeffrey Epstein.
""People were thinking we're gonna get kicked off ESPN this year already. People were already assuming that it's not gonna work, it's not gonna last, because Aaron started a war with Jimmy Kimmel on our show,"" McAfee told the ""All The Smoke"" podcast with former NBA stars Matt Barnes and Stephen Jackson. ""Jimmy Kimmel obviously ABC, all the COVID stuff, calling out Fauci on our show, there was a lot. The block got real hot for about three weeks.""
McAfee, of course, was referencing when Rodgers said Kimmel should be ""hoping"" that the Epstein client list wouldn't come out - the consensus was that Rodgers had insinuated that Kimmel would be on the list, but Rodgers denied that was the case.
McAfee didn't exactly do himself any favors when he said that a high-ranking ESPN executive was ""sabotaging"" his show and was ""canceled by both parties."" But in any case, McAfee defended his friend: ""The stuff Aaron's talking about, he's very passionate about. Aaron firmly believes that,"" he said.

But Rodgers' controversial opinions have not only made himself an enemy in the public eye, but McAfee as well. McAfee admitted he didn't quite understand everything Rodgers was saying, which led him to doubt he even deserved a show.
""There was a lot of times where I’m like, ‘Do I deserve to have this platform if I don’t know everything about everything so this s–-t can’t happen and people don’t end up hating us?' … Because there was nights I couldn’t sleep. Like I’m like, ‘Maybe I am f--king this up completely.’""
But McAfee had an epiphany.
""We're having conversations with people. You can disagree with them completely, but at least you learned and know where Aaron's at. This is a Mt. Rushmore quarterback in the history of the NFL - in real time, you're leaning about him completely. I feel like that's a form of journalism as well, even though people won't really talk about it. . . .

Wembanyama needed merely 31 minutes to reach the requirements for the 5x5 game. The Spurs dropped Friday night's game in Los Angeles, despite Wembanyama's outstanding performance. San Antonio has now loss three straight games and sits in last place in the Western Conference.

While Wembanyama certainly seems to appreciate the accolades he has received in the early portion of his NBA career, but he remains focused on trying to win games.
""To me, it's secondary,"" Wembanyama said. ""Hopefully in the future, and think this is a good performance, but as of today, I can't be satisfied with a loss.""
Wembanyama also acknowledged the challenge of competing against an all-time great player in LeBron James and his star teammate Anthony Davis.
""Of course it was challenging [going against] one of the best duos in the league,"" Wembanyama said. ""But still, I think it's a lot of teams we beat if we play this way.
""But I think it came down to maturity at the end because each and every one of us was making a mistake each of the times. Little mistakes, missing a layup, turning the ball over. We went down, we went back to down four, down seven multiple times, and that's when we did mistakes. So yeah, it's maturity.""

James, a four-time NBA champion, spoke highly of Wembanyama calling the rookie ""special.""
""He doesn't have a ceiling,"" James said. ""He can do whatever he wants to do with his career. It seems like he enjoys the game. It seems like he puts in the work. Just from the outside looking in, I'm not with him on a day-to-day basis, but I said a long time ago how special he was, and it's literally that simple.
""As far as your question as far as havoc [defensively], there are guys in our league that you have to account for any time you get around the rim or around the perimeter in our league history, and he sits right at the top of it, [if not] around the top, with all the greats.""

"March 7, 2024 6:45am EST","Ex-MLB star Adam Wainwright reveals feelings on pitch clock, universal DH as stellar career ends",Fox News,"Former St. Louis Cardinals star Adam Wainwright talks to Fox News Digital about the pitch clock and universal DH.
Adam Wainwright was one of the rare players in Major League Baseball who spent his entire career with one team. And he pitched for so long he got to see firsthand how the game evolved, starting from the mid-2000s to the early 2020s.
MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred and the players union instituted a pitch clock and enacted a universal designated hitter among other rules. Wainwright pitched in the majors for the St. Louis Cardinals, from 2005 to 2023, after the team acquired him from the Atlanta Braves in December 2003.
He was a World Series champion with St. Louis in 2006 and was on the team in 2011 when it won another title, though he didn’t pitch during the year due to injury. Additionally, he was a Silver Slugger and a three-time All-Star. He retired from the majors after the 2023 season.

Wainwright is now more focused on spending time at home with his wife and children, and the singer-songwriter is gearing up to perform at the Grand Ole Opry Saturday in Nashville.
He talked to Fox News Digital about the evolution of the sport, including having to adjust to the pitch clock.
""The pitch clock was a little bit more of an adjustment than I thought,"" he said. ""I’m a pitcher that likes to work fast. So, I thought it wasn’t going to bother me a whole lot. But, you know, there’s moments in the game … where I wish I could call time just to have a few seconds to think about something because a hitter comes up third (in his) at-bat.
""And you got all these sequences in your head already. And, now, I’m thinking, ‘All right, I could start him here, I could go there,’ but you only got 15 seconds.
""Now, you got the catcher whose doing the sign in your ear with the PitchCom. So, you’re trying to think all this, and you got fastball, curveball, slider, and you’re like, ‘Just wait a second, you know.’""
Wainwright said most of the time when he threw a pitch and saw a reaction he knew exactly how he would approach the rest of the at-bat.
He told Fox News Digital he would like to see MLB tweak the pitch clock rules and have pitchers be able to call timeouts with nobody on base.

""We don’t need to get too fast because you get to a game, you want to sit down and have a drink, get a hot dog, get some popcorn,"" he explained. ""You still want to be able to sit there and enjoy it. But I do think the pitch clock was a good thing in many ways. It was getting a little slow.""
Starting with the 2022 season, the designated hitter was added to the National League as part of the collective bargaining agreement.
On the surface, it may have seemed like a good thing for Wainwright. He ruptured an Achilles early in the 2015 season while batting. He was able to make it back in time to finish out the season.

He told Fox News Digital he enjoyed batting and pitching.
""For me, the best feeling in the world was pitching a nine-inning game, pitching a whole game and getting clay all over me from being on the bases,"" he said. ""That was like my dream come true. I got to be Shohei (Ohtani) a couple of times in my career, and that was fun.""
Wainwright finished his career with a 3.53 ERA, 2,202 strikeouts and 200 wins. At the plate, he was a .192 lifetime hitter in 848 plate appearances with 10 home runs, 39 doubles and two triples.
As he takes on a new role in life, he told Fox News Digital he’s enjoying being at home.

NFL MVP Cam Newton appears to have gotten into a brawl during a 7-on-7 football event this weekend.
Video has gone viral on social media of Newton, the former Carolina Panthers and New England Patriots quarterback, getting into an altercation with several men apparently from Top Shelf Performance, who had teams playing in the first ""We Ball Sports"" 7v7 tournament in Atlanta before the fight was ultimately broken up.
Newton's ""C1N"" 7v7 team was also participating in the event.

It's unknown how the fight started, but it began under a pop-up tent that was seen at the top of a football field. It eventually spilled over to a fence, where Newton was seen not letting go of someone as people tried to break the fight up.
Then a man in a white T-shirt came in and threw a big punch, though it didn't appear anyone got severely injured. A security officer ended up jumping in the middle of things, too, as everyone started to disperse.
Instagram Stories of Newton's ""C1N"" team account show him wearing the all-black outfit with a top hat, which was also seen in the video.
NFL THREATENING SIGNIFICANT PUNISHMENT FOR FIGHTS THAT OCCUR BEFORE AND DURING GAMES: REPORT
The altercation may have stemmed from a certain Newton video in which he said, ""If you beat my team – 15U C1N Red or 18UC1N Platinum – I will pay every single player on the team. Tell me who's doing that. If that ain't putting your money where your mouth is, I don't know what to say.""
This comment came before this tournament, but it's something that Newton has said in the past.

""We need that up out ya @cameron1newton or you can write a check payable too [sic] @topshelf7v7,"" TopShelf Performance's general manager, Steph Brown, wrote on his Instagram Story on Saturday.
He added a different post on his Stories that read, ""It Ain't No Fun When the [rabbit emoji] Got the [watergun emoji,"" while tagging C1N's 7v7 team account.

"February 25, 2024 10:40am EST",Nets owner Joe Tsai says NBA's relationship with China 'in a very good place',Fox News,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Could the NBA and China once again be in a good-standing relationship? One NBA owner with high influence overseas seems to think so.
Brooklyn Nets owner Joe Tsai, the co-founder and chairman of Chinese e-commerce Giant Alibaba, told CNBC that the league is ""in a very good place"" with China despite their rocky situation these past few years.
Four years ago, Houston Rockets' then-executive Daryl Morey tweeted that he stood with Hong Kong, supporting the anti-government protests that were taking place there.

Enraged by the support, China announced its ""condemnation"" of Morey’s tweet, while cutting ties with the Rockets. At the time, the Los Angeles Lakers were also set to play in Shanghai and Shenzhen.
The 300 million NBA fans who reside in China were cut off from the NBA, which commissioner Adam Silver said cost the league around $400 million in 2021.
But Tsai, whose team was the last to play in China in 2019, sees the relationship mending.
ENES KANTER FREEDOM SAYS NBA ‘RUN BY THE CHINESE DICTATORSHIP’ AFTER EXECUTIVE RECORDINGS SURFACE
""I think the NBA is in a very good place with respect to its relationship with China,"" Tsai said, per Reuters. ""China is actually the NBA’s biggest fan base. So what happened before, I think it’s water under the bridge.""
Tsai added the NBA would ""love"" to get back to China and Macau to play games for their vast international audience.

""I think just having the fans have real, in-person sort of interaction with the stars. I think that’s going to be important,"" Tsai said.
The NBA’s relationship with China has been a sore spot for some in recent years, as it’s been reported league owners all allegedly have over $10 billion invested in China.
Enes Kanter Freedom, a former NBA center who has publicly ridiculed the league for its Chinese relationship, called out Silver for purportedly cozying up to the Chinese Communist Party, while turning a blind eye to the human rights abuses and treatment of Uyghur Muslims in the country.
This came after a video from the Washington Wizards showed Chinese Ambassador Qin Gang shooting free throws.
""I have been playing 11 years in NBA and over 800 games,"" he said in 2022. ""I have never, ever in my whole career [seen] any ambassador of any government that takes the court before or after the game and takes free shots.

""I’ll miss my team, my coaches. I’ll miss the moments sitting with my father on the practice court bench. The handshakes – win or lose – and the athletes, whether they knew it or not, who pushed me to be my best.""
In more than 800 matches, she finished with a 645-171 record, 36 WTA titles and four ITF titles. She was briefly suspended in 2016 for testing positive for a WADA banned substance and the organization determined she ""bore some degree of fault"" over it.

"February 22, 2024 6:02am EST",Former official William Bock on NCAA's transgender athlete policies: 'What is happening to women is unethical',Fox News,"Former NCAA official William Bock III talks to OutKick's ""Gaines for Girls"" podcast about his decision to resign from the organization.
William Bock III wrote a resignation letter to NCAA President Charlie Baker last week, claiming he was stepping down from his position on the Division I Committee on Infractions due to the organization’s current policy on transgender athletes.
Bock said in the letter that the current policies harm women and deprive them of ""competitive opportunities"" in their respective sports.
Bock spoke with OutKick’s Riley Gaines on her ""Gaines for Girls"" podcast, where he went more in-depth about why he believed he needed to resign.

""Since the Lia Thomas situation had arisen, tried to take my time on the committee to have a lot of conversations with people to learn more about the NCAA's policies and also to watch closely its leadership, which transferred from Mark Emmert to Charlie Baker about a year or so ago,"" Bock told Gaines.
""I was very hopeful when Mr. Baker, the former governor of Massachusetts, had assumed the office because he has a reputation for fairness. And understand, he has a daughter that played high school sports. So, I was hoping there would be a fresh look at this issue, but it became apparent, and is apparent because the rules have only been cosmetically changed, that no change was going to happen.""
Bock knows all about competitive fairness, having served as the general counsel for the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency for almost 14 years. He noted in the letter that he joined the NCAA Division I Committee on Infractions in 2016 to make sure protecting and promoting ""a level playing field in college sports"" was happening.
NCAA OFFICIAL HANDS IN RESIGNATION LETTER OVER ‘REGRESSIVE POLICIES’ ON TRANSGENDER ATHLETES
""Although I may not have agreed with the wisdom of every rule in the NCAA rulebook, I believed the intent behind the NCAA’s rules was competitive fairness and protection of equal opportunities for student-athletes,"" Bock’s letter read.
The NCAA adopted a sport-by-sport policy, some of which included participation metrics based on testosterone levels – something Bock does not approve of.

""So, the committee I was on was supposed to be about ethical sport,"" Bock told Gaines. ""What is happening to women is unethical. It's discriminatory. It's, I believe, a violation of Title IX protections for women. But it violates the fundamental tenet of sport, which is competitive fairness. If you don't have competitive fairness, you don't have true sport.
""At that point, I had realized that I needed to just make it very clear I couldn't continue in that role given their unwillingness to change those polices.""
The NCAA states that the sport-by-sport policy ""preserves opportunity for transgender student-athletes while balancing fairness, inclusion and safety for all who compete.""
By Aug. 1, 2024, all sports in the NCAA will require transgender student-athletes to ""provide documentation no less than twice annually (and at least once within four weeks of competition in NCAA championships) that meets the sport-specific standard (which may include testosterone levels, mitigation timelines and other aspects of sport-governing body policies) as reviewed and approved by CSMAS.""

""The NCAA cannot succeed in achieving ethical sport so long as it endorses a policy of discrimination against female student-athletes,"" Bock wrote in his letter to Baker.

"February 28, 2024 6:18am EST",Illinois' Brad Underwood says 'there has to be a plan' to get players to safety during court-storming,Fox News,"Illinois men's basketball head coach Brad Underwood addressed the issue of court-storming on Tuesday on OutKick's ""Don't @ Me with Dan Dakich.""
Duke basketball star Kyle Filipowski found himself nursing his knee after Wake Forest fans rushed the floor following the Demon Deacons' recent win over the eighth-ranked Blue Devils. Shortly after an on-court collision left him hobbled, Filipowski called for more protection for the players.
""Just trying to get my way off the court, and you know, you’ve got these crazy college students just doing whatever they want. It’s got to be a little more protective when things like that happen,"" the Duke star noted.
Court-storming has been widely discussed in the days since Duke's visit to Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Illinois coach Brad Underwood recently joined OutKick's ""Don’t @ Me with Dan Dakich"", and while he did not completely object to students and fans rushing the court, he did echo Filipowski's sentiments about implementing more advanced protective measures.

Underwood acknowledged that Illinois fans have sprinted onto the court following a big win. He also noted that a ""fine line"" certainly exists when it comes to thousands of excited fans wanting to storm a basketball court.
""We've done (court-storming) here. We've had it done to us. The thing that scares me the most today is we have so much anger and hate sometimes that somebody is really going to get hurt … and I think that's where we really have to be sensitive.""
""To me college is about creating memories and so many memories coming from sporting events … so it's a fine line.""

Filipowski recalled how he felt the moment of the collusion and said he believed the physical contact that left him injured was ""intentional.""
""I felt a bunch of hits on my body,"" Filipowski told WFMY-TV about the events that resulted in a knee injury. ""This one was the worst of them. Like I said, it's just really ridiculous how, you know, that situation's handled. I've already heard that there (are) some videos of (me) getting punched in the back, so I absolutely feel like it was personal, intentional for sure. There's no reason why they see a big guy like me trying to work my way off the court and can't work their way around me. There's no excuse for that.""

While it is unclear whether the fan's contact was malicious, one of the videos Filipowski may have been referring to appeared to show the moment he was injured as Wake Forest fans stampeded toward center court. An alternate angle of the scene shows multiple fans near the free-throw line before the game clock officially hit zero.
The Atlantic Coast Conference requires member schools to have detailed safety procedures in place for managing court-stormings. However, it historically has not levied fines, something four of the six major basketball conferences do for a first offense — such as the Southeastern Conference issuing a $100,000 penalty on LSU after its fans stormed the court following last week’s win over a ranked Kentucky team.
It is unclear whether the ACC will fine Wake Forest.

Later Saturday night, Wake Forest athletics director John Currie issued a statement saying he had expressed ""regret"" for the incident to Duke athletics director Nina King as well as to Atlantic Coast Conference senior associate commissioner Paul Brazeau.

According to the AP, Pollard’s failing health is due to a genetic condition that was likely triggered by a virus he contracted in 2021. The condition was causing his heart to beat an extra 10,000 times a day. It is the same condition that his father, who passed away when Pollard was 16, had.
One of the biggest challenges facing Pollard was finding a heart that could support his 6-foot-11, 260-pound body.

Shortly after going public with his health update, Pollard had found a match.
""Every single thing that could be different is different,"" Pollard said on social media Thursday.
""When I woke from probably the most difficult surgery around, I immediately felt better. That told me two things: 1) the staff at @VUMCTransplant is incredible and 2) I was thinking I was ok. I wasn’t.""

A first-round draft pick out of Kansas in 1997, Pollard played for five NBA teams across 11 seasons, most notably with the Kings and the Indiana Pacers. He retired in 2008 after one year with the Boston Celtics.

"February 24, 2024 5:14pm EST",Duke star Kyle Filipowski injured after Wake Forest fans storm court; coach calls for 'ban',Fox News,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Wake Forest fans added injury to insult when they stormed the court following the Demon Deacons' 83-79 upset victory over No. 8 Duke Saturday afternoon.
With the court flooded with black, white and gold attire after the final buzzer, Duke star Kyle Filipowski had to be helped off the court.
It appeared a fan made contact with him running from the left side of the court. The fan who appeared to hit Filipowski fell to the court, and Filipowski somehow ended up in the arms of Duke staff.

As Filipowski made his way off the court, a fan filming the chaos on his phone wagged his finger Dikembe Mutombo-style.
One of the Blue Devils' staff members helping Filipowski off the floor appeared to tell fans to ""get the f--- out of the way.""
Head coach Jon Scheyer said Filipowski sprained his ankle, and the coach called for court storming to end.
""When are we going to ban court storming? When are we going to ban that? How many times does a player have to get into something where they get punched, or they get pushed, or they get taunted right in their face? It's a dangerous thing.""

As the chaos ensured, ESPN's Chris Spatola also pleaded for court storming to end.
""That should not happen. That right there is why court storming should not happen,"" he said.
Last month, ESPN analyst Jay Bilas made a similar plea after Caitlin Clark was run into by a fan.

""The passion of it is great. I love the passion. Fans do not belong on the court. Ever,"" he said at the time. ""When somebody gets hurt, we’re going to get serious about it.""
The Southeastern Conference fines schools $100,000 for storming the court, but that didn't stop South Carolina fans from doing so in January after the Gamecocks beat No. 6 Kentucky. A second offense is $250,000, while subsequent offenses will cost $500,000.

"March 5, 2024 4:36pm EST","Panthers' Brian Burns, Bengals' Tee Higgins highlight franchise tags used for 2024 NFL season",Fox News,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
NFL teams had until 4 p.m. Tuesday to place a franchise tag on a player of their choosing, and several used this window to lock in key contributors for the 2024 season.
Next on the NFL offseason list will be the free agency period, which begins March 13, when some players expected to be in the franchise tag conversation can start talking to other teams to reach a new deal.
Let's take a look at some franchise-tagged players who still have a chance to negotiate a long-term deal before their price tags are locked in for 2024.

At a whopping $24 million, Burns was slapped with the franchise tag by the Panthers. And though that's a hefty salary for just one season, he and the organization are not seeing eye to eye right now.
But the tag gives the Panthers more time for Burns, who has 46 career sacks over five seasons with 246 combined tackles and two Pro Bowl nods, to possibly find common ground on a lucrative, new deal.
Burns has a non-exclusive tag with the Panthers, meaning he can talk to other teams. If a contract is sent his way, the Panthers have the opportunity to match it or take draft compensation instead.
MIKE EVANS AGREES TO STAY WITH BUCS AMID FREE AGENCY RUMORS
This move went down early. The Bengals announced late last month they were going to franchise tag Higgins for a $21.8 million cap hit.
Like Burns, the Bengals want to continue negotiating with Higgins to keep him in the fold on an offense that quarterback Joe Burrow believed would feature Ja'Marr Chase and Higgins in 2024.
Higgins had a down year in 2023 after putting up back-to-back 1,000-yard seasons in 2021 and 2022, catching 42 balls for 656 yards and five touchdowns. Injuries had a lot to do with that. He missed five games, and Burrow also went down midway through the season with a wrist injury.

The Chiefs used the non-exclusive tag on Sneed, a key member of their Super Bowl-winning formula, and his tag carries a value of over $19.8 million.
Chiefs GM Brett Veach said publicly he is going to keep Sneed and defensive tackle Chris Jones in the mix, and this franchise tag not only allows time for him to work out a possible long-term deal with his top cornerback, but also get Jones paid.
Sneed, 27, has the ability to cover any receiver anywhere, and he is not afraid to defend at the line of scrimmage. Just ask Miami Dolphins receiver Tyreek Hill about their meeting in the AFC wild-card round this year.
Sneed has 10 career interceptions, 6½ sacks and 40 passes defended in his four seasons with the Chiefs.
Teams were licking their chops waiting to see what the Ravens did with Madubuike after his breakout 2023 campaign, and GM Eric DeCosta issued a statement Tuesday relaying the news that Madubuike will be franchise tagged.
""We were unable to agree on a contract extension with Justin before the deadline and will use the franchise tag. Justin is a great player and person, and we will continue to negotiate a long-term deal with him.""
Baltimore will hope to avoid another Lamar Jackson situation in which extension talks get drawn out in public. But Madubuike, after collecting 13.0 sacks, 56 combined tackles and 33 quarterback hits, knows it's his time to cash in.

NFL Network reported Allen, the No. 7 overall pick of the 2019 NFL Draft, will get the franchise tag after playing on his fifth-year option last season and having a massive year with 17½ sacks and 33 quarterback hits.
Allen would be due $24 million if his franchise tag stood.
The report added Allen, who has 45 sacks over five seasons with the Jags, and the organization will continue negotiating on a long-term pact.
With wide receiver Mike Evans agreeing to terms on a long-term deal to stay in Tampa, the Bucs used their franchise tag on their All-Pro safety, though this appears to be a formality.

The Bucs also want to lock in Winfield long-term. If they can't, though, he'd be due $17.123 million for next season.
The 25-year-old is coming off his best season in 2023 when he had three interceptions, 12 passes defended, six sacks and eight quarterback hits. He also tallied 122 tackles, six of which were for a loss.
His versatility on defense is everything a team wants from a safety, and Tampa Bay knows he's due his big payday soon. We'll see if the Bucs make that happen before the tag kicks in.

Pittman will be a $21.816 million cap hit next season, but he's expected to continue working on a long-term deal, especially after what he's been able to do on his rookie deal.
The USC product had a career-high 1,152 yards and 109 catches along with four touchdown receptions during the 2023 season. He's clearly emerged as the No. 1 receiver Indy hoped he would be when it drafted him in the second round of the 2020 NFL Draft.
CBS reports Johnson will be getting franchise tagged as both sides try to find common ground on a new deal.
Johnson, a second-round pick by Chicago in the 2020 NFL Draft, had his best year in 2023, collecting four interceptions, 10 passes defended, one forced fumble and 36 combined tackles.
Unlike these other franchise-tagged players, the Pats placed the transition tag on Dugger. What's the difference? If Dugger negotiates a contract with another team and the Patriots don't want to match it, they won't receive draft compensation from that team.
The Patriots have the right to match any contract offer for Dugger in free agency. If he doesn't get one, he will cost $13.8 million against the cap next season.

"February 28, 2024 7:52pm EST","Knicks denied protest to loss despite NBA, refs admitting wrong call in final seconds",Fox News,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
The New York Knicks’ protest of a Feb. 12 loss to the Houston Rockets was rejected by the NBA on Wednesday despite the league admitting an incorrect foul was called that benefited Houston near the end of the game.
It was the expected outcome after the Knicks filed their protest, claiming the shooting foul against Brunson was called incorrectly, thus resulting in the loss after free throws were made by Aaron Holiday, the player Brunson apparently fouled.
""The Knicks protested the result of the game on the ground that a shooting foul was called incorrectly on the Knicks’ Jalen Brunson for making contact with the Rockets’ Aaron Holiday during a last-second shot attempt,"" the NBA’s statement with their protest ruling said. ""Under the standard for NBA game protests, New York was required to demonstrate that there was a misapplication of the official playing rules, as opposed to an error in judgment by game officials.""

Since the foul was ruled an ""error in judgment"" by the referee during the game, the loss for the Knicks was upheld.
The play came on the road for New York, where a tie game at 103 apiece saw the Rockets holding the ball with six seconds left. Holiday dribbled along the baseline with Precious Achiuwa guarding him when he kicked the ball all the way out to Holiday despite the clocking continuing to tick away.
PISTONS' MONTY WILLIAMS TEARS INTO NBA OFFICIALS AFTER LOSS: ‘ABSOLUTE WORST CALL OF THE SEASON’
Holiday heaved a desperation three-pointer to beat the clock, and Brunson provided a hand in his face to make the shot tougher. But a referee blew his whistle before the clock struck zero, and despite the ball not going in the net, Holiday was awarded free throw attempts to win the game.
The Knicks’ protest was in hopes the game would be forced to resume in overtime.

Now, referees reviewed the play in real-time to determine whether Holiday should get free throws or not, and they did in the end. However, crew chief Ed Malloy said postgame the call was wrong.
""After seeing it during postgame review, the offensive player was able to return to a normal playing position on the floor,"" Malloy told a pool reporter. ""The contact which occurred after the release of the ball therefore is incidental and marginal to the shot attempt and should not have been called.""
The NBA said the same in their protest denial explanation, but it doesn’t matter in the end.

Rashid Byrd, who played in the NBA D-League and overseas, was sentenced to 90 years to life for a series of violent sexual assaults.

""He started as a charmer, playing up his status as an athlete and pseudo-celebrity, but that quickly faded into rapes and violence,"" said Det. Dara Brown, the lead investigator on the case.

Danielle Hunter, one of the remaining high-profile free agent targets, is off the market as he agreed to terms on a two-year deal with the Houston Texans.
The former Minnesota Vikings edge rusher will be going to the Texans when the new league year begins Wednesday on a deal $49 million with $48 million guaranteed. The contract has a maximum value of $51 million.
It’s a homecoming for Hunter, who played his high school ball at Morton Ranch High School in Katy, Texas, which is about an hour from Houston. And Hunter has come a long way since those high school football days to become one of the most feared pass rushers in the league.

The 29-year-old has totaled double-digit sacks in five of his eight NFL seasons, all of which came with the Vikings to this point after they took him in the third round of the 2015 NFL Draft.
That includes the 2023 campaign, when Hunter totaled 16.5 sacks to finish fifth in the league in that category. His 23 tackles for loss, though, were tied for the league lead with Las Vegas Raiders edge-rusher Maxx Crosby. Hunter had 10.5 sacks the year before as well.

Houston also bolstered their defense at linebacker with former Atlanta Falcons starter Azeez Al-Shaair and former Baltimore Raven Del’Shawn Phillips. In the secondary, Jeff Okudah agreed to a one-year deal at cornerback and Mike Ford was also an addition.
Texans GM Nick Caserio clearly wants to build on the tremendous season Houston had last year, where rookie quarterback C.J. Stroud proved to be the franchise guy after leading them to the playoffs and defeating the Cleveland Browns in the Wild Card Round. He won Offensive Rookie of the Year for his efforts as well.
Caserio seemed to have filled all the necessary holes leading to the big splash of Hunter, including a trade for veteran running back Joe Mixon.

A lawsuit issued in Essex County, New Jersey, family court on Jan. 19 by Andrea Galea, who claims she was romantically involved with Jefferson during their days at LSU before rekindling their relationship in April 2023, says she had no choice but to file the suit after the All-Pro failed to support her child.

Stella Anastasia was born on Dec. 21, 2023, but Galea says Jefferson, 24, has not financially supported her and refused to acknowledge himself as her father.
Galea also says Jefferson ""pressured"" her to get an abortion. After Galea refused, Jefferson ""began acting towards her with great insensitivity and extreme cruelty.""
""The Defendant blocked the Plaintiff from communicating with him, and coldly told her to ‘[T]alk to me when the legal stuff come up,"" Galea’s lawsuit states, per the Daily Mail.

Jefferson filed a countersuit on Jan. 26, demanding an injunction against Galea to prevent her from sharing information about the child. Jefferson also asked for a paternity test.
In the countersuit, Jefferson claims Galea used the child’s birth as well as allegations against him to promote herself online.
""Defendant [Galea] has a substantial presence and following on various social media platforms and apparently has strategically positioned herself over the last several years to become an ‘online influencer,’"" Jefferson’s countersuit reads.
""So are you okay with getting this [situated,"" Jefferson wrote in a text message to Galea, per a screenshot the Daily Mail posted.
""U wanted the kid you can take care of it,"" he wrote in another message. ""I tried to tell u this was how it was going to go u didn’t believe me.""

Jefferson added that Galea continued ""annoying"" him about the child, resulting in him changing his phone number. There was also another text message that had Jefferson suggesting Galea take a Plan B.
""The more u wait the hard the situation will be that’s why I wanted to get you the planB [because] I didn’t want to be in this situation but it’s totally my fault I shouldn’t have done it in the first place,"" Jefferson texted Galea.
""Justin I took the plan b though it was just too late for it to be effective. Sometimes depending on the cycle unless you take it within like 2 hours it can be too late,"" she responded. ""… and two people are always at fault in this. Personally I’ve never faced a situation like this…’""
Jefferson is set to play the final year of his rookie contract after the Vikings picked up his fifth-year option that’s worth $19.743 for the 2024 season.

This year’s running backs class was star-studded, though many were wondering what exactly the market would be after the 2023 offseason saw a lack of paying running backs.
Well, the position was completely shaken up for next season with big names flying off the free agent board, and that is no pun intended for the biggest deal of them all: Saquon Barkley joining the Philadelphia Eagles.
The former New York Giants star is heading to his NFC East rival on a three-year pact that would net a maximum $46.76 million. If the rivalry was not strong already, this created an immediate divide on social media between Eagles and Giants fans. Even Giants legend Tiki Barber tried to say Barkley’s legacy in New York is tarnished, to which the Penn State product barked back on social media by calling him a ""hater.""
Either way, Barkley’s arrival in Philly next season, alongside Jalen Hurts, A.J. Brown, DeVonta Smith, and Dallas Goedert, makes this Eagles squad very scary.
JOSH JACOBS, PACKERS AGREE TO DEAL AFTER STANDOUT TENURE WITH RAIDERS: REPORT
Eagles fans probably forgot by now that D’Andre Swift signed a three-year deal of his own to join the Chicago Bears. He will be getting $24 million in the deal, according to reports.
However, Josh Jacobs and the Green Bay Packers surprised everyone with their pact – a four-year, $48 million deal, according to NFL Network, that will net him $12 million per season. In turn, the Packers will be releasing Aaron Jones, their veteran back who will now enter the free agency pool.
Another release was the Cincinnati Bengals and Joe Mixon, as they instead signed former Indianapolis Colts running back Zack Moss to a two-year, $8 million deal.
Here are other notable running backs who came off the board:

You like that, Atlanta Falcons fans?
With Russell Wilson announcing he was going to the Pittsburgh Steelers late Sunday night, all eyes were on Kirk Cousins, the top free agent quarterback, to see what he would do with his talents in Year 13 of his career. Would he stay in Minnesota to continue playing for the Vikings, or head elsewhere?
Cousins chose a new chapter in his football life, going to the Falcons, who were the frontrunner to land him if he chose a team other than the Vikings. He agreed to a reported four-year deal worth $180 million with $100 million guaranteed at signing.
Those are big bucks for the 35-year-old, who is coming off a torn Achilles that ended his final season with the Vikings in Week 8 last year. However, Cousins’ production of over 4,000-plus yards in his three previous seasons is something the Falcons are betting he can do with their dynamic, young talent, which includes Drake London, Kyle Pitts and Bijan Robinson.
There were a couple of other quarterback transactions on Monday as well.
Gardner Minshew creates true competition in training camp with Aidan O’Connell, as he joins the Las Vegas Raiders on a two-year, $25 million deal. Additionally, happy reunion to Jacoby Brissett, the journeyman quarterback who is back with the New England Patriots on a one-year, $8 million deal. Brissett is expected to compete with Bailey Zappe and perhaps the No. 3 overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft if the pick is a quarterback as many predict.

Both offensive line and defensive line free agents were checked off the board, including the Raiders making a huge splash by signing former Miami Dolphins defensive tackle Christian Wilkins to a $110 million deal over four years. He will be fun to watch alongside Maxx Crosby out in Sin City.
There was also Jonathan Greenard not returning to the Houston Texans, but rather choosing a $76 million deal over four years with the Vikings, including $42 million guaranteed at signing. Another defensive tackle, Leonard Williams, found common ground with the Seattle Seahawks, who traded for him from the Giants last season. He signed a three-year deal worth $64.5 million.
In the outside linebacker department, the Eagles signed Bryce Huff, the New York Jets’ undrafted project that turned into a stud off the edge, to a three-year, $51 million deal. Frankie Luvu also cashed in with the Commanders on a $36 million deal over three years.
Here are other defensive linemen with a new home in the NFL:
The men tasked with blocking these linemen also had some big paydays, like former Dolphins guard Robert Hunt, who agreed to a five-year, $100 million deal to join the Carolina Panthers. He gets $63 million at signing.
CHRISTIAN WILKINS, RAIDERS AGREE TO MASSIVE 4-YEAR DEAL: REPORTS
The Patriots also found the right price with Mike Onwenu, their standout guard, on a three-year, $57 million deal with $38 million guaranteed.
The Giants, in desperate need of offensive line help, added two veteran interior players in Jon Runyan (3 years, $30 million) and Jermaine Eluemunor (2 years, $14 million).
Here’s who else found new offensive lines to play for in 2024:

The safety market is one that experts had a bad feeling about this offseason given the number of releases teams had there. However, former Giant Xavier McKinney may have set the market on day one with his four-year, $68 million deal to join the Green Bay Packers – a team that needed safety help.
One of the safeties McKinney is replacing is Darnell Savage, who moved on to the Jacksonville Jaguars on a $21.75 million deal over the next three years. The Bears also landed All-Pro Kevin Byard (2 years, $15 million) and Geno Stone is going to the Cincinnati Bengals (2 years, $14 million).
There is still lots of safety talent available, but to see a good amount go on day one should give solace to those still waiting for a new deal.
As for cornerbacks, Chidobe Awuzie’s deal with the Titans (3 years, $36 million) was the cream of the crop. There was also Sean Bunting landing with the Cardinals for $25.5 million over three years.
Here are other secondary pieces who will ink new deals come Wednesday:

The Giants reached a trade with the Panthers for two-time Pro Bowl edge rusher Brian Burns, and they immediately extended him with a five-year deal worth up to $150 million.
Burns is now the second-highest-paid defensive end in NFL history.
New York only sent away a 2024 second-round pick and 2025 fifth-round pick for the 25-year-old star, which was surprising considering what the Los Angeles Rams previously offered for Burns in 2023: a 2023 second-rounder, 2024 first-rounder and 2025 first-rounder.
The Panthers declined then, but after both sides could not find common ground on a new deal, which led to a franchise tag earlier this month, Burns is on the move and got his big payday he was looking for.
While Carolina fans may be scratching their heads, the Giants are ecstatic to get Burns signed long-term to go with defensive tackle Dexter Lawrence and end Kayvon Thibodeaux.
A large chunk of the free agent market found new homes next season, but there are still a bunch of players looking for a deal after day one, beginning with Derrick Henry in the running backs market.
With Jacobs and Barkley setting the tone with deals at $12 million and $12.583 million respectively, Henry’s market could be set around that price tag now. Jones and Mixon join him now as the top backs looking for a new team after their release. There is still Ezekiel Elliott, Alexander Mattison, JK Dobbins and others as well.
Additionally, while Gabe Davis found a new home with the Jaguars (3 years, $39 million), receiver was not the theme on Monday. Perhaps the likes of Calvin Ridley, Odell Beckham Jr., Hollywood Brown, K.J. Osborn and many others could be heading somewhere on Tuesday.
As far as defense goes, Danielle Hunter is a name to watch, as the 29-year-old former Vikings edge rusher is more than capable of disrupting offenses in 2024. Linebacker Patrick Queen remains available, too, as does safety Justin Simmons and edge rusher Chase Young.

Joey Logano was set to start the Ambetter Health 400 at Atlanta Motor Speedway on the front row alongside Michael McDowell, but he was moved to the back of the pack due to an odd rules violation.

Larry McReynolds, a FOX NASCAR analyst, said on ""FOX RaceDay"" that Logano was penalized for a safety violation. He said each piece of gear a driver has needs to be ""SFI rated"" – which is a safety rating.

After a three-year run with the Raiders, tight end Darren Waller was traded to the New York Giants in March 2023.
Waller learned he would be playing the 2023 season with a new team shortly after he married Las Vegas Aces star Kelsey Plum.
The two-time WNBA champion appeared to take issue with the trade and jokingly suggested her husband was traded because Josh McDaniels, the Raiders head coach at the time, did not have the opportunity to attend the couple's wedding.
Waller ultimately relocated across the country, and his first season with the Giants was widely viewed as a disappointment.

Waller finished the season with just one touchdown. The lack of production appeared to lead to conversations between Waller and Giants officials about the tight end possibly calling it quits, according to a New York Post report.
Waller missed several games due to injuries during his time with the Raiders. He was also sidelined for five games during his first year in New Jersey.

The Cowboys selected Dorsey in the seventh round of the 2001 draft. He played in nine games in his rookie season but did not last with the team through 2002. He split time with the Cowboys and the expansion Houston Texans that season.
He signed with the New York Giants in the 2003 offseason but knee surgery forced him onto the physically unable to perform list. The Giants waived him before the start of the football season.

The rival Saudi-backed golf league first filed with the Official World Golf Ranking board in July 2022, but the bid was rejected this past October.

""It is unfortunate that no way to include LIV Golf in the Ranking could be found which would be fair and equitable to the 24 currently eligible tours and their thousands of playing members,"" OWGR Chairman Peter Dawson said at the time.

""Keeping this matter under review, OWGR will continue to monitor developments in men’s professional golf as a whole and at LIV in particular.""
But in a letter to players this week, Norman hit back at the OWGR.
""It is now clear that the best way forward for LIV as a league and you as LIV golfers is not through the current ranking system,"" Norman wrote, via ESPN.

""A resolution which protects the accuracy, credibility, and integrity of the OWGR rankings no longer exists. We have made enormous efforts to fight for you and to ensure your accomplishments are recognized within the existing ranking system. Unfortunately, the OWGR has shown little willingness to productively work with us.""
The application, according to OWGR, was rejected in part due to concerns over format and player pathways.

""We are not at war with them,"" he said. ""This decision not to make them eligible is not political. It is entirely technical. LIV players are self-evidently good enough to be ranked. They’re just not playing in a format where they can be ranked equitably with the other 24 tours and thousands of players trying to compete on them.""

"March 2, 2024 9:36am EST",Warriors' Klay Thompson uses boat to rescue longtime teammate Draymond Green from bridge during protests,Fox News,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Klay Thompson and Draymond Green have been teammates for a decade. They have nine NBA All-Star selections between them, and both have been crucial pieces of the Golden State Warriors' championship core.
Last November, Green made his unexpected debut on Thompson's boat. During a recent appearance on the ""7PM in Brooklyn with Carmelo Anthony and The Kid Mero"" podcast, Green detailed his first visit to it. Green noted that the vessel was a key part of a rescue mission.
Green was trapped on the San Francisco–Oakland Bay in mid-November when demonstrators forced the closure of the Bay Bridge, which frequently carries some of the heaviest amounts of vehicle traffic in the region.

At the time, Green had recently returned to the Oakland area following his five-game suspension for his role in a physical altercation with Minnesota Timberwolves center Rudy Gobert.

After a few ideas to make it across the bridge proved unsuccessful, Thompson arrived on the scene with his boat, Green said.
""Klay came on his boat across the water to pick me up in Jack London Square in Oakland,"" Green explained as the hosts began to laugh. ""[VP of team operations] Eric Housen tried to get the cops to like escort me through. Nothing could work, you could not get across.""

Green added that the whole ordeal whadbeen captured on video. Notably, Thompson was believed to have owned the boat for around four years prior to Green climbing aboard for the first time on that fateful day.

Although Green and Thompson have developed and maintained an impressive chemistry on the court, the boat story seems to speak to the apparent limited amount of time they spend together outside of basketball.

The 31-year-old appeared to collapse while standing in front of the Thunder bench in the second quarter. The game was delayed while Biyombo was attended to. A wheelchair was brought onto the court, but the veteran never used it. He was helped off and headed for the locker room.

Biyombo was the No. 7 overall pick of the 2011 NBA Draft. He was traded to the Charlotte Bobcats, where he became a top rebounder, but not so much a scorer.
He eventually made his way to the Toronto Raptors, where he put together a 26-rebound performance in the playoffs against the Cleveland Cavaliers.

"March 11, 2024 2:32pm EDT","Kirk Cousins, Falcons agree to 4-year deal",Fox News,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Kirk Cousins' next chapter in the NFL will be with the Atlanta Falcons, as he's agreed to become their new starting quarterback, his agent Mike McCartney announced.
Cousins agreed to a four-year deal with the Falcons worth a reported $180 million, with $100 million guaranteed.
Cousins was the top free agent quarterback on the market when the season ended, and there was some hope that he and the Minnesota Vikings could find common ground on a new deal.

But talks with the Falcons clearly intensified and the 35-year-old heads to a new situation in a wide open NFC South division, where he'll be loaded with dynamic, young talent on offense.
Cousins' final season in Minnesota did not go as planned, though. He suffered a torn Achilles in Week 8 against the Green Bay Packers, ending his year prematurely. How he returns from such an injury will be interesting to see, but the Falcons clearly believe in what he has to offer with their multi-year commitment.
FALCONS' SOCIAL MEDIA TEAM OFFERS REMINDER TO EXCITED FANS AMID KIRK COUSINS BUZZ
The Falcons have been searching for the right answer at quarterback for quite some time, especially after their first-round investments in the likes of tight end Kyle Pitts, wide receiver Drake London, and most recently, running back Bijan Robinson. Falcons fans grew tired of Desmond Ridder and Taylor Heinecke last season, with many suggesting more consistent quarterback play would've led to a division win.
It's why the Falcons were among the frontrunners to bring in a new quarterback this season to work under new head coach Raheem Morris and new offensive coordinator Zac Robinson. Cousins will look to get on the same page with his weapons quickly this offseason, and Falcons fans should be excited considering what Cousins has done for the Vikings over the past six seasons.

Cousins was on pace to throw for another 4,000-plus yards in 2023 after doing so in three straight seasons from 2020-22. He had 2,331 yards in eight weeks last season with 18 touchdowns to five interceptions and a 69.5% completion rate. He went 4-4 in his starts.
The Vikings were 13-4 during the regular season in 2022, where Cousins shined with 4,547 yards and 29 touchdowns over his 17 games. Minnesota unceremoniously fell to the New York Giants in the wild-card round, though, quickly exiting the NFL playoffs.
With Cousins on the move, the Vikings’ quarterback of the future is up in the air. Nick Mullens and Jaren Hall are the only quarterbacks on the roster, which suggests Minnesota will need to pivot elsewhere to find a quality starter in 2024.

Owen Lloyd's ACC championship celebration was extremely short-lived, as he was stripped of his title for an obscure technicality.
The N.C. State swimmer won the men's 1650-yard freestyle ACC title on Saturday night, but almost immediately after touching the wall first, he was no longer the champion.
That's because after the race, during his celebration, he propelled himself on top of the lane divider in which his own teammate, Ross Dent, was next to him. Lloyd sat on top of the divider and let out a victorious scream, all while a proud Dent, who finished second, pointed at him in celebration.

The NCAA, however, ruled that by mounting the divider, despite Dant being finished with his race, Lloyd ""interfered with another swimmer,"" stripping him of his title and giving it to Dant.
The incident occurs at roughly the 14:55 mark of the video below.
Lloyd was emotional after the race, all while the crowd booed the new results.
In his post-race interview, Dant noted that swimmers must stay in their own lane until the race is complete – but he said it's the ""dumbest rule in swimming"" in a strong defense of his teammate.
The NCAA rulebook says, ""A swimmer who changes lanes during a heat shall be disqualified…"" (Scott Taetsch/NCAA Photos via Getty Images)
""Owen beat me fair and square. He should be on that podium. He was excited. That was a huge win for him. He earned that, and that's his emotion,"" Dant said. ""That's what we get in the sport of swimming when we do well. We train all year for a moment like that, and to have him disqualified is the dumbest thing ever. He works so hard every day.
""He is gonna be on the No. 1 trophy. I am not going to stand up there.""

""A swimmer who changes lanes during a heat shall be disqualified…
""A team representative or spectator who enters the water in the area in which a race is being conducted before all contestants have completed the race may disqualify all of their team’s entrants in that race.""

Federal prosecutors detailed some of former Jacksonville Jaguars employee Amit Patel's extravagant expenditures.
Patel is accused of embezzling an estimated $22 million from the NFL franchise.
Federal investigators allege a significant amount of the money financed a ""life of luxury."" According to a recent court filing, Patel purchased Tiger Woods' putter from 1996 and spent more than $78,000 on private air travel.
A $275,000 retainer for Patel's attorney, Alex King, was paid with the misappropriated funds, according to the court filing. King asserted his client developed a gambling addiction and, as losses began to mount, he used the fraudulently obtained money to pay off his debt.

King estimated ""99% of the misappropriated funds"" were used to subsidize the gambling losses. However, authorities said Patel used approximately $5 million on personal expenses.
Documents showed Patel transferred approximately $20 million to FanDuel and another $1 million to DraftKings. Patel is believed to have spent close to $600,000 on various items from Apple and more than $40,000 at Amazon and Best Buy combined.

Donaldson’s decline over the past two seasons was apparent, hitting .222/.308/.374 with the New York Yankees in 2022 — his first season with the team after being traded from the Minnesota Twins. Then, he hit .152/.249/.418 in 50 games between the Yankees and Milwaukee Brewers.
But Donaldson’s impact on the game came first with the Oakland Athletics in 2013 when he hit .301/.384/.499 with 24 homers, 37 doubles and 93 RBI in a breakout season that showed the 27-year-old as one of the best third basemen in MLB.

He would earn his first All-Star appearance in the American League in 2014, but his best season was easily his first with the Toronto Blue Jays in 2015, winning American League MVP after driving in 123 runs with a .297/.371/.568, 41 homers and 122 runs.
Donaldson finished top 10 in MVP voting four times in his career, which also included time with the Cleveland Guardians and Atlanta Braves.
While the ""Bringer of Rain"" was mostly known for his big leg kick that led to 279 homers and 816 RBI over his 13-year career, he was one of the smoothest third basemen in the league throughout his career.

Four-time Pro Bowl quarterback Kirk Cousins is set to officially enter the free agent market next month.
The 35-year-old has spent the past six seasons with the Minnesota Vikings, leading the team to the playoffs two times. Cousins was in the midst of arguably the best season of his career until he suffered a season-ending Achilles injury during an October game against the Green Bay Packers.
There has been a considerable amount of speculation surrounding the soon-to-be free agent's potential 2024 landing spot, but Vikings head coach Kevin O'Connell expressed some confidence that Cousins could remain in Minnesota for the foreseeable future.
""Kirk Cousins knows how I feel about him. I've held no secrets there. He knows how the Minnesota Vikings feel about him. I believe Kirk wants to be a Viking, and we're going to work to try to make that the outcome,"" O'Connell said during Tuesday's media session at the NFL Scouting Combine.

I feel like we're heading toward a good place with Kirk, but like we've seen, free agency and the uncertainties for this time of year, you've got to be ready in a leadership role to have contingency plans and adjust on the fly.""

Cousins recently posted a social media video of him throwing footballs on his surgically repaired leg on a tennis course. O'Connell was pleased with the progression of Cousins' rehab.
""But it's been awesome to see him through his rehab and where he is now, really getting right back on his feet and attacking this thing. My feelings on Kirk Cousins have not wavered, and if anything, they're stronger now, having gone through a lot of adversity together.""

And what we did ... we met as a program that day and I just told them, ‘Listen guys, take the rest of this day, take time to process this however you need to process it.’ But what we did talk about … we talked about the uncertainty that now surrounded everybody because everybody's mind immediately went to what's next.
""We just asked, 'Hey, let's commit all of us here to keeping the future in the future.' And then there was a reality to the opportunity that was in front of us. We knew our schedule was tough down the stretch. And we knew that also provided great opportunity.""

The 37-year-old coach also credited the coaching staff and the players for the team's late-season success.
""The great thing through all of this is … you've seen the character of the guys in this program, the guys on our team, our staff. You've seen the character of everyone just be revealed [at] such a high level, that's why I think we've been able to have some success here down the stretch.""
The Buckeyes got off to a 5-1 start when Diebler took over last month. Ohio State enters the Big Ten tournament with a 19-12 record.

Holtmann led Ohio State to an impressive 12-2 start, but the team struggled as the season progressed. The Buckeyes were 14-11 at the time of Holtmann's dismissal.
If Ohio State can make a serious run in the tournament, it would bolster its odds of being selected for the big dance. During a recent press conference, Diebler took a few moments to lobby for his team's inclusion in the tournament's field of 68, citing Ohio State's improved play over the past several weeks.

""Absolutely, absolutely,"" Diebler said in response to a question about whether he believes the Buckeyes are worthy of a March Madness berth.
""I’m no expert on all the metrics that go into making that decision. But I would think a couple of our top wins would stack up against anybody in the country. We’ve now stacked together some road wins. Also, the momentum that we have and the way we’ve been playing lately?"" said Diebler. ""I think there’s a lot of positives that, you know, would help our case.""

United States women’s national team legend Carli Lloyd brought more hard truth about the state of her old squad to social media on Monday night.
Lloyd watched as the USWNT lost their Concacaf Golf Cup group stage match to Mexico, 2-0, on Monday and took to X to voice her opinion: No one fears the team like they used to.
""Yes the whole world has caught up… but I actually hate when people say that because the #USWNT started to regress at 2020 Olympics and have gone backwards,"" Lloyd wrote in her post. "".. now they have to rebuild and claw and climb their way back up #NoOneFearsTheUswntanymore""

Lloyd had much support in the comments of her post, including one she responded to that said, ""American supremacy is a myth! We’re the same as everyone else.""
""Yes!"" Lloyd said. ""Teams used to lose to game before they played us because of fear and intimidation… as the complacency and lack of hunger crept in during 2020 it has given teams the confidence to know the US is beatable so that edge is lost.""
Lloyd, who retired from professional soccer in November 2021 following an illustrious career that had two Olympic gold medals and two World Cup titles, has been saying this since last year’s World Cup disappointment. The USWNT lost in the Round of 16 to Sweden via penalty shootout.
CARLI LLOYD ON WHY SHE ‘HAD ENOUGH’ WITH USWNT KNEELING AT OLYMPICS: ‘FELT LIKE IT WAS JUST A THING TO DO’
It was the earliest exit in a World Cup in USWNT history.
Analysts like Lloyd and Alexi Lalas, who were both in Australia and New Zealand for the tournament, didn’t hold back when they saw a lack of disappointment on the faces of the players themselves.
Lloyd also spoke with her former teammate Hope Solo on the ""Hope Solo Speaks"" podcast, where she admitted not liking a culture change to the team in her final years playing.

""Even within our squad, the culture has changed,"" she said in 2022. ""It was really tough and challenging to play these last several years. To be quite honest, I hated it. It wasn’t fun going in. It was only for love of the game, really, for me. I wanted to win and wanted to help the team, but the culture within the team was the worst I had ever seen it. So, I’m hoping that the future is bright and some things change.""
The USWNT still has solid, young talent including Trinity Rodman, Sophia Smith and Lindsey Horan to name a few. Emma Hayes was also announced as the next USWNT head coach following Vlatko Andonovski’s resignation after the 2023 World Cup.
Currently, Twila Kilgore is serving as interim head coach until Hayes is finished with the 2023-24 Women’s Super League season in England. She will join the team prior to the 2024 Paris Olympics.
The USWNT will aim to bounce back in the SheBelieves Cup semifinal on April 6 against Japan, but the true test for this squad will be seen in Paris this summer, where Lloyd and many others hope there is recognition that the U.S. is no longer feared.

At the moment, he's best known as Ashtray from the HBO series, ""Euphoria"", but his main goal is to be known by another name.
Javon ""Wanna"" Walton has established himself as one of the hottest young actors in the world.
At age 17, he's parlayed his main roles from ""Euphoria"" and ""Utopia"" to nearly 6 million Instagram followers. But becoming an actor was never his main goal.
His true passion is boxing, and next Saturday he'll be living out his dream by making his professional debut in Puerto Rico.

Walton recently signed with Most Valuable Promotions, the brand founded by Jake Paul in 2021, and he'll be fighting on the undercard that features Paul and his ""big sis,"" Amanda Serrano, in the main event.
Walton says he was ""punching pillows"" when he was 2 years old and watching boxing on TV at age 4. So, after establishing himself as an actor, it's time to take ""a little pause"" in Hollywood and chase his passion.
""I think that’s what makes me special, though, is being able to do both,"" Walton told Fox News Digital in a recent interview. ""Not many people can say they’re good at two things in their lifetime. Both of those careers, I absolutely love, but boxing is definitely the priority right now.""
Walton was homeschooled for most of his childhood for boxing, not acting. He had 80 amateur fights, he says, and traveled constantly. By the time he was 13, he was on hundreds of thousands of television sets as Ashtray.

""I feel like [I've been] a grown man since I was 4 years old,"" Walton joked. ""It’s definitely tough to have two different careers, but if you love something, it doesn’t feel like work.
""I love both, but I really just want to hone in on boxing,"" he added. ""There’s a lot I need to accomplish in boxing. In the acting world, I’ve definitely established myself a little bit, but now it’s time to do that in the boxing world and show people what I’ve been working on for the past 13 years of my life.""
Walton says the MVP brand is ""like family.""
""Jake is a super cool guy. I’ve gotten to know him pretty good. We text often. And big sis Amanda Serrano, I got a lot of the boxing world from her. She’s really the GOAT of women’s boxing, so big ups to her. … The whole team over there is just awesome. We got a good roster of such great fighters, and I think that’s what really drew me to MVP, is that there’s some real talent over there.

The 2023 season marked the first time in more than two decades Tom Brady was not on an NFL roster. Brady, who turned 46 in August, appears to have remained physically active since his football career came to an end.
Hundreds of prospects are in Indianapolis for this year's NFL Combine. Nearly 25 years ago, Brady was preparing to enter the NFL Draft.
On Thursday, Brady shared a video on social media showing him running the 40-yard dash. He finished with a time of 5.28 seconds at the 2000 league combine.
The retired quarterback decided to give the 40-yard sprint another shot, and he beat his time from his early 20s.

The 2000 sixth-round draft pick out of Michigan accepted the 40-yard dash challenge and shared a workout video for athletics apparel company NoBull. Brady merged his TB12 wellness company and his apparel venture Brady Brand with NoBull earlier this year.
""Twenty-four years ago, I ran a 5.28 40-yard dash,"" Brady said in a video which he posted to X, formerly Twitter. ""Maybe, just maybe, we give the 40 one more shot.""
TOM BRADY 'SURPRISED' BILL BELICHICK DID NOT GET COACHING JOB: 'THE GREATEST COACH EVER'
Two people clocked Brady's run, with one clocking him at 5.18 seconds. The other clock showed Brady finished his run in 5.12 seconds. ""24 years later, redemption is spelled T O M,"" Brady wrote on X.
Brady was the 199th overall selection in the 2000 draft. He became the Patriots' starting quarterback early in the 2001 season, after Drew Bledsoe was injured. Brady never looked back and led the Patriots to the Super Bowl that season. He won five more Super Bowls in New England.
Brady won the seventh Super Bowl of his storied career during his first season with the Tampa Bay Buccanears.
Brady is also an avid golfer.

Earlier this month, videos went viral across social media of Brady's less-than-stellar tee shot on the 14th hole during the second round of Pebble Beach Pro-Am. The three-time NFL MVP later offered a relatively simple explanation for the errant tee shot.
""Driver was off the rack. Turns out they don’t do breakfast balls at Pebble,"" he wrote on X.

Dak Prescott’s brother appeared to be among the Dallas Cowboys fans upset with the lack of moves the team made during free agency and expressed that as much on Monday.

""So, if it wasn’t clear already, it is now. The @Eagles have the best front office in the NFL,"" Prescott wrote on X.
He was far from the only one upset with how the Cowboys did on the first day of free agency. Former Dallas stars Dez Bryant and Marcus Spears were among others to express their frustration.
On Tuesday, the Cowboys re-signed long snapper Trent Sieg. While an important player on the Cowboys’ special teams, it was not exactly going to get Cowboys fans jazzed up.
Part of the frustration appeared to stem from Cowboys owner Jerry Jones saying the team was ""all-in"" this offseason at the Senior Bowl. He later couched it at the NFL Scouting Combine.

""But I think the attention that the nuances of where we are with the cap, the nuances of where we are with our position in the draft, the nuances of where we are with our free agents that we get that involved in (is) the definition of 'We're all-in.’""

New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft is a fan of Taylor Swift, but he believes a different NFL tight end should be by her side.
Kraft was seen speaking to a group in a video on social media this Saturday, where he discussed Swift’s star status as well as her relationship with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce.
""Think about it: She was 18, 19 [years old] and she’s done pretty well. Except maybe she should’ve been dating Gronk [former Patriots star Rob Gronkowski]. He’s better looking.""

Kraft smiled while making his joke, but he prefaced that small quip with a story about Swift’s attendance at the Chiefs-Patriots matchup this past regular season – one where he gave her a gift.
""Taylor, her first stadium concert was on my birthday in 2010, June 5,"" Kraft told a group at the Topps Hobby Rip Night in West Palm Beach, Fla on Saturday night. ""We convinced her and her family that she could sell out a stadium.
TAYLOR SWIFT SINGS TO TRAVIS KELCE, KISSES HIM AT SYDNEY STOP OF HER ‘ERAS TOUR’
""So, when she came to view the Chiefs play the Patriots this year at Gillette, I gave her a framed ticket from that concert, June 5, 2010.""
While Kraft may want Swift to date Gronkowski, the 34-year-old has been with his longtime girlfriend, Camille Kostek, a former Patriots dancer and current model, since he was in New England winning championships alongside Tom Brady.

Meanwhile, the romance between Swift and Kelce captivated the NFL this season, including the Dec. 17, 2023, win by the Chiefs over the Patriots on the road at Gillette Stadium.
The Chiefs ended up going to the Super Bowl again this season, taking down the San Francisco 49ers in overtime to retain their title as NFL champions.
Gronkowski, who initially retired in 2019 before returning to the gridiron with Brady in Tampa Bay, did get the best of Kelce and the Chiefs before retiring again. It came in Super Bowl LV, where the Buccaneers trounced the Chiefs, 31-9, with Gronkowski scoring two touchdowns in the game.
While Gronkowski continues to enjoy life post-retirement with Kostek, Kelce took the long flight to Sydney, Australia, to watch Swift’s Eras Tour, which was another international stop for him. He previously went to Buenos Aires, Argentina, during the Chiefs’ bye week to support Swift as well.
The Topps Hobby Rip Night was a nationwide event Fanatics Collectibles put together on National Trading Card Day, where kids got to interact with more than just Kraft at various locations.

Russell Wilson is quite possibly the hottest name on the free agent market right now, and he technically hasn’t become one yet, with the Denver Broncos needing to release him at the start of the new league year on March 13.
But with the team already announcing their intentions to do so, they’ve given Wilson the permission to meet with teams before the free agency tampering period begins next week.
One Broncos rival in the AFC West is reportedly among those that want a meeting with him.

The Las Vegas Raiders could ""possibly"" bring in Wilson for a meeting, according to ESPN’s Adam Schefter.
This comes after the Pittsburgh Steelers and New York Giants either had, or have set up, a meeting with Wilson. The Super Bowl-winning quarterback was spotted in Newark International Airport earlier this week before flying to his meeting with the Steelers.
The Raiders make sense as a team that would be interested in Wilson’s services, one of which being Jimmy Garoppolo’s expected release when the new league year begins.
RUSSELL WILSON MEETS WITH SURPRISE TEAM AHEAD OF VISIT WITH STEELERS: REPORT
Garoppolo signed a three-year deal with the team last offseason following Derek Carr’s release. But midway through the year, interim head coach Antonio Pierce, who had that tag axed when owner Mark Davis named him full-time head coach this offseason, went with rookie quarterback Aidan O’Connell instead.
Garoppolo is also suspended two games to start this year after violating the league’s performance-enhancing drugs policy.
While Pierce showed confidence in O’Connell, perhaps the Raiders are looking for a veteran to start instead this season while O’Connell continues developing.
Thanks to the veteran minimum deal Wilson is expected to receive – the Broncos still have to pay him $39 million this season – the Raiders could sign him without hurting their finances.

But that’s the case for a lot of teams this offseason who will talk to Wilson. He wants a starting role, and it may come down to who offers more money, or more importantly in his eyes since he’s mentioned wanting more Super Bowl rings, who can contend in 2024.
The Raiders proved they have an up-and-coming team, though it still needs a more well-rounded roster. On the offensive side of the ball, they could be losing Josh Jacobs to free agency, and he’s been their driving force in the backfield for quite some time.
However, Davante Adams is locked in as the team’s top receiver with new GM Tom Telesco squashing any rumors that he would be traded. Telesco also mentioned wanting to try to sign Jacobs long-term, so there’s at least hope that he could remain in a Raiders uniform.
As the new league year begins, Wilson’s intentions will soon be figured out. But it’s possible that the Raiders will have more than just the Steelers and Giants to worry about if they’re serious about onboarding Wilson next year.
Wilson’s Broncos tenure was a disaster, as he was benched at the end of the regular season last year amid controversy over his injury guarantee. The benching came after a crucial win over the Kansas City Chiefs that kept the Broncos in the playoff hunt.

The Raiders hold the 13th pick in the upcoming NFL Draft.
Caleb Williams, Drake Maye and Jayden Daniels are this year's top quarterback prospects. If the Raiders don't want to trade for or sign a veteran free agent quarterback, the team could elect to trade up to secure one of the top young signal-callers.
RAIDERS' ANTONIO PIERCE EXPLAINS 'JORDAN RULES' HE'LL USE AGAINST PATRICK MAHOMES NEXT SEASON
""I am sure that's something that Telesco has already spoken about, but that's my personality,"" Pierce said of the possibility of pulling off a trade to move up in the draft. ""As you guys saw and witnessed, I am a go-getter. But, obviously, that has to be a collective agreement.""
Last season, Aidan O'Connell, a 2023 fourth-round draft pick, handled the starting quarterback duties for 10 games. The Raiders signed veteran quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo last offseason, but he struggled mightily, throwing seven touchdowns and nine interceptions in his seven games.

The franchise is expected to release Garoppolo later this offseason. Pierce laid out what he is looking for in the team's next quarterback, saying he was not interested in a ""Band-Aid.""
""I would hope whoever we draft, that's the route we go, that's who the starter becomes,"" Pierce said. ""You don't want to put a Band-Aid at that position. That's old … that's old, man. I think the Raiders … we've seen that enough in this organization.""

We've got the world champs in our division again. You know what you have to deal with each and every year as long as you have Patrick Mahomes in our division,"" Pierce said.
""I want somebody that says, 'You know what? I am up for that challenge.' That's the same way I look at it going against these three coaches in this division.""

Pierce added that he is seeking a signal-caller who has a proven ability to win.

""We are thrilled for Justin and his family and equally happy for our fan base. This is a great way to start the new league year!""
Baltimore originally placed the franchise tag on the interior lineman. Since Madubuike was a third-round pick, he was not eligible for a fifth-year option.
With no other worthy candidates, the Ravens played it safe and tagged him, ensuring he'd be on the team in 2024, but it was apparent something long-term was on the table.
DeCosta said at the time the team would keep trying to negotiate a long-term deal with Madubuike, and that worked out quickly. Baltimore previously used the franchise tag on star quarterback Lamar Jackson, then reached a long-term contract with him after he requested a trade.

The average annual value of Madubuike's deal is actually higher than the franchise tag price of $22 million. He will average $24.5 million over the course of the contract, the second-highest average ever behind only Aaron Donald's $31.6 million.
The deal comes after Madubuike's first Pro Bowl nod. He was a second-team All-Pro and finished in ninth place in the Defensive Player of the Year voting. Madubuike recorded a career-high 13 sacks, more than doubling his previous career high of 5½ in 2022.
Madubuike tied an NFL record when he had at least a half sack in 11 consecutive games.
The Ravens still have some decisions to make. Linebacker Patrick Queen, edge rushers Jadeveon Clowney and Kyle Van Noy and running backs J.K. Dobbins and Gus Edwards are all scheduled to be free agents.

But with Madubuike locked up, and All-Pro safety Kyle Hamilton under team control for another five years, the Ravens can build around their two young studs on defense.

Caitlin Clark notched another milestone on her way to the top of the scoring charts Wednesday.
The Iowa sharpshooter scored 33 points in the Hawkeyes’ 108-60 win over Minnesota. Clark surpassed former Kansas standout Lynette Woodard for the major college scoring record with 3,650 points.
Iowa coach Lisa Bluder celebrated Clark’s milestone, but took a shot at the NCAA for not recognizing Woodard’s mark as the top scorer in women’s college basketball. Woodard played for the Kansas Jayhawks in the AIAW era — before the NCAA began sanctioning women’s basketball.

""Tonight is the night of the real record,"" Bluder said. ""For some reason the NCAA does not want to recognize the basketball that was played prior to 1982, and that’s wrong. We played basketball back then. They just don’t want to recognize it, and that hurts the rest of us who were playing at that time. There’s no reason why that should not be the true record.""
Clark and the school celebrated when Clark surpassed Kelsey Plum for the all-time Division 1 record on Feb. 15. Plum totaled 3,527 points all time at Washington. Woodard scored 3,649 points from 1977-81.
""Maybe the NCAA will realize that now. Maybe it will be brought to their attention, and they will start recognizing those women who played in the ’70s,"" Bluder said. ""Remember, they played with a larger basketball and no 3-point line, either.""

Clark recognized Woodard as well.
""I’m just really thankful and grateful to have those players who have come before me. Yeah, it’s super special. Obviously, she’s one of the best all-time,"" she said. ""It just still shows the room that we have to improve, and where women’s sports is going is a really great place.""
Clark sits just 17 points behind the late Pete Maravich for the all-time scoring record in NCAAA men’s and women’s basketball. Maravich scored 3,667 points during his time at LSU.
Pearl Moore, of Francis Marion, has the overall women’s collegiate record with 4,061 points at the small-college level in AIAW. She had 177 points in junior college before enrolling at Francis Marion.

"March 6, 2024 6:53am EST",Travis Kelce says his yearlong marijuana suspension was 'red flag' for Cowboys in resurfaced clip,Fox News,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
The NFL Scouting Combine is where draft prospects make or break their grade.
Of course, it is not the end-all-be-all of how one's career will go, and Travis Kelce is the prime example.
A good combine can see players fly up the charts - bad ones can see players dip in power rankings. However, lots of teams make decisions not necessarily based on the on-field tests, but the ones off the field.

Front offices meet with countless prospects throughout the combine for interviews, some of which have turned infamous with some wild questions. For Kelce, one interview was practically over before it started.
A clip of Kelce explaining his ""bad interviews"" at the combine has resurfaced on social media. Even though it is a year old, it still offers insight into how some of the interviews go for highly touted prospects.
""At the combine, I had some bad interviews,"" Kelce said on his podcast with his brother, Jason.
However, one in particular seems like one the team wants back.
""The [Dallas] Cowboys, they were kind of pressing me about having this red flag of missing a year.""
Kelce was suspended an entire season due to a positive marijuana test while he was in New Orleans for the 2010 Sugar Bowl with Cincinnati.
""Travis"" and ""Kelce"" also made the top ranked dog names. (Michael Owens/Getty Images)
XAVIER WORTHY, NEW 40-YARD DASH RECORD HOLDER, REVEALS WHO HE 'MODELED MY GAME AFTER'
Despite Kelce trying to convince the Cowboys they had no reason to be concerned, the interview ""ended really fast.""
""I basically just said, 'If you guys think I'm gonna be that kind of guy, or you're questioning if I'm still that person after everything that I've battled through to get to where I am now from missing a season, then you guys (should) probably go somewhere else and pick somebody else.'""
The Cowboys selected Gavin Escobar with the 47th overall pick in 2013, while Kelce fell to 63, the first selection of the third round, by the Kansas City Chiefs.

Kelce, of course, may just be the best tight end of all time. Escobar, meanwhile, was out of the league by 2017 after playing just 62 games with the Cowboys, catching 30 passes for 333 yards and eight touchdowns - something Kelce can do in a several-week span.

Byron was forced to pit on Lap 47 after a trash bag blew onto the front of his car, and his engine overheated as high winds were an added obstacle for drivers.

Just weeks after hosting one of the biggest sporting events in the world, Allegiant Stadium will open its doors again this weekend to a different type of game that is guaranteed to attract NFL fans still looking for a thrill after Super Bowl LVIII.
The National Rugby League (NRL) will kick off its season for the first time on American soil on Saturday night, when the Manly Warringah Sea Eagles, South Sydney Rabbitohs, Sydney Roosters and Brisbane Broncos head to Las Vegas for a doubleheader at the Raiders’ stadium.
""We’re excited to bring our games to America,"" NRL CEO Andrew Abdo said of the campaign in December, via the Las Vegas Review-Journal. ""West Coast is important for us because of the time zone. These are opening week Premiership matches, so we’re going to have a huge audience back in Australia. Being on the West Coast allows us to play the games on a Saturday evening here while it goes onto prime time on a Sunday back in Australia.""

The four teams will be bringing rugby to American fans like never before in primetime.
Read below for more information on this weekend’s matchups and the NRL.

Comparisons between rugby and American football can easily be made. There is an offense and a defense and no shortage of physicality – but the two sports are more distant cousins than they are members of the same nuclear family.
For a breakdown of the rules, the NRL released a promotional video on X earlier this month narrated by Australian actor Russell Crowe.
""Arguably the fastest, most aggressive ball in hand football game that exists,"" Crowe, co-owner of South Sydney, explained.
VIEW POST ON X
As explained by the ""Gladiator"" actor, each team has 13 players on the field with just four on the bench playing in an 80-minute game with two halves. The game is played on a 100-meter field (approximately 110 yards) with an oval-shaped ball.
Among the notable differences include no pads, no timeouts and no forward passing, and every player can tackle, pass and kick the ball when necessary.
Instead of four downs, teams have six tackles to attempt to move the ball forward, and there are more scoring opportunities, which range from one point to four.

The NRL is composed of 17 teams that play 24 games across a 27-week season. The top eight teams advance to the NRL’s version of the postseason.
The league traces its roots back to 1908 and boasts itself as the most watched programs on Australian television, according to the NRL website. The league attracts around 3 million fans each year with more than 100 million more tuning in on television.

One of the fighters in the stands had his guard down as the fight seemed to be winding down, but his ""opponent"" tossed a left hook that landed square on his cheek, sending him flying to the ground.
The fan eventually stood up again, but he was wobbling as the fight began to stop.
During the fight, there’s no sign of security trying to step in and stop the brawl. UFC President Dana White commented on that aspect of the situation.

""The crazy thing about that fight [is], when that fight broke out, it felt like it kept going forever,"" White said after the event. ""I ran over there, and I was watching it. Nobody stopped it. I was waiting for security to come in. They just let them go until it was over. That’s one of the craziest things I’ve ever seen.""

White doesn’t feel it’s a bad look on his brand that the fight went to its conclusion.
""I don’t think it’s a bad look for the UFC. It happened and that was the end of that. I think after everybody else saw that s---, nobody else wanted to try that again. No security. The fight just went on until the fight was over. I’ve never seen any s--- like that in my life. Crazy.""
For the event itself, Mexicans Brandon Moreno and Yair Rodriguez were part of the co-main event that White put together.
Rodriguez wasn’t able to win his match against Brian Ortega, who made him submit in the third round. Rodriguez had previously won against Ortega via technical knockout, but Ortega got his revenge this time around.

"March 13, 2024 2:00am EDT",NB-AI generative tool promises to create innovative live game viewing experience for fans,Fox News,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
As the viewing habits of sports fans continue to shift, more and more sports leagues have attempted to give consumers new and innovative ways to engage with players and games.
A number of NBA fans use the league’s mobile app to watch their favorite team. Given the growing popularity of its digital platforms, the NBA is tapping into artificial intelligence to enhance fans' viewing experience.
During February's Tech Summit, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver demonstrated the AI technology that will likely alter the way fans interact with games whenever they opt to experience the league with the app.

""There is a need to see the NBA making strides to use AI,"" Alex Beckman told Fox News Digital. ""What we see is brands that have invested early — that have gotten a head start — (are) now making strides (into) that second and third tiers of AI and how it can touch fans.""
Beckman is the founder and CEO of ON, a leading AI chat platform which powers AI experiences for some of the world's most recognizable sports brands, including the New York Yankees and Las Vegas Aces.
FOX SPORTS EXPANDS GOOGLE CLOUD PARTNERSHIP, GENERATIVE AI TO AUTOMATE ARCHIVED SPORTS VIDEO SEARCH
While Silver provided a sneak peek at the technology, the league billed it as an engine that will drive a new, personalized experience when live games are viewed on the app.
While several details about the technology remain unknown, one of the features is expected to allow for full animation. Users would essentially have the ability to animate players or make it appear as though the game is a movie.

During one point of the demonstration, Silver asked the tool to transform the action of a live game ""as if it were a Spider-Man movie."" Just moments later, players turned into cartoon characters, dramatic music began playing and digital effects associated with the popular comic book were added.
""Today, AI is creating a similar excitement to what we saw around the early days of the internet,"" Silver said during the experimental preview.
""Intuitively, most of us have a sense that artificial intelligence is going to change our lives.""

For now, consumers typically engage with AI via widely available means, such as the text-based ChatGPT or popular voice-assisted tools like Siri and Google Assistant. However, tech companies such as OpenAI are pushing the focus to video that is generated by a variety of algorithms. Earlier this year, OpenAI teased its next model, Sora.
WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?
The technology presents several pros and cons. For instance, some have raised concerns about whether AI could be used to potentially circumvent athlete NIL rights by using AI versions instead. On the positive side, AI can help ramp up healthy competition between sports leagues and teams to utilize next-generation entertainment options to increase fans' engagement.
The future of AI has been a hot topic since the technology became more widely accessible to the general public in late 2022.
""There's been a conversation for a long time about what is (AI)? And is it safe? The brands that got their heads around that early are now having successful launches and innovations on top of that … first layer of interaction. And it's nice to see the NBA leading in that category,"" Beckman noted.

Wembanyama described NB-AI as ""incredible."" Although NB-AI is in its infancy, the French phenom believes the coming months and years will play a significant role in the technology's development.
""Only the future will say what it will look like,"" Wembanyama added.

The Denver Broncos have agreed to send 2020 first-round pick Jerry Jeudy to the Cleveland Browns in exchange for two draft picks, per ESPN’s Adam Schefter.
Schefter adds the Broncos will receive a 2024 fifth-round pick and sixth-round pick from the Browns in exchange for Jeudy.
The deal will not be made official until the new league year begins on March 13.

The Browns previously tried trading for Jeudy at last year’s NFL trade deadline, but both sides couldn’t come to an agreement. The interest remained in Cleveland, and this time, the price was right.
Jeudy’s trade interest has been apparent for quite some time across the league. By doing so now, the Broncos are saving $12.987 million in 2024 cap space, making it a win-win for both sides. Jeudy gets his fresh start on the final year of his rookie deal, while Denver creates more room to work with as free agency approaches on March 13.
BRONCOS LEGEND KARL MECKLENBERG TEES OFF ON RUSSELL WILSON: ‘ISN’T A LEADER'
Jeudy was the 15th overall pick in the 2020 Draft out of Alabama, a speedy 6-foot-1, 193-pound receiver who shined with over 1,000 yards receiving in back-to-back college campaigns.
However, Jeudy’s NFL career hasn’t seen a 1,000-yard season yet, and several factors roll into that.
The first was inconsistent quarterback play since Jeudy arrived in Denver. He did have 113 targets his rookie season with numerous quarterbacks at the helm, including Drew Lock, Jeff Driskel and Brett Rypien. He caught 52 of those targets for 856 yards with three touchdowns.

Injuries played a factor in his 467 yards and no touchdowns in 2021, starting just five games and playing in 10.
When Russell Wilson came aboard in 2022, Jeudy’s stock rose with career bests in receptions (67), yards (972) and touchdowns (6). But this came during a brutal year for the Broncos, a team expected to be better with Wilson leading the offense, however finished 5-12 on the year.
Courtland Sutton supplanted Jeudy as the top Broncos target last season, as the latter finished with 758 yards on 54 catches (87 targets) with two touchdowns over 16 games. The Broncos’ offense as a whole was a conservative group that relied heavily on the run game to get the job down in another playoff-less season.
Jeudy heads to a Browns team that has firepower all over the offense, though what quarterback Deshaun Watson can do with it remains to be seen after his lackluster second season with Cleveland ended early due to a shoulder injury.

Duke star Kyle Filipowski had to be helped off the court after Saturday’s incident. It appeared a fan made contact with him running from the left side of the court. The fan who appeared to hit Filipowski fell to the court, and Filipowski somehow ended up in the arms of Duke staff.
Duke coach Jon Scheyer said Filipowski sprained his ankle, and the coach called for court storming to end.

The Atlanta Falcons’ social media team reminded fans on Sunday they do not control the organization’s moves during free agency, as clubs will be able to enter contract negotiations with players on Monday.
The Falcons’ X account posted a still shot from ""The Office"" featuring Rainn Wilson’s Dwight Schrute and John Krasinski’s Jim Halpert.

""We don’t make free agency decisions,"" Krasinski’s sign read. ""We just announce them.""
It was a good reminder as the negotiation period began. Any deals agreed upon can officially be announced on Wednesday when the new league year begins. The Falcons are expected to be one of the teams in the mix for a new quarterback when free agency begins.
Kirk Cousins could be the target.
The Minnesota Vikings quarterback is expected to be a free agent, and though the Vikings could still be in play, Pro Football Talk reported last week the quarterback is ""seriously considering moving his family to Atlanta."" Furthermore, Bleacher Report reported that the Falcons are considered to be a ""major contender"" to sign Cousins.

Cousins had 2,331 passing yards and 18 touchdown passes in eight games before he suffered a season-ending Achilles tear. He spent the rest of the year rehabbing the injury.
The veteran quarterback told Fox News Digital he hoped to remain with the Vikings if possible.
""I sure hope so,"" he said in January. ""We’ll have to see how it all plays out. I think this league, if I’ve learned anything in my 12 years, is that a lot of curveballs get thrown, and it’s hard to predict what happens next month. This injury taught me that, too.

"March 6, 2024 5:46pm EST",New York county exec sues AG James over his trans athletes ban in women's sports,Fox News,"Nassau County, New York, Executive Bruce Blakeman defends his order in an appearance on OutKick's 'Gaines for Girls' podcast.
An elected official in a New York City suburb is suing state Attorney General Letitia James to block her from preventing his order that bans transgender athletes from competing against biological females in sporting events at facilities within his county.
Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman is suing James over her cease-and-desist letter regarding the matter and is asking a federal court in the Eastern District of New York to rule that he has the power to implement the ban.
The lawsuit stems from a Feb. 22 executive order issued by Blakeman that forbids trans athletes from competing against biological females at Nassau County facilities, including parks and other county property.
RILEY GAINES CALLS SUSPENSION OF COLLEGE'S INVESTIGATION INTO HER HOSTAGE ASSAULT ‘AN ABOMINATION’
Nassau County, New York, Executive Bruce Blakeman has asked a federal court to affirm that he has the power to implement the ban prohibiting transgender athletes from participating in girl's and women's sports competitions.  (AP Photo/Philip Marcelo)
""We set forth this policy because of the unfair competitive advantage that males have,"" Blakeman said Wednesday during a news conference at his Mineola, Long Island, office. ""They’re bigger, faster and stronger. It’s a scientific fact.""
Blakeman and parents Marc and Jeanine Mullen, who are plaintiffs in the lawsuit and whose 16-year-old daughter competes in women’s volleyball in Nassau County, said an ""unfair playing field is created when a biological male competes against biological females, and further recognizing the risk of serious injury to biological females.""
""By this action, the plaintiffs seek to prevent the defendants from doing exactly what it is that they have alleged the County of Nassau and County Executive Bruce A. Blakeman have done: unconstitutionally discriminating against individuals on the basis of gender in the limited and narrow context of sporting events,"" the lawsuit states.
Blakeman’s order requires any sports teams, leagues, programs or organizations seeking a permit from the county’s parks and recreation department to state the athletes' ""biological sex at birth.""
TRANS INCLUSION IN WOMEN'S SPORTS BECOMES HOTTER TOPIC IN 2023

Having biological males compete against females creates an unfair and dangerous environment since biological men are generally stronger and faster than women, the complaint said. Those differences are not erased just because someone has sex reassignment surgery, according to the lawsuit.
""If biological men are allowed to compete with biological females, it erases all the hard-earned progress and — more importantly — creates an unsafe and dangerous environment for those biological females to play in,"" it said.
""Just last month it was reported that a girls basketball team went so far as to forfeit a game because a transgender girl injured three girls and the coach felt compelled to terminate his team’s participation in order to prevent further injury to the biologically female athletes by the 6-foot-tall biologically male transgender player,"" the complaint said.
A spokesperson for James' office told Fox News Digital that Blakeman's order is ""transphobic.""
CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP
""County Executive Blakeman’s executive order is transphobic and discriminatory. Our laws protect New Yorkers from discrimination, and the Office of the Attorney General is committed to upholding those laws and protecting our communities,"" said the spokeperson.
""This is not up for debate: the executive order is illegal, and it will not stand in New York.""
Blakeman defended his lawsuit in an interview with OutKick contributor Riley Gaines on the ""Gaines for Girls"" podcast.
He pushed back against James' claim that the lawsuit is transphobic, saying women are a protected class, and he feels that James is not living up to her responsibility to protect women.

Some future Hall of Famers, like Derek Jeter and Kobe Bryant, announce their impending retirement before or during a season, resulting in a ""farewell tour.""
Sue Bird did the same in her final season in the WNBA two years ago.
Bird announced in the middle of the 2022 season that she would retire upon that season's end, giving fans and teams alike a chance to bid their farewells to the WNBA legend.

LeBron James, though, recently claimed he was ""50-50"" on the idea.
Well, Bird says James absolutely should have one.
""When I look back, I still have fond, fond, fond memories. I wouldn't change a thing. I'm so glad I announced when I announced, and I got to experience the farewell tour. And I was actually anti that at one point a couple of years prior, so that was interesting for me to experience it in that way…"" Bird said on the Sports Media podcast.
""If I talked to LeBron right now, I'd be like 'Bro, I could not recommend this enough.'""
Bird admitted she was unsure if she wanted all the attention, but she did say she felt she owed it to the fans to appreciate her one final time.

""You have to almost see outside of yourself and understand that this is going to be meaningful for so many people,"" she said.
Bird did say such a tour could be overwhelming, ""but I just think the pros outweigh the cons.""
It seems that the all-time leading scorer's mind is exactly where Bird's is considering a farewell.
""There’s times when I feel like I guess I owe it to my fans that have been along this journey with me for two decades plus, to be able to give them that moment where it’s every city and whatever the case may be and they give you your flowers or whatever the case may be. That seems cool,"" he said at All-Star weekend.

Duke star Kyle Filipowski is still feeling the aftermath of Saturday's loss to Wake Forest.
That is because the star actually injured his knee when a fan storming the court collided with him just mere seconds after the Demon Deacons' 83-79 win.
At first, head coach Jon Scheyer said Filipowski sprained his ankle, but it turns out it was a right knee injury. He had to be helped off by several members of the Duke staff.

""He’s just not 100 percent after what happened. He’s not himself,"" Scheyer said on ""Fast Break with Jon Scheyer"" on Monday night. ""Hopefully, he takes another step (Tuesday) and he can be ready for Wednesday.""
As the fan made contact, it appeared Filipowski extended his arms - the fan who made contact fell to the floor, while the Duke star narrowly missed harder contact from other court-stormers.
Filipowski believed the incident was ""personal"" and ""intentional.""

NFL star wide receiver Mike Evans has spent his entire professional football career in one place. But, the 30-year-old's future with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers appears to be in doubt.
Although Evans has consistently expressed his desire to stay in Tampa, he will likely explore his options on the free agent market, according to a report from The Athletic. Evans is scheduled to enter free agency later this month at the start of the NFL's new league year.
Evans and his representatives were believed to be working towards a contract extension, but talks with the Buccaneers have reportedly stalled. So, Evans will now listen to other teams before deciding where he will play in 2024.

He agreed to a five-year contract extension with the Bucs back in 2018.

It seems that the see-through pants are the last straw for MLB players regarding their new uniforms.
Nike and Major League Baseball have caught flack for the new baseball jerseys this year due to their ""cheap"" look - that is what pitchers Rich Hill and Miles Mikolas said of the uniforms, despite other players promoting their stretchiness and lighter feel.
Their sentiments seemed legitimate when photos surfaced of tucked-in jerseys clearly visible through white pants. Plus, when San Francisco Giants' Casey Schmitt had his photoshoot, his lower region was clearly visible.

Now, players are going to the MLBPA in hopes of a change before Opening Day on March 28.
""It's disappointing that we've landed in a place where the uniforms are the topic of discussion,"" MLBPA executive director Tony Clark said Thursday, via ESPN. ""Each conversation with the guys is yielding more information with what we're seeing.""

""A lot of the rhetoric is confirmation that the pants are see-through,"" Clark added, saying that the pants are a ""universal concern.""
""It's been an ongoing conversation where each day has yielded something new that doesn't seem to make as much sense as you would like it.""
The last names on the back of jerseys look noticeably smaller, leading to most fans complaining about them. However, MLB senior vice president of global consumer products Denis Nolan maintained that the uniforms are top-notch.
""In acquiring Majestic and its MLB uniform manufacturing facilities in Easton, PA -- which have been making player uniforms for nearly two decades -- Fanatics has consistently produced world-class uniforms, including every Nike-branded MLB on-field jersey and all City Connect gear since 2020,"" Nolan said, via MLB.com.
The league tested the uniforms on hundreds of players, debuting them in last year's All-Star Game to favorable reviews. Fanatics actually measured every player last year, and Nike body-scanned over 300 players to get the ideal fit.

As a finalist for the Hall himself, Willis knew exactly what Young, the camera crew and everyone else present meant: He was voted into the Hall of Fame.

After the smiles and laughs came the waterworks for Willis, who spoke to Fox News Digital after reflecting on that moment when he learned he was heading to Canton, Ohio.
""One thing I can say now: To be voted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, no one can take that away from me,"" Willis said while discussing his love for CoachTube.
This was the third year Willis became a finalist, and after missing out twice, the thought naturally creeps in the brain: Is what I did good enough?
HALL OF FAME CANDIDATE PATRICK WILLIS TALKS STEPPING AWAY FROM NFL IN HIS PRIME, WOULD DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN
Willis knows he was a great player during his career from 2007 as the 11th overall pick out of Ole Miss to San Fran. But he played eight seasons, ending his career surprisingly after the 2014 campaign.
He no longer needs to think about the what-ifs.
""We always used to say at the end of the year when you look up on the stat sheet and see how many sacks you have, or how many interceptions, or how many tackles, they don’t recall how you got them,"" Willis explained. ""They just see you got them. It’s kinda what this feels like to me now that I don’t have that feeling like, ‘Man, what else did I have to prove?’""
Willis told Fox News Digital prior to being voted into the Hall that he always played the game wanting ""to be one of them,"" referring to the legends that are forever enshrined in Canton with their gold busts.
""If one person could remember me, that would be awesome. It seems like a little bit more than one is remembering, so I’m grateful for that,"" he said.
But walking away from the game at 30 years old was no easy task for Willis. He knew it was time, especially after playing just six games during the regular season in his final year.

As he looks back, there’s still no regret.
""At the end of the day, for what it’s worth, you can always say what if, or you should have,"" he explained. ""But I was blessed to play the time I was given, and the results were what they were, and I’ll say judge me off those and not by what you think I could’ve done. If you’re going off those numbers, perhaps they’re good enough.
""At the end of the day, it’s up to those who are voting.""
The voters believes the 950 combined tackles, 733 of which were solo, 20.5 sacks, 16 forced fumbles and eight interceptions, two of which resulted in pick-sixes, were enough.
Willis admitted, ""I don’t know what I’m going to say, or how I’m going to say it,"" when he walks up on that podium at Hall of Fame Stadium later this year. He’s sure the emotions will be there, too.

Though he enjoyed how defensive the game was, considering that is the side of the ball he knows best, Willis did not like the end result as the 49ers fell to the Chiefs in overtime.

It was not a perfect performance, but in just his second season and his first Super Bowl, Purdy was making good reads, running when he needed to get first downs and showing former players like Willis why NFL defenses respect him each time he hits the field.
The ""game manager"" tag was placed on him all season, especially when the 49ers entered the playoffs. However, as one of the best linebackers to strap on pads in the NFL, Willis explained why he tips his cap to Purdy.
""To see him just lead the guys as he did, to deal with his adversities the way he did, and handle it and speak about it,"" Willis said.

""I can honestly say as a defender [thinking about] a quarterback such as Purdy and to see the way he goes about it, he’s one of the ones that every time you play against him you’re going to have to come with it every single time because he has that faith that he’s going to do what he has to do to have his team be successful. As a defender, you got to love that in a quarterback.""
The 49ers certainly love what Purdy brings to the table, even if they finished second in the end. From a front office standpoint, GM John Lynch used his final draft pick in 2023 to select the Iowa State product, and he quickly developed into their franchise quarterback. That means a low cost for years to come to keep veteran weapons around him and balance the roster elsewhere.
For head coach Kyle Shanahan, Purdy's style of play fits his offense perfectly, and that has quickly become apparent since he took over the starting role midway through his rookie season.
Of course, Purdy's development is far from over. Year three is when the usual leap comes for great players in the NFL who understand what it takes to play through a grueling season with the best the game has to offer.

However, Purdy has support within the building, as well as those like Willis who used to wear gold and red during their careers.
As Purdy and the rest of the 49ers gear up for another season, Willis will be working on what to say at his Pro Football Hall of Fame induction ceremony in Canton, Ohio, later this season.
Willis, who racked up 950 combined tackles over his eight seasons with the 49ers, will forever be enshrined in the Hall with the best to ever grace the gridiron – an accomplishment that means the world to him.
""One thing I can say now: To be voted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, no one can take that away from me,"" he said.

""We always used to say at the end of the year when you look up on the stat sheet and see how many sacks you have, or how many interceptions, or how many tackles, they don’t recall how you got them. They just see you got them. It’s kinda what this feels like to me now that I don’t have that feeling like, ‘Man, what else did I have to prove?’""

The latest controversy came as Rodgers was named on Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s short list for running mates as he embarks on an independent presidential campaign against the presumptive major party nominees – Joe Biden and Donald Trump.
Pat McAfee, a close confidant of Rodgers, revealed on his ESPN show that Rodgers was in Costa Rica on yet another ayahuasca retreat when the news broke. He was seen in photos with newest Miami Dolphins defensive back Jordan Poyer in the Central American nation.
Both players have openly discussed their use of the drug, with the quarterback crediting it for his MVPs in 2020 and 2021.

"March 2, 2024 3:48pm EST",Former NBA star Kevin Garnett references LeBron James in unfounded PED claim,Fox News,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Kevin Garnett stepped away from the NBA after the 2015-16 season. His career spanned more than two decades, and during that time, Garnett had numerous head-to-head battles on the basketball court against LeBron James.
James is in the midst of his 21st season in the NBA and is still playing at a high level. James enters Saturday night's game against the defending champion Denver Nuggets just nine points shy of 40,000 career points.
James' oldest son, Bronny, has been a topic of conversation in recent days. As the college basketball regular season comes to a close, there have been more and more questions about whether USC freshman Bronny will declare for the 2024 NBA Draft, but the elder James recently took issue with a mock draft that excluded Bronny.

""Can yall please just let the kid be a kid and enjoy college basketball,"" the Los Angeles Lakers superstar wrote on X, the company formerly known as Twitter. ""The work and results will ultimately do the talking no matter what he decides to do. If y’all don’t know he doesn’t care what a mock draft says, he just WORKS! Earned Not Given!""
At one point during a recent episode of the ""KG CERTIFIED w/ Kevin Garnett"" podcast, Garnett began discussing how Bronny would project as an NBA player.
LEBRON JAMES BLASTS COVERAGE AROUND BRONNY DESPITE SAYING HE COULD PLAY FOR LAKERS 'EASY'
""Bronny can get a bucket on Bron,"" NBA champion Paul Pierce asserted.
Garnett quickly pushed back saying, ""No, no, no he can’t.""
""Man, c’mon, that little dude is explosive,"" Pierce responded.

But Garnett's argument about James being able to prevent Bronny from scoring during a hypothetical game did not center around age, size, or experience. Instead, Garnett suggested that James used steroids.
""His dad on that BALCO, he on that new juice,"" Garnett said.

Garnett did not offer any additional context or information to support the claim he made on the podcast.
Fox News Digital contacted James' representatives. Emails seeking comment did not immediately receive a response.
James, notably, has never failed a drug test during his lengthy professional basketball career. He had previously been embroiled in a PED-related controversy when documents surfaced linking some of James' associates to the Biogenesis scandal.
The 2013 federal Biogenesis probe, which the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents unofficially referred to as ""Operation Strikeout,"" resulted in the conviction of Anthony Bosch, a self-described biochemist, and several associates.

The DEA ultimately cleared James following the probe. James was also cleared following ESPN's 2023 report on the Biogenesis investigation.

With the Philadelphia Eagles' run to a second-straight Super Bowl appearance ending abruptly, there's long been rumors about drama in the locker room.
The Eagles started last season 10-1 and lost six of their final seven games, getting eliminated in the wild-card round of the playoffs by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
Speculation has pointed to A.J. Brown, who has been seen angry on the sidelines and has pointed the finger right back at the media.
Brown didn't speak much to reporters during the team's losing streak as reports swirled he was dividing the locker room.

But Brown decided to call WIP radio in Philadelphia to address afternoon drive hosts Ike Reese and Jack Fritz.
Brown said he wanted to confront the hosts because of the rumors they've been ""making up.""
""You guys are supposed to support Philly, but it doesn’t turn out to be that. Why make up so many rumors? Most of the rumors don’t even be real rumors. These are rumors that you guys are making up, and everybody ran with,"" Brown said on the show.
But Reese, a former Eagle, said it wasn't them specifically reporting anything. Instead, Reese said, they often talk about hypotheticals and reports to kill time and create content for a four-hour show five days a week.
Brown understood where Reese was coming from but still directed his anger toward the Philadelphia media, saying he feels he is misunderstood and has been personally singled out.
""It gets frustrating because anything I say or do, it gets magnified times 10. I’m classified as a diva. I want the ball, this and that, blah blah blah. But when it’s the other way around — you’ve seen me get upset on the sideline, and you automatically think it’s about targets. No, what if I’m holding my players accountable? What if I’m the guy that pushes everybody in the locker room, makes people uncomfortable to try to better themselves and the team? What if I’m that guy? You don’t see it as much from Jalen, because that’s not his personality.

""But, honestly, I’m the person you need on the team because I’m going to hold people accountable, make people around me better, but nobody sees that. All you see is the little flare-ups and stuff like that. I can honestly say, you see the flare-ups because nobody in that building works harder than me.
""Nobody in that building prepares harder than me, more than me. I can stand on that and say that. That’s why you see the passion. That’s why you see me react the way I act. Because nobody’s spending that time like me. I know for a fact. I’m misunderstood. I’m not even trying to be understood by people because you’re not going to understand me, because you’re not in my shoes.""

Reese replied that people do want to ""understand"" Brown, but Brown disagreed.
""I’m human. I may not do it the best way every single time, but that’s who I am, that’s who I’m forever going to be until I’m six feet under the ground. That’s who I am. I’m not going to change who I am. So, if you don’t like it, you just don’t like it.
""So, you might as well get in line with the rest of the people. … I’m my own person, and I’m not afraid to speak up. And that’s what I think scares a lot of people. I had the b---s to get on your show today. I know my worth, I know what I bring to the table.""

PHILADELPHIA – Philadelphia 76ers limited partner David Adelman ushers this journalist to the front of the Horwitz-Wasserman Holocaust Memorial Plaza at 16th and Arch Streets, at the head of the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, and tells him to look down.
""Read this,"" Adelman says, taking a step back to allow time to soak in the important scripture on the tablet.
The first two sentences hit like a ton of bricks.

""Sam Wasserman's story of Holocaust survival is one of both tragedy and hope. He was imprisoned by the Nazis in 1942 at Sobibor in Poland, where he lost his first wife and two children,"" the tablet reads.
Wasserman was Adelman's grandfather, and one can tell that walking the grounds still has a profound effect on Adelman today, even after the plaza was completed in October 2018, centering around the oldest public Holocaust monument in North America: the ""Monument to Six Million Jewish Martyrs"" sculpture.
So, when a vandal spray-painted a green swastika on a wall in January, Adelman had visceral reaction.

""I was f---ing pissed,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""I wasn’t surprised, but I was pissed. It’s unfortunate I wasn’t surprised.""
Adelman said he wanted to leave the hate crime up on the wall for a few days ""because no one will believe it happened. They'll say it was manufactured or whatever.""
""We took it down, but I was f---ing pissed,"" he said.
Adelman knew he needed to do something, so the billionaire businessman and entrepreneur went to social media.

""Unconditional compassion is a core tenet in my life so I am compelled to take action following the antisemitic vandalism that defaced the @Philly Holocaust Memorial Plaza on Sunday,"" he posted to X.
""I have spent the last two decades championing the Horwitz-Wasserman Holocaust Plaza and Philadelphia Holocaust Remembrance Foundation’s mission of educating people on the atrocities of the past, while working toward a future of tolerance and enlightenment,"" he continued. ""To know that a plaza, that was named for my grandfather, a Holocaust survivor, was vandalized with such hate, proves just how much these types of memorials and educational opportunities are needed and the compassion still lacking in our communities.""
""This heartbreakingly one of many acts of antisemitism that is part of a staggering spike in anti-Jewish hatred in Philadelphia and across the country. These types of acts are dangerous and will not be tolerated so I am partnering with @PhillyTipLine to offer a reward to anyone that has information that will help us identify the vandal and hold them accountable for their actions. Please call the Citizens Crime Commission tip line 215-546-TIPS (8477).""
More than a month later, the vandal has not been caught, though Adelman said that was not unexpected given that the security cameras only showed a man with a mask.
""I just decided in general I’m not going to hide. … I’m not going to stand still,"" he said about posting on social media about the vandalism.
""If someone did it to a church and put some inappropriate thing, I would stand up for that, too. I just don’t believe in this stuff.""
‘WE JUST WANT OUR INNOCENT PEOPLE BACK’: SISTER OF HAMAS HOSTAGE PLEADS FOR HER RELEASE
The 51-year-old noted how he tapped into his Jewish heritage after college, though he learned a lot of hard knowledge from his grandparents about the Holocaust since he was a child. Alan Horwitz, his mentor and the lead donor of the Holocaust plaza, was a key figure in Adelman wanting to help the community this way.
""When I saw the amount of Holocaust survivors were dwindling by the day, it’s a crazy stat that no one believes – 30% of Philadelphia’s Jewish population lives at or below the poverty line, 30%,"" he said. ""I guessed like 8%. It really is a lot of elderly people who are Holocaust survivors living in these dilapidated homes, and they don’t really take care of it but are too proud to go into assisted living and stuff like that. For me, I saw that, and I was like, ‘This doesn’t sit right with me.’ That was kind of like the way I got engaged.""
David Adelman speaks with kid at a team event. (Philadelphia 76ers)
Adelman is co-founder of the Jewish Federation Real Estate Group, and rose through the ranks of the Jewish Federation of Philadelphia to become chair. And in these positions, Adelman has realized the unfortunate reality of today's social climate: Antisemitism is very real.
Just months earlier, when the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel shocked the world with more than 1,200 deaths and approximately 250 Israeli civilians and soldiers taken hostage into the Gaza Strip, the 76ers released a statement to show their support for Israel.
Adelman said 76ers managing partners Josh Harris and David Blitzer, who are also Jewish, were in lock step wanting to put a post out on Oct. 8.
""I think, one, Josh and David as managing partners of the team, they were united in putting a post out,"" Adelman said. ""Josh was very influential, both in the NBA, NHL and NFL, in voicing his opinion, ‘This needs to get out there.’ I was obviously very supportive about it. And I’m glad we did it.""
The post received mixed reactions from Sixers fans, though, some of whom responded ""L"" or ""Oh man"" in the comments.
It didn't faze Adelman one bit.
""I think you have to take a stand for things, and at that point, if we have fans [who] don’t want to watch a team that’s owned by Jewish owners, then there’s other teams,"" he said.

"February 24, 2024 12:06am EST",Steve Kerr agrees to record-breaking contract extension with Warriors: report,Fox News,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Steve Kerr is staying in Bay Area for just a bit longer.
The Golden State Warriors have reportedly agreed to a record-breaking two-year, $35 million extension with their head coach.
Kerr's deal would go into effect next season, as his current contract was set to expire following this season, reports ESPN.

His $17.5 million annual value will be the highest ever given to a coach.
The 58-year-old Kerr recently won his 500th game and has guided Golden State to four championships with a star-studded roster led by Stephen Curry, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson.
The season has not gone as planned for the Warriors this season though - amid struggles, Thompson has been moved to the bench.
Green also was suspended indefinitely by the NBA due to repeated hard fouls and unruly behavior on the floor - before last season started, Green punched then-teammate Jordan Poole from point-blank range at practice.
But the struggles clearly do not outweigh the dynastic fortune the Warriors have had since the 2014-15 season, which was their first of four titles since then.

Since Kerr has coached the Warriors, they have been to six total Finals - they blew a 3-1 lead to the Cleveland Cavaliers after their record-breaking 73-9 season, which was the catalyst to bringing in Kevin Durant. They also lost to the Toronto Raptors in 2019.
He is 501-264 since joining the Warriors.

Thursday's men's basketball game between Temple and UAB is set to be reviewed by the Philly school after a gambling watchdog group flagged the contest for unusual gambling behavior shortly before tipoff.
The Blazers opened up as a 1.5-point favorite, but the spread suddenly increased to make them favored by eight. Temple eventually closed as seven-point underdogs.
UAB won, 100-72, making it a sweat-free cover.

Jay Kornegay, the race and sports manager at Westgate Las Vegas, said once the line reached 7, the money was even on both sides, typically an indication a game is on the level.
Oddly enough, although it seems fishy, and likely, that lots of wagers were placed on UAB ahead of the game to dramatically change the spread, Kornegay said he ""didn't see anything suspicious.""
""We looked at it closely to monitor any type of injury late,"" Kornegay said of the Temple-UAB game. ""But when we looked at the box score, everyone played. It's a big move and that's not normal, but we didn't see anything suspicious.""

""We are aware of the media reports regarding last night's men's basketball game,"" Temple said Friday in a statement. ""We will review the reports thoroughly in accordance with university and NCAA policies. While we can't comment any further at this time, we take this matter very seriously.""
The growth of legal sports betting in the U.S., especially among college-aged people, has prompted concerns about increased stress on athletes and raised the potential for wrongdoing. NCAA president Charlie Baker said earlier this year the NCAA is trying to modify ""draconian"" penalties that college athletes face for breaking rules regarding betting on sports.

Calling Ryan Leaf a bust isn't as effective as it used to be.
Leaf was the second pick of the 1998 NFL Draft, behind Peyton Manning, by the San Diego Chargers, and he's widely regarded as the biggest bust in NFL history.
A combination of poor play, injuries and bad behavior led to his career ending in 2001 after just 25 games.

Leaf has had to accept the harsh reality, but more than 20 years later, it's not much of a concern anymore.
Active on social media, Leaf responded to a post on X, formerly Twitter that read, ""From what I remember Ryan Leaf absolutely LOVED to take receipts when he was in the league.""
Leaf said that was not the case, but had he done so, ""I could have talked a lot of s--t.""
The original post did not tag Leaf, nor does Leaf follow the account, so another user, dubbed Soap, asked him why he was ""searching"" his own name on the platform.
That's when Leaf went to school.

Soap wasn't finished, though, asking Leaf, ""Does your daughter know you're a bust.""
That prompted plenty of backlash by other social media users, which included calling Soap a ""coward,"" a ""jerk,"" and a ""disappointment,"" among other insults long and short.
But Leaf dropped the mic.
""She’s 14 weeks, she’ll find out, there are a--holes like you everywhere eager to shout it from the basements. I think the being a drug addict and 7 time convicted felon may be the harder conversation, but we trudge on!"" he answered.

In the thread, Leaf attributed ""service to others"" as the ""biggest credit"" to turning his life around.
Leaf will always be synonymous with the worst term in sports, but it's no secret he's done his best to live his best life, as he's started a foundation for mental health, and has been sober for over 12 years.

An attorney representing Miami Dolphins wide receiver Tyreek Hill is denying allegations made by a social media influencer that the star wideout broke her leg during a football drill at his Florida home last summer, calling her recent lawsuit a ""scare tactic.""
Sophie Hall claimed in a lawsuit filed in Broward County last week that Hill ""forcefully and purposefully"" shoved her after the two were participating in a ""friendly football lesson,"" where Hall claimed to have ""humiliated"" the NFL player when she knocked him backward.

""Defendant Hill asked Ms. Hall to stand in a defensive line stance while he stood opposite her in an offensive lineman stance, ‘hiked’ the ball to the quarterback, and told her to rush him as if she wanted to chase the quarterback,"" the lawsuit states.
CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM
""Ms. Hall did as instructed and on contact with the Defendant, caused Hill to be pushed backwards, garnering laughter from the witnesses present at the time, including the Defendant’s mother, sister, friend and trainer.""
Hill then allegedly ""charged into her violently and with great force, resulting in significant and serious injuries"" on a later play, leading to Hall’s injuries.
""The crushing force was so great that she sustained a right leg fracture, necessitating surgery with metal hardware implantation,"" the lawsuit continued.

DOLPHINS' TYREEK HILL SUED BY INFLUENCER CLAIMING HE BROKE HER LEG AFTER BEING 'HUMILIATED' IN FOOTBALL DRILLS
But an attorney representing the Dolphins star is disputing Hall’s allegations, stating that she tripped over a dog while participating in the practice session, causing her to fall and sustain an injury, according to an ESPN report.
Julius B. Collins told the outlet that he believes the lawsuit was filed to ""generate bad publicity for Mr. Hill in an attempt to 'scare tactic' him into personally covering the cost of Ms. Hall's medical bills.""
Collins also accused Hall's counsel of purposefully omitting the information about the dog from her original complaint. According to ESPN, the complaint mentions that a dog had disrupted a drill, but did not say that it had caused Hall to fall.

Hill and Hall had met in May 2023 after she had bought a ticket for her 10-year-old son to attend Hill's summer football camp in Boca Raton, Florida. Hill then messaged the woman on social media the next day and later shared his cellphone number with Hall and invited her to his home.

Dolphins general manager Chris Grier told reporters at the NFL Combine on Wednesday that the team was aware of the allegations but could not comment further.
""We were in communication with NFL security, so I really can’t comment on anything of that until we get all our information and find out what happened. For us, Tyreek has been a good addition for us, but in terms of all the off-field stuff, we’ll have to get all the information before we can really comment on it.""

Texas Tech Red Raiders fans littered their own home court on Tuesday night in the second half of their 81-69 loss to the Texas Longhorns, and it cost their team some points.
The incident occurred with about 10:16 left in the game. Longhorns forward Brock Cunningham delivered a hard check to Texas Tech guard Darrion Williams, knocking him out of bounds. As officials reviewed the play, Texas Tech fans threw objects, including water bottles, onto the court.

Big 12 officials reviewed the play and assessed a Flagrant 2 foul on Cunningham, which led to his ejection. Texas Tech was also assessed a technical foul because of its fans’ behavior. It prompted Texas Tech head coach Grant McCasland to get on the microphone and tell fans to stop it.
""We all know what's at stake in this game,"" McCasland told reporters after the game, via the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal. ""There's a lot going on. There's a lot of passion in this game. When you have to go talk on the mic, you're talking to 15-plus-thousand people, but really, you're talking to a couple people that are doing things that are completely unacceptable.
""You could tell when I finally communicated clearly, like, this can't happen, a lot of people were applauding because they know it's not what we need to do, and it cost us technicals, and it caused us a problem.

""But you know what comes with this great place is there's a lot of passion, and unfortunately I thought the decisions of a few people impacted everybody and that's not what this is about, and we'll get better because of it.""
Texas coach Rodney Terry said he told officials he was thinking of taking his players off of the floor.
He also commended McCasland for getting on the PA to talk to the fans.
""Some coaches won't do that,"" Terry said. ""He did that. Kudos to him. Proud of him. Proud of coach Grant. He's a man of a lot of character and a good man who's done a great job coaching his team.""

"February 22, 2024 6:45am EST",Where Anthony Rendon ranks among the 9 worst active MLB contracts,Fox News,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Anthony Rendon said this week that his family and his faith are his top priorities in life. Baseball did not reach such a status.
Sure, baseball may not be a ""top priority,"" but one could ask whether Rendon even cares about baseball at all, given his playing time, or lack thereof, over the last few years.
After finishing in third place in the NL MVP vote and winning a World Series in 2019 with the Washington Nationals, Rendon signed a seven-year, $245 million deal with the Los Angeles Angels. Rendon played in 52 of the 60 games in the truncated 2020 season, but since the start of 2021, he has played in just 148 games.
Rendon's contract is right up there with one of the worst in the game, and his recent comments about baseball not being a ""top priority"" caught him some flak, mostly due to his inability to stay on the field.
So, with Rendon putting himself in headlines, we wondered where Rendon's deal ranks among some of the worst deals that still have some time on them. So, this will not include Chris Davis, but it sure will include Rendon.
The dollar amount represents the total throughout their deals.
CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM

There is a lot of time left in this deal (which arguably should make it higher), but it was less than two years ago when the lefty was a Cy Young Award candidate, so we'll give him and the Yankees the benefit of the doubt here.
But it's so far, so bad. The oft-injured Rodon signed a six-year, $162 million deal last offseason but began his Yankees tenure on the injured list. In just his third start in pinstripes, he was jawing at Yankee fans on the road. In his final start, he allowed eight runs in the first inning, ballooning his ERA to 6.85, and he turned his back on the coaching staff during a mound visit.
Rodon has been the talk of Yankees camp though, looking slimmer and much more determined. Again, he had a 2.67 ERA in 2021 and 2022 combined, but if the New York pressure is getting to him on the road that quickly, this deal doesn't bode all too well.
For obvious reasons, this could, and maybe should, be higher. Franco, of course, is under investigation for a relationship with a minor and allegedly paying off her mother with money and gifts. It is an awful scenario, and there is certainly a chance that Franco doesn't play in the majors ever again, let alone step foot in the United States.
The Rays, known for strapping money to themselves, inked their superstar when he was just 21 to an 11-year deal worth over $180 million with a club option for a 12th. It was a gamble the Rays took and were praised for.
But the reason for this ranking is, unlike other bad contracts where prior injuries were somewhat predictable, no one could have seen an alleged secret relationship with a minor happening. Plus, there is a chance that the Rays could be entirely off the books here. So, short of losing a superstar to alleged crimes, they could simply erase history and not spend a dollar on him.
Franco is currently on paid administrative leave.

Usually, when players go to Colorado, they see their offense production skyrocket. Well, that is not the case for the 2016 NL MVP.
Bryant became a hero in Chicago by helping the club break its 108-year World Series drought, but when he hit free agency, he opted for the Rockies. And it hasn't been great.
He played in just 42 games in his first season with the club, but hitting .306 with an .851 OPS gave fans hope. However, last year, in less than half a season, he hit .233, and his OPS dropped by nearly 200 points.
It's not outlandish to say that the MVP days are behind him, but he needs to be better.
Speaking of the Rockies, Story was on the MVP ballots three times with Colorado, becoming maybe the best power-hitting slugger in the sport (albeit benefiting from Coors Field). But since inking his deal with the Sox, he's played in just 137 games over the past two seasons.
And when he's been on the field, it hasn't been a pretty sight. He's hitting just .227 with a .685 OPS with Boston.
Sure, it was easy to predict a falloff after getting away from the thin altitude of Denver, but this has been a bit drastic. Story can opt out after the 2025 season, but why in the world would he do that right now?
Of course, he can still be a power source; he hit 16 homers in 93 games in 2022. But this does not look promising.
This contract would be higher if the Nationals didn't win the World Series in his first year of the deal. That makes some of it all worthwhile (see the Yankees' spending spree in 2009).
The good news for the lefty is he's been largely healthy with the Nats, making more than 30 starts in each full season. The bad news is he's been maybe the worst pitcher in baseball over the last three seasons.
Since 2021, among pitchers with 300-plus innings, his 5.75 ERA, 322 earned runs and 612 hits are all the worst ranks in the majors; his 1.54 WHIP trails only Brad Keller. To make matters worse, he will make $35 million this year.
But at least the nightmare is almost over: Corbin's contract expires at season's end.
Patrick Corbin
Slight caveat here: the Miami Marlins inked Stanton to a 13-year, $325 million contract in 2014, then an all-time sports record. But because they're the Marlins, they sent him to the Yankees, who took on a large majority of his contract after his 59-homer MVP season in 2017.
Stanton has shown his flair for the dramatic overall and that he still can be one of the most dangerous hitters on the planet. But it's been largely a love-hate affair with Stanton, who was booed in his first home game as a Yankee after a five-strikeout performance. He then played in just 18 games in 2019 but was a postseason hero in 2020 and carried them to the postseason in 2021. But the last two years have been eyesores.
In the last two seasons, Stanton has played in just 110 and 101 games, respectively, while hitting .202 with a .729 OPS. The Yankees have been afraid to put him in the outfield due to his injuries, and it's gotten to the point where Stanton looks like he lost half his body this spring. But he said a body transformation was needed, for obvious reasons.
So, while the hatred for Stanton by Yankees fans and fake narratives may be a bit extreme, the fact that there are four years left on this deal that's seemingly immovable is a scary sight.
At least Stanton's deal had a hot start and seemed worthwhile for at least a bit. This one, there's likely no hope.
Baez, like Bryant, was an MVP candidate with those late-2010s Cubs, and while he was always somewhat of a free-swinger, he seems to swing at pitches even Vladimir Guerrero would take (but at least Vlad would hit them if he did swing).
The Tigers signed Baez before the 2022 season, and he's hitting .230 with them, drawing just 50 walks versus 272 strikeouts. No one in the sport chases more bad pitches than him. He ranks in the third percentile of walk rate and in the 12th percentile of whiff percentage.
Baez, since his short stint with the Mets in 2021, has shown no signs of being a disciplined hitter, which has led to his numbers severely declining. The Gold-Glove caliber defense is still there, but the offense is way too glaring to be accepting of just that.

Last year, the third baseman said 162-game seasons are too long. He clearly seems to think so.
He has not played in more than 60 games as an Angel (again, the 2020 season was only 60 games), and when he's on the field, he has been pretty bad.
From 2013 to 2020, Rendon was a .290 hitter with a .862 OPS and was on the MVP ballot five times. Since 2021, however, he is slashing .235/.338/.364 with just 13 homers and 80 RBI in 148 games played.
His recent comments are helping either.
For a short time, Strasburg owned the record for the most lucrative contract ever given to a pitcher (it was broken a few days later by Gerrit Cole, which has since been broken by Yoshinobu Yamamoto earlier this offseason).
And who could blame the Nats? The 2009 No. 1 overall pick was the ace of a World Series-winning staff who just led the majors with 209.0 innings pitched. What could go wrong? Well, everything.
Strasburg underwent Tommy John surgery in 2010, and the Nationals were very careful with his recovery in the next two years, even ending his 2012 campaign early despite a postseason run.
Strasburg was healthy in 2013 and 2014, but injuries followed for the next three seasons. In 2019, though, the Nats thought he was back. Apparently, he was not.

Since signing that then-record-breaking deal, Strasburg has been mired with serious injuries, including thoracic outlet syndrome and ""severe"" nerve damage. Strasburg has made just eight starts since he signed the deal – two in 2020, five in 2021, and one in 2022.
Oh, and $80 million of his contract is deferred, meaning he'll make more than $26 million each year from 2027 to 2029. The Nats will also begin giving him a separate $10 million payment every July 1 starting in 2024 and lasting through 2030. Strasburg will finally be off the books in 2026.

Cam Newton, the top pick in the 2011 NFL Draft, offered an apology for his role in the viral shuffle that had broken out several days ago during a 7-on-7 youth football tournament.
The former NFL star quarterback explained that he had lost control of his emotions, something that he acknowledged was unacceptable.
""I’m disappointed in myself for letting it escalate to what it did and that’s what I’m apologetic to,"" Newton said on Friday during the latest edition of his ""4th and 1"" podcast. ""The truth of the matter is this: Me, being in my position, I should’ve never put myself in that position. That’s just the truth. That could’ve got ugly, for real.""

A 22-second video surfaced on Sunday showed Newton being pushed, shoved and grabbed by three people near some steps. Police officers and security eventually intervened.
""It should not have been called for. Simple. And with that, I apologize to anybody affected,"" Newton said, as he extended his apology to event organizers, players and parents.

Newton did not appear to throw any punches in the video and seemed to be fending people off.
While it remains unclear what had started the altercation, Newton did acknowledge that the trash talk during the game between him and former members of his C1N organization had carried over off the football field.
CAM NEWTON OPEN TO NFL COMEBACK IF HOMETOWN TEAM EXPRESSES INTEREST
""There was a lot of talking on both sides — on all sides, let’s just put it like that,"" Newton said. ""I don’t want to point the finger and say this person said that or that person said that. Am I saying this is the first time it happened or the last time it happened? It’s something that starts with words and should’ve ended with words.""

Newton said he’s glad the incident hadn’t taken a turn for the worse.
""There’s no excuse really,"" Newton said. ""It could have been a melee. More violence could have stemmed from that. It’s just not called for.""
Two of the men involved in the altercation, coaches TJ and Steph Brown, said that Newton's actions throughout the weekend ultimately led to the physical skirmish that started with him grabbing Steph first before TJ threw a punch.

""It just should never have gotten to that,"" TJ told Fox News Digital on Monday.
Newton, an Atlanta native, heads up the C1N football organization, which was founded in 2021 and focuses on developing young athletes’ skills in football by providing opportunities to compete at the highest level through 7-on-7 tournaments and other events.

"February 29, 2024 11:10am EST",Cristiano Ronaldo suspended for 1 match over gesture toward fans,Fox News,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Cristiano Ronaldo was punished Wednesday after he was accused of making an obscene gesture toward heckling fans after Al Nassr’s match in the Saudi Pro League earlier in the week.
The Disciplinary and Ethics Committee of the Saudi Arabia Football Federation (SAFF) suspended Ronaldo for one match. Videos posted to social media show Ronaldo making a hand motion near his groin toward fans who were chanting ""Messi"" toward him.

It came after Al Nassr defeated Al-Shabab 3-2. Ronaldo scored on a penalty in the first half.
The organization said the decision was not open to appeal. The soccer superstar will also have to pay a fine of around $5,333 (20,000 Saudi Riyals) to Al-Shabab to cover the cost of filing the complaint and half of that amount to the federation, according to The Associated Press.
Ronaldo didn’t appear to directly respond to the discipline.
""Can’t stop,"" he wrote on X with a picture of him working out.

The five-time Ballon d’Or winner is leading the league with 22 goals this season. Al Nassr is second in the standings through 21 matches. The club is four points behind Al Hilal.
Ronaldo joined Al Nassr in 2022 in one of the richest transfers in history as he moved over from Manchester United. He reportedly signed a deal worth up to $200 million annually.

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — Jake Paul put on a show before the show for several hundred at Friday night’s weigh-in.
Paul will face his most experienced opponent, Ryan Bourland, in Puerto Rico Saturday night .

Paul has made Puerto Rico home in recent years, crediting the island for his boxing success and saying he’s been able to train more diligently and lock in more easily.
But he didn’t exactly have much of a home ring advantage at Distrito T-Mobile in San Juan.
Plenty of Rhino supporters were in the crowd, some chanting ""F--- Jake Paul"" when he entered the stage.
So Paul, a master of the troll, egged them on in response. When asked by reporter Ariel Helwani about his emotions, he chanted his response.
""F--- the Rhino,"" he sang several times.

Bourland supporters responded with a ""F—- Jake Paul"" chant.
But Paul had the final word.
""I'm sick of these dumba-- rhinos walking around this motherf---ing island. Tomorrow, the rhinos are going extinct. I promise you that.""
JAKE PAUL IS ‘BASICALLY A NEVER-ENDING MACHINE’ FOR THIS REASON
At Thursday’s press conference, Paul even joked about the nickname, saying Bourland didn’t ""embody the true rhino spirit"" after Bourland said he is not vegan.
At that point, Helwani asked Bourland if he felt Paul respects him.
""It don't matter,"" Bourland replied.
Paul is coming off a fight that didn't last a single round. On Dec. 15, he knocked out Andre August and waved goodbye to him on the mat. That fight improved his professional record to 8-1.

Missouri Gov. Mike Parson reduced the prison sentence for former Kansas City Chiefs assistant coach Britt Reid, who pleaded guilty to driving while intoxicated in 2022.
The drunken driving crash left a 5-year-old girl with a traumatic brain injury.
Britt, the son of Chiefs head coach Andy Reid, will be released and serve the remainder of his three-year prison sentence on house arrest due to the commutation, the governor's office confirmed. His sentence ends Oct. 31.
He will have to adhere to multiple conditions during his house arrest. He will be required to attend weekly meetings with a parole officer and peer support sponsor. He will also have to participate in behavioral counseling, among other conditions.

A girl inside one of the cars, Ariel Young, suffered a traumatic brain injury. A total of six people, including Reid, were injured. One of the vehicles he hit had stalled because of a dead battery, and the second was owned by Ariel’s mother, who had arrived to help.

NBA All-Star Andrew Wiggins missed the Golden State Warriors game against the Washington Wizards on Tuesday, but it now appears the 25-year-old will be away from the team for an extended period of time.
Warriors head coach Steve Kerr confirmed that Wiggins will be away from the court to tend to a ""personal matter,"" and there is no timetable for his return to the team.
Kerr made it clear that the team will respect Wiggins' privacy, and said he will be given as much time as he needs.
""We do expect him to be back, but we just don't exactly know when,"" Kerr said on Bay Area radio station 95.7 The Game on Wednesday. ""We're in a position where Wiggs is a private person, and he's asked to keep it private, and we're gonna honor that. So it doesn't help for me to sit here and try to explain any of that. The bottom line is, we respect Wiggs, we need him, and we fully expect him back, but we just don't know when that will be.""

The extended absence will mark the second consecutive year Wiggins has missed a significant amount of time due to an unspecified reason. He was away from the Warriors for 25 games due to a ""family matter.""
WARRIORS, HORNETS PLAYERS SCUFFLE AFTER LAST-SECOND LAY-UP ATTEMPT IN GOLDEN STATE'S WIN
Wiggins eventually returned to the team in time for last year's postseason, appearing in 13 games. The Warriors defeated the Sacramento Kings in the opening round but were ultimately eliminated by the Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference semifinals.

At the height of the Warriors dynasty, the franchise won four NBA championships over an eight-year span. But as the team's star players aged, and injuries took a toll, the Warriors have appeared to slip out of championship contention.
Wiggins was also in the midst of a disappointing season, with the small forward averaging a career-low 12.7 points per game through his 51 appearances this year.

At one point in the season, Wiggins was removed from the starting lineup, but he bounced back and has helped the Warriors win eight of their past ten games.
The Warriors currently sit in the tenth spot in the Western Conference. If the postseason started today, the Warriors would qualify for the NBA's Play-In Tournament.

The Warriors will likely rely on Jonathan Kuminga and Brandin Podziemski during Wiggins' absence. It remains unclear whether five-time All-Star Klay Thompson will transition back into the starting lineup while Wiggins is away.

John Wall was once at the mountaintop of the NBA, but he sure has been through it over the last several years.
Since signing a max contract worth $170 million ahead of the 2017-2018 season, Wall has played just 147 games.
He's had a fair share of injuries, including heel and Achilles injuries that kept him out from Dec. 26, 2018, to New Year's Eve two years later.

In the midst of all that, Wall lost his mother and grandmother, which led to Wall reaching what he called ""rock bottom.""
Shortly after his mother died in 2019, Wall said he began taking mental health seriously and began to see a therapist, which he still does today.
But his mental state was so bad that he was one finger pull away from ending his life - on two occasions.
""If it wasn't for my two boys, I would've killed myself,"" Wall said on ""The OGs"" podcast with former NBA players Udonis Haslem and Mile Miller. ""I put a gun to my head twice, and a lot of people that's close to me and my friends at the time didn't know.""
Then he had an epiphany.

""I was like, 'Man, if I take myself away from this Earth, I'm failing my kids. Who's going to be able to raise them?' At that time, I was in a dark space trying to find happiness. So, for me, it was going out, partying, having fun, just trying to find something to get me some peace, and it wasn't the right way.""
""I still talk to a therapist to this day,"" he continued. ""So, if you ever feel like you're in a spot where you're not comfortable. … Go get help, it's OK. There's nothing wrong with it. I had to figure that out, or I wouldn't be here today.""

""This is a brand that’s trying to progressively make bigger leaps as it goes on,"" Lyles said.

However, Hardman's time in Kansas City appeared to come to an end in 2023 when he signed a deal with the New York Jets. The receiver finished his short stint with the Jets with one catch for six yards in five games before he was sent back to the Chiefs in October in exchange for a future late-round draft pick.
The former Georgia Bulldogs star had a poor showing in the Chiefs' divisional round matchup with the Buffalo Bills, fumbling twice, with one resulting in a touchback. He finished the game with one reception for two yards.

But Hardman shined one the biggest stage — Super Bowl LVIII.
In what ended up being the final play of the season, Hardman cemented his name in Super Bowl history. He caught a pass from quarterback Patrick Mahomes in overtime to seal the Chiefs' 25-22 victory over the San Francisco 49ers.

Bryce Huff’s breakout 2023 season with the New York Jets paid off in a big way for the undrafted edge rusher.
Huff is reportedly joining the Philadelphia Eagles on a three-year deal worth $51.1 million when the new league year begins on March 13, ESPN reports.
That deal makes Huff the highest-paid non-quarterback undrafted free agent in NFL history, and he’s well deserved of his payday after what transpired on a loaded Jets defensive line last season.

Huff’s deal with the Eagles is also interesting for GM Howie Roseman’s potential trades with Josh Sweat and Haasan Reddick, who have drawn interest recently. With Huff in place, it’s more likely now that one of those veteran edge rushers will be on the move this offseason.
Huff was an undrafted free agent coming out of Memphis in 2020, and the Jets helped him develop into one of the league’s most effective pass rushers last season.
SAQUON BARKLEY, EAGLES AGREE TO 3-YEAR DEAL: REPORTS
Huff totaled 10 sacks and 29 tackles in 17 games, while collecting 21 quarterback hits as well. And he wasn’t even a starter for the Jets, as he came off the sideline in clear pass-rush situations for head coach Robert Saleh’s defense.
""The memories I made in MetLife and in the city of New York will be cherished forever,"" Huff said in an X post. ""The constant words of encouragement from fans from the day I signed as an undrafted free agent to my last snap as a Jet kept me going through the good and bad times.""
He had just 312 pass rush attempts last season, and his 68 pressures recorded a league-leading 21.8% pressure percentage, per Next Gen Stats.

This production came after Huff totaled 7.5 sacks in his first three seasons. Now, after tallying a career-high 480 defensive snaps last season, Huff joins the Eagles, where he hopes to be an every-down player.
That’s what he said would factor into his free agent decision, so we’ll see if that’s what the Eagles intend for him in 2024.
Huff’s signing news came before the big splash for Roseman, as former New York Giants running back Saquon Barkley is joining the team on a three-year deal to play for his old rival.

The Minnesota Vikings legend said he hired a company, Texmax Auctions, to clear out his storage units, but then put the items up for sale ""despite clear instructions to leave any personal items untouched.""
The items being listed for auction led to rumors that Peterson was going broke, despite making over $50 million guaranteed in his career. That speculation led to Peterson clearing the air in an Instagram post.

Peterson is one of six players to rush for 2,000 yards in a single season - he was eight yards from breaking Eric Dickerson's record of 2,105 yards.
He was the seventh pick out of Oklahoma in the 2007 NFL Draft and was a four-time First-team All-Pro and seven-time Pro Bowler.

Players and coaches from each team came over to separate the players. Johnson’s brother hopped onto the court and was subsequently arrested.
Morris posted on Instagram Live in the aftermath and said the Tigers needed some leaders.
""You see what I did to South Carolina last year by myself,"" Morris said. ""My team wasn’t ready – I can say it now. I played against South Carolina last year by myself. My team was scared.

""Either way it goes, that would not have happened. You gotta have a leader on the court. We don’t have a leader on the court to be like, ‘Hey, we not about to engage. We not about to initiate. We’re not about to start no type of confrontation.’""
Morris transferred to LSU from Texas A&M for the start of the 2021-22 season. She played two seasons at LSU before she graduated. The 2022-23 season was the best of her career as she averaged 15.4 points per game, starting 34 of the 36 games she appeared in.
In an 88-64 loss to South Carolina last season, Morris scored 23 points on 11-of-29 from the field. She later helped LSU top Iowa in the national championship with 21 points in the 102-85 win.

More than 15 years after the New England Patriots were caught videotaping the New York Jets’ coaching signals from the sidelines during the 2007 season, former head coach Bill Belichick remains tight-lipped on the matter.
Belichick’s storied career with the Patriots came to an end after they agreed to mutually part ways in January after 24 seasons and six titles.

But the dynasty that was established under his leadership is in the spotlight once again because of Apple TV’s latest docuseries, which revisits the highs and lows of his tenure in New England.

The latest episode documents the 2007 controversy when the Patriots were caught filming the Jets’ signals during a Sept. 9 game. Belichick and the team were later hit with costly fines and the loss of a first-round draft pick.
The fallout from the incident engulfed the franchise for years, but more than 15 years later, Belichick seemingly has no interest in revisiting the controversy.

"February 22, 2024 4:00am EST",WWE star Randy Orton touts Cody Rhodes' rise to top of pro wrestling,Fox News,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Before Cody Rhodes was on a collision course with Roman Reigns, The Rock and the rest of The Bloodline faction, he was just trying to make a name for himself in WWE like anyone else.
The famous wrestling name of ""Rhodes"" carried as much weight as it could early in his career. He had a leg up on the competition when he entered Ohio Valley Wrestling because his father, the late great Dusty Rhodes, had trained him since he was 12. He enhanced his skills in the territory before he moved up to the main roster in 2007. Toward the end of 2008, he was in a faction with superstar Randy Orton.

Orton, whose career will be profiled in the A&E series ""Biography: WWE Legends"" on Sunday, led The Legacy with Rhodes and Ted DiBiase Jr. The two-year run in the group included a tag team championship with DiBiase, but the group would split in 2010.
Orton told Fox News Digital in a recent interview he didn’t necessarily see the possibility of Rhodes becoming the transcendent superstar he is today while the two teamed up in the late 2000s.
""I definitely saw potential, but to say I saw the potential of what he [is] now, I don’t know that if in 2007 or whenever he came on the roster, I don’t know if I looked at a young Cody Rhodes and thought he’s going to beat the s--- out of Brock Lesnar 15 years from now,"" he said. ""I don’t think I could call that one. But like last summer, he had a run of three or so matches with Brock where, I mean, he has just come so far.""
Rhodes left WWE in 2016 and hit the independent circuit hard. He appeared in Ring of Honor, TNA Wrestling, New-Japan Pro Wrestling and later helped form All Elite Wrestling.
In 2022, his time with AEW came to an end. He stunned the crowd at WrestleMania 38 when he challenged Seth Rollins and beat him. Aside from a torn pectoral injury, Rhodes was catapulted into superstardom.

WWE STAR RANDY ORTON SAYS HE WASN'T READY TO BE YOUNGEST CHAMPION AT 24, TALKS DOCUSERIES EPISODE
""And what he did for the business when he left and what he did for us talent in offering a competition, and I don’t know if I call it competition now, but for a hot second there, Cody was buzzing because he got these guys together, got a ragtag group of guys together and got a TV deal and was drawing eyes from all over the world with this product,"" Orton said. ""And the fact that he came back to us, I think, kind of shows you where the obvious No. 1 place to be is if you’re a pro wrestler.""
Rhodes is now due to headline WrestleMania 40 in Philadelphia and potentially finish his story and win the WWE Undisputed Universal Championship.
WWE teased for a few weeks that, after winning the Royal Rumble for the second straight time, Rhodes would challenge Rollins for the World Heavyweight Championship. The Rock even came back to try to insert himself into the WrestleMania main event against Rhodes. The WWE Universe, instead, clamored for Rhodes to finish the story.
Orton said that support underscored just how popular and important Rhodes is in the company and in the industry.
""I love that he’s come back home. I love that he’s a part of the locker room,"" he said. ""I love when I see him talking to other young talent and the role that he’s in now as, like, a top guy. And if not just a top guy, possibly in a short amount of time, the top guy.""

""I mean, think about it like this: There’s a lot of fans out there that would rather see Cody finish his story than to see arguably the biggest superstar in the world right now compete at WrestleMania. They prefer seeing Cody, and that is huge. There’s no one else on the roster that could take that position from Cody, not even The Rock.""

The mother of the girl who was seriously injured in a 2021 drunk driving crash caused by former Kansas City Chiefs assistant coach Britt Reid spoke out after Missouri Gov. Mike Parson commuted the sentence of the ex-NFL coach.
Felicia Miller told ESPN in an interview published Monday that if the roles were reversed, her life ""would’ve been over."" She added that she was ""p----d"" when she learned of Reid’s fate earlier this month.
She said she believed had she been responsible for the wreck that injured Reid’s child, the outcome would have been different.

""Look who we're talking about. We're talking about Britt Reid. He was the assistant coach of the Kansas City Chiefs, and we're in Kansas City,"" she told ESPN. ""If it was just me, just somebody driving down the road — especially if I was drunk and slammed into his car and he had his child in the car and his child was injured, it would’ve been over for me.

Ariel Young suffered a traumatic brain injury on Feb. 4, 2021 when prosecutors said Reid, the son of head coach Andy Reid, was intoxicated while driving nearly 20 mph over the speed limit when he crashed his truck into two cars on an entrance ramp to Interstate 435 near Arrowhead Stadium.
Police said the former coach had a blood-alcohol level of 0.113% two hours after the crash. Ariel was in a coma for 11 days and spent several months in the hospital.

""We went to court. We [were] told, 'You're going to get justice,'"" Miller told ESPN. ""He's put away for a year and about three months. So we didn't get [any] justice. It's not enough.""
The family’s attorney, Tom Porto, told the outlet that he believed that the governor reached his decision ""because he’s a Chiefs fan.""
""And when I say fan, I’m not talking about somebody that casually watches them on TV. He’s a guy that’s a season ticket holder. He goes to games, he went to the Super Bowl, he went to the Super Bowl after parties, he went to the Super Bowl parade, the rally — all of the stuff.""

Parson responded to the criticism following his decision to reduce Reid’s jail time in a statement last week, when he expressed ""his deepest sympathy for any additional heartache this commutation has caused the Young Family, as that was certainly not his intention.""

A defamation lawsuit against Dallas Cowboys team owner Jerry Jones was dismissed on Wednesday.
Alexandra Davis, the woman who claimed to be Jones’ biological daughter, alleged that Jones and two of his associates concocted a plan to label her an ""extortionist.""

The federal judge determined that Davis didn’t sufficiently prove that Jones and his associates acted with malice, according to FOX 4.
The ruling came days after a judge upheld a separate ruling that Jones must take a paternity test to determine whether he is the biological father of Davis.
Jones’ lawyers argued in the hearing that the man who was married to Cynthia Davis at the time was the presumed father of the woman, according to the Dallas Morning News.
Jones has denied being the father of Davis.

RAIDERS RELEASE JIMMY GAROPPOLO AFTER FIRST SEASON OF 3-YEAR DEAL, PED SUSPENSION
Davis filed her initial lawsuit against Jones on March 3, 2022. She alleged that her mother, Cynthia Davis, had a relationship with Jones in the late '90s in which they conceived her. Davis sought a DNA test to prove that Jones was her father after initially suing, and later dropped it, to have a judge declare she wasn’t bound by a financial settlement between him and her mother, according to the paper.
Davis refiled the defamation lawsuit in November. She was able to refile the complaint based on statements made in a March 2022 ESPN story, ABC News reported last year.
The complaint said Jones’ attorney, Donald P. Jack, and Jim Wilkinson, a communications consultant for the Jones family, falsely accused Davis of ""being an extortionist and portrayed Plaintiff as attempting to 'shakedown' Defendant Jones.""

The Seattle Seahawks' trade to acquire Jamal Adams didn't work out like they had hoped.
After a drama-filled stint with the New York Jets, one of the best young stars in the game was surprisingly traded.
The Jets acquired two first-round picks from the Seahawks for a player who did not want to be with the team and was vocal about his displeasure.

Adams played just 34 of a possible 67 games with Seattle, and now he is a free agent.
The Seahawks reportedly released Adams Tuesday, ending his four-year tenure with them.
Seattle inked Adams to a four-year deal worth north of $70 million in 2021, making him the highest-paid safety in NFL history at the time. But with two years left on that deal, Adams is worth a $20.8 million cap hit.
The Seahawks had to be ecstatic with the trade in Adams' first season with them. Despite playing only a dozen games, Adams was a second-team All-Pro and a Pro Bowler for the third straight season. Best known for his blitzing ability rather than his skills in coverage, that 2020 season was also the last time he had a sack.

In the last three seasons, he's played just 22 games.
He was also fined $50,000 last season for a tiff with a neurotrauma consultant who examined him for a concussion.
Later in the season, he was criticized for zooming in on a photo of a Jets reporter's wife, captioning it ""Yikes."" The reporter used that same caption when Adams allowed a touchdown to the Dallas Cowboys.
The Jets used one of the picks it received for Adams to trade up in 2021 to take offensive lineman Alijah Vera-Tucker. In 2022, they used Seattle's first-rounder (10th overall) to take Garrett Wilson, who became that season's Offensive Rookie of the Year.

College athletes and the possibility of their status going from amateurs to employees of their schools did not appear to sit well with Clemson head football coach Dabo Swinney.
Last month, a federal judge barred the NCAA from enforcing rules that prohibit NIL compensation from being used to recruit athletes. The judge wrote that the NCAA’s prohibition likely violates federal antitrust law and harms athletes.

The first step toward college athletes being employees was launched before the ruling, as a National Labor Relations Board regional official ruled that Dartmouth men’s basketball players are employees, potentially clearing the way for an election that would create the first labor union for student-athletes.
Swinney disagreed with the model.
""The best thing for coaches in the kind of world we're in right now is for (athletes) to be employees,"" Swinney said last week, via the Post and Courier. ""The worst thing for (the athletes) is to be employees. That's not a world we want for 18-year-olds. … I think we lost our way.""
Swinney said he would rather see an emphasis on education while athletes get paid instead of having one or the other.

""(I) think the NIL is awesome,"" he said, via Clemson Insider. ""I really am (for it). I am all for enhancing the scholarship however you want, but I also understand the reality that ninety-eight percent of these kids are not going to play in the NFL.
""We need to educate our young people in this society. Nobody talks about the value of an education anymore.""
Swinney floated the idea of creating a 401(k) for athletes, and if they take money out early, they would face a penalty.

Lauded as the worldwide leader’s original NFL insider, Mortensen spent almost all of his journalism career at ESPN, joining their ranks in 1991 when he reported for ""NFL GameDay,"" which eventually became today’s ""Sunday NFL Countdown."" He was also featured on ""Outside The Lines"" and served as an analyst for the NFL Draft.
Mortensen’s journalism career began at the Daily Breeze in Torrance, California, his hometown. He eventually moved on to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, where he covered multiple sports with MLB’s Atlanta Braves (1983-1985) as well as the NFL’s Atlanta Falcons (1985-1986). He eventually covered the NFL as a whole, starting in 1987, where he earned the George Polk Award for his work.
Mortensen then joined The National, where he covered the league for two years before making the leap to ESPN.
The veteran reporter was infamously known to be the one who broke the news of the New England Patriots’ ""Deflategate"" controversy, initially reporting that 11 of the 12 footballs used during the team’s AFC Championship Game matchup in 2015 against the Indianapolis Colts were under 2 pounds per square inch, which is the NFL’s regulation.

The Wells Report would later find that only one of the 22 readings made in the investigation of the Patriots found the Patriots’ footballs to be under 2 pounds per square inch. Mortensen’s report was debunked, yet ESPN left it up without any retraction or clarification.
Mortensen deleted his post on Twitter months later, though he continued to stand by his report.
Mortensen’s loss shocked many in the NFL world, including his colleague at ESPN, Mike Greenberg.
""Chris Mortensen was one of the kindest, most generous gentlemen you could ever come across, in any field,"" Greenberg tweeted. ""His professionalism and decency earned him universal admiration – his enthusiasm and good nature made him everyone’s friend. His mark on the business will last a long time, his impact on those of us lucky enough to know him well will last the rest of our lives. Rest in peace, Mort. We will treasure your memory forever.""
Fellow ESPN colleague Mike Tannenbaum also shared his condolences.

""I’m absolutely devastated to hear about the passing of Chris Mortensen,"" he posted on X. ""While he was a titan and a pioneer in our profession, he was also the kindest and most generous person to me. He was a mentor to some many of us at ESPN. He will be missed, but his legacy of kindness and giving will remain with us. Rest in peace my friend.""

Iowa Hawkeyes star Caitlin Clark on Thursday announced she will enter the 2024 WNBA Draft when her collegiate basketball career comes to an end.
Clark is one of the most prolific women’s basketball players of all time. She recently set the all-time scoring mark in NCAA Division 1 women’s basketball and is eyeing Pete Maravich’s record as the all-time leading NCAA Division I scorer. She set the major women’s collegiate scoring record on Wednesday night against Minnesota.

She now has 3,650 career points with one more game in the regular season left to go, along with the Big Ten Tournament and the NCAA Women’s Basketball Tournament.
While Clark maintained she still has business to take care of, she said she was ""excited"" to be entering the draft.
""It is impossible to fully express my gratitude to everyone who has supported me during my time at Iowa — my teammates, who made the last four years the best; my coaches, trainers and staff who always let me be me; Hawkeye fans who filled Carver every night; and everyone who came out to support us across the country, especially the young kids,"" Clark said in a statement.

""Most importantly, none of this would have been possible without my family and friends who have been by my side through it all. Because of all of you, my dreams came true.""
Iowa was on the cusp of winning a national championship last season but ran into LSU.
It was up in the air whether Clark would immediately turn pro or opt-in for an extra year of eligibility due to the 2020 coronavirus and the potential to earn a great deal of money through name, image and likeness.
But she squashed any notion of that with her announcement.

Entering the NFL Scouting Combine, everyone knew Xavier Worthy was the fastest receiver in this draft class.
The only question was whether he would make history?
The Texas Longhorn did exactly that when he ran a 4.21-second 40-yard dash, the fastest ever recorded at the combine.
Worthy surpassed John Ross of Washington, the ninth selection of the 2017 NFL Draft, by just one-hundredth of a second.

Ross parlayed his record-breaking performance into a top-10 selection later that year, although he never panned out in the league.
Worthy has studied one player in particular.
And it makes sense that the player was a dynamic speedster with a flair for the dramatic.
""I modeled my game after DeSean Jackson,"" Worthy told FanDuel TV's ""Up & Adams."" ""He's my go-to. Whenever I need to look at film or anything, I'll look at him.
SEAHAWKS CUT JAMAL ADAMS LESS THAN 3 YEARS AFTER MAKING HIM HIGHEST-PAID SAFETY IN NFL HISTORY
""Just how smart he is. He's a really smart football player. I feel like people don't give him credit for that. Just him understanding leverage and just what he does with the ball in his hands. I feel like I kinda took that into my game. Put the ball in my hands, I feel like I'm dangerous from anywhere on the field.""
DeSean Jackson of the Los Angeles Rams warms up prior to a game against the Detroit Lions at SoFi Stadium Oct. 24, 2021, in Inglewood, Calif. (Katelyn Mulcahy/Getty Images)
Jackson was known for his big-play potential. He had at least one 50-yard reception in all but one of his 15 seasons, had at least a 70-yard catch in nine of them and led the NFL in yards per reception four times.
His best play might have been the Miracle at the Meadowlands II in 2010, when he returned a punt for a touchdown as time expired against the New York Giants shortly after muffing it, completing a comeback from down three touchdowns in the fourth quarter.
While it remains to be seen if Worthy can live up to his football role model, he seems to be on a decent path.
In his third and final season at Texas, Worthy posted career highs with 75 receptions for 1,014 yards. In his career, he had 197 catches for 2,755 yards and 26 touchdowns.

His Longhorns won the Big 12 last season, earning them a trip to the College Football Playoff.
Worthy was named to the Big 12 first team last season, his second such nod. He also made the first team in 2021 and the second team in 2022.

Joe Mixon won’t be testing the free agent waters after all.
The Houston Texans reportedly reached a trade with the Cincinnati Bengals for Mixon in exchange for an undisclosed pick, according to multiple reports.
The trade comes after the Bengals made their intentions known that Mixon would be released after agreeing to terms on a deal with veteran running back Zack Moss on Monday.

But, before Mixon could hit the open market, the Texans scooped him up as they were in need of a running back themselves. Running back Devin Singletary, who became a free agent after spending the 2023 season with the Texans, agreed to a three-year pact with the New York Giants on Monday as well.
Texans GM Nick Caserio has been filling many roster holes already with the legal tampering period starting on Monday, and it was always expected he could make a splash at the running back position.
TEXANS CONTINUE TO BOLSTER ROSTER WITH DANIELLE HUNTER AGREEING TO 2-YEAR DEAL: REPORTS
Instead of going after Derrick Henry or Saquon Barkley (though it was reported he offered the latter), Caserio worked out a trade here for a player not expected to be available this offseason.

Mixon has been called out for his explosiveness with the Bengals, but he produced when needed. He did so in 2023 with 1,034 rushing yards and nine touchdowns on the ground, while hauling in 52 receptions for 376 yards and three touchdowns through the air.
Mixon has totaled over 1,200 scrimmage yards the past three seasons, including his lone Pro Bowl year with 1,519 total yards (1,205 rushing) and 16 touchdowns.
The Texans add another every-down back that can provide a solid rushing attack after ranking 28th in yards per game on the ground last season.

But should the impossible happen, Rodgers could be looking at a steep pay cut come Inauguration Day 2025.
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is running an independent campaign for president, is ""considering"" the four-time NFL MVP as his potential vice presidential running mate, a campaign rep confirmed to Fox News Digital on Tuesday. The New York Times, which first reported the notion, also said Jesse Ventura is on the short list as well.
Rodgers has been an avid supporter of Kennedy over the last year. He appeared to endorse Kennedy’s run for president last April. Should a Kennedy-Rodgers ticket somehow upset the presumptive candidates from the two major parties, President Biden and former President Trump, it would mean less money than Rodgers would receive playing football.

Vice President Harris made about $219,000 as vice president in 2022. She and second gentleman Doug Emhoff reported a combined $456,918 in income when they released their tax returns in April 2023.
For Rodgers, the number would be lower than the $915,000 veteran minimum set for the 2024 season.
Kennedy has not made an official decision on his running mate, and Rodgers hasn’t commented on the potential of joining him on the campaign trail.
Kennedy’s campaign said this month that he has enough signatures to get on the ballot in Nevada. In January, he met the requirement to appear on the Utah ballot. The campaign has also said he’s in line to appear on the ballots in Hawaii and New Hampshire as well.

As the 2024 Major League Soccer season kicks off on Wednesday night, all eyes are looking at Lionel Messi and his first full season with Inter Miami.
Messi will take on Real Salt Lake on the road to begin the year, and though the general consensus believe Messi is good for the MLS, there is one who isn’t a big fan.
Don Garber, the league’s commissioner, thinks the attention on Messi is too much, especially from the media.

""It’s easy and somewhat lazy for reporters to just write about Messi — it’s like writing about Taylor Swift,"" he told Sports Business Journal. ""There’s so much more here that I think people need to recognize.""
Garber’s comments come at a time when intense focus is on the MLS, especially considering their deal with Apple, a 10-year, $2.5 billion partnership that has MLS Season Pass on Apple TV.
EX-BARCELONA SOCCER STAR DANI ALVES' SEXUAL ASSAULT TRIAL BEGINS
One of the main reasons for Apple’s investment is the arrival of Messi and his other famous teammates, including Luis Suarez, Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba.
They are expected to be one of the best teams in MLS this season after winning the 2023 Leagues Cup on Aug. 19 last year.

But it’s also not wrong to see a league commissioner wanting widespread coverage of the other great players and teams around the league.
Garber’s comparison of Messi to Swift, however, is an interesting one. He’s obviously referencing how the NFL was covered this past season with Swift dating Kansas City Chiefs star tight end Travis Kelce on their path to another Super Bowl victory.
Sure, like Swift, Messi is one of the most recognizable faces across the globe, and anything involving him will make a headline.

A Texas judge on Wednesday upheld a ruling ordering Dallas Cowboys team owner Jerry Jones to take a paternity test to determine whether he’s the biological father of a 27-year-old woman.
Dallas County Judge Sandra Jackson made the initial ruling on Feb. 19. Attorneys for Jones and Alexandra Davis, the woman suing the NFL executive, made their cases, according to the Dallas Morning News.
Attorney Kris Hayes touted the ruling in an interview with the paper.

""Alex is in a position where she really no longer has to hide her truth or live under the thumb of fear and maybe she’s going to finally get some peace and we hope other families will have that same benefit from the judge following the law,"" Hayes said.
Jones’ lawyers argued in the hearing that the man who was married to Cynthia Davis at the time was the presumed father of the woman, according to the Dallas Morning News.
Jones has denied being the father of Davis.
Davis filed her initial lawsuit against Jones on March 3, 2022. She alleged that her mother, Cynthia Davis, had a relationship with Jones in the late '90s in which they conceived her. Davis sought a DNA test to prove that Jones was her father after initially suing, and later dropping it, to have a judge declare she wasn’t bound by a financial settlement between him and her mother, according to the paper.

Jack, and Jim Wilkinson, a communications consultant for the Jones family, falsely accused Davis of ""being an extortionist and portrayed Plaintiff as attempting to 'shakedown' Defendant Jones.""

The Denver Nuggets have decided not to make the trip to the White House, a standard for defending champions.
The 2022-23 NBA title winners were originally slated to visit President Biden in January, but he needed to reschedule to March 18.
Now, just over a week until the date, the Nuggets have canceled due to scheduling conflicts of their own.

The Nuggets face the Minnesota Timberwolves on March 19 in Minnesota. Denver, Minnesota and the Oklahoma City Thunder are all within one game of each other for the top seed in the Western Conference.
TNT NBA insider Chris Haynes reported that Denver is skipping the White House trip because they are ""prioritizing that No. 1 seed.""
""They’re really trying to do all that they can to get into that spot heading into the playoffs,"" Haynes said on Thursday night.
""It was clearly a basketball decision. . . . The Nuggets wanted to do it, but the schedules just didn't work out.""
However, Hall of Famer Charles Barkley said the Nuggets are making a mistake.
""Are they flying Southwest or something? Come on, man. I actually have a problem with this whole thing that’s happened in sports the last few years, not just now,"" Barkley said on Thursday, hinting that teams skipped visits with former President Donald Trump.

The last championship team to visit Trump in office were the 2019 Washington Nationals, five days after their World Series victory over the Houston Astros. The pandemic made visits tougher, and by the time restrictions started to be lifted, Biden had taken office.
The UConn men's and LSU women's teams visited Biden last year. The President was criticized for originally not inviting the University of Georgia football team last year. After they got an invitation, the Bulldogs did not go. They did not make the trip the year prior, either, due to COVID-19 safety precautions.

""I wanted to have different walks of life in my book,"" Laflin said. ""These are all women who inspired me.""
Laflin told Fox that at the start of her career, some women in sports weren’t as empowering as they are today. Despite this, it’s key for her to invoke inspiration in women of all ages anywhere in their careers.
""It’s really important for me to put a hand out to help where I can,"" she said. Laflin also founded the nonprofit organization ""Hounds and Heroes.""
Laflin kick-started her career in scouting as a pregame and postgame sports reporter for the Los Angeles Lakers before becoming an unpaid intern for the team. And while various unbroken female sports figures have inspired her to continue building her empire, she also credits the men who rally behind her, too.
""I wasn’t comfortable in my own skin,"" Laflin said of herself as a first-year NBA scout. She revealed that she concealed her hair in a ball cap and sported baggy sweatpants to fit what she thought was the part.
""I was trying to be one of the boys,"" she said. It was Brian Shaw, now assistant coach for the Los Angeles Clippers, who encouraged Laflin to find her place in the industry.

""He told me, ‘You’ve got to be comfortable in your own skin,’"" she said. Laflin went on to sign as a scout for the Lakers for 13 years, five of which produced championship rings.
""And Kobe, too,"" she said of NBA legend, Kobe Bryant. She described Bryant as a mentor, friend and confidant who took pride in empowering women in the industry.
""Kobe would see me crying,"" she said of the times she’d read comments about herself in the media. ""He’d say ‘This is good. You want to have naysayers. You want to have doubters.’""
All of that, work ethic and more, was what struck Laflin to write a book. After three years of talking with publishers, she wrote, not just any book, but a book she would be proud of.
""They said, ‘I want you to do a tell-all book about your days with the Lakers, days with the Dallas Cowboys,’"" she said. While Laflin understood publishers sought out a deep dive into the secrets of athlete’s lives, that wasn’t where her head or heart were at: ""I wanted to write a book that was inspiring for women.""

Laflin hopes this book is used by journalism schools and individuals to show women how capable and resilient they are, as long as they immerse themselves in their own goals.
""This book is one of the things I’m most proud of,"" she said. ""My ‘why’ is to show women that there is a space for them.""
As for her advice for other women looking to break into the sports industry, she’s radiating guidance.
""Take any job you can to just get in the door,"" she said. She recommends a job, an internship or even a place in ticket sales to prove your commitment. She emphasizes the need for determination, drive for success and lack of forsaking: ""As we know, you’re not just handed things. You have to work hard for things. You have to prove yourself, be versatile.""
""Yes, I’m on air, but I can write, produce, shoot, too,"" she concluded.

The drama between Super Bowl hero Mecole Hardmon and his former team continues to unfold with the Kansas City Chiefs wideout vehemently denying allegations that he leaked the New York Jets’ game plans during his brief tenure with the team last season.
Hardman, coming off his third Super Bowl victory with the Chiefs, took to social media on Friday to dismiss allegations that he was responsible for leaking game plans when he played with the Jets earlier this season.

""There were FALSE accusations made about me and MY CHARACTER! To set the record straight, I have never and would never leak gameplans to another team,"" he wrote in a post on X.

""I have never been a person to give an opponent an upper hand. I always want to win no matter the circumstances!!!!!""
The allegations stem from a since-deleted post made by Jets’ cornerback Sauce Gardner, who responded to criticisms Hardman made of the team during a podcast earlier this week.
""We ain’t gon talk about how our offensive gameplan got leaked vs. the Eagles tho,"" Gardner reportedly said in the message, according to the New York Post.

Hardman, who began the 2023 season with the Jets before getting traded back to the Chiefs after just six games, did not hold back on detailing his experience in New York during ""The Pivot"" podcast on Tuesday.
""It’s the lies and the way they handled me. I didn’t like it at all,"" he said.
Hardman also called out the Jets’ offense, saying the team had no plan after quarterback Aaron Rodgers went down with a season-ending injury.

""It was over with. I had already talked to [Chiefs General Manager Brett] Veach and [quarterback Patrick Mahomes] like, ‘Come get me,'"" he continued, adding that he had been ""checked out"" early on.

This season, Hardman returned to the Chiefs, for whom he would score the game-winning touchdown in overtime to defeat the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl LVIII.

The Kansas City Chiefs may be the back-to-back champions, but there's still apparently lots of fixing to do.
The Chiefs officially made their mark as a dynasty, becoming the first team to repeat as Super Bowl champions since 2005, and winning their third title in five years earlier this month.
However, despite their crazy run, Clark Hunt received an F-minus rating from players in the league, the worst in the NFL.

""The players are frustrated by their workplace offerings, especially after the team's sustained success in recent years,"" the NFLPA said in their survey findings.
Players' main concern is Hunt's inability to renovate their ""overdue"" facilities, especially their locker room. The survey says Hunt apparently told players that renovations would be made last year, but they never came.
""Though the players received actual chairs with backs to sit in at their lockers in response to last year’s feedback, it did not change the fact that the locker room is overdue for a renovation. What adds to the frustration is that management told the players that renovations would come after the 2022 season. The players went on to win the Super Bowl and when they arrived back at their facility for the 2023-2024 season, they realized the team never followed through with the promised renovation (other than adding chairs).""

SUPER BOWL HERO MECOLE HARDMAN SAYS HE TOLD CHIEFS TO 'COME GET ME' FROM JETS
The team also received Fs in nutrition and training staff, ranking 31st and 32nd, respectively. Players feel that they don't get enough one-on-one treatment, and the staff isn't ""willing to provide support/treatment to all players.""
""From the results, it is clear that there has not been a significant reinvestment back into the facilities even after consistent success,"" the report states. ""That has led to a high level of frustration among player respondents and reflects in club owner Clark Hunt’s ranking as the least willing to invest in team facilities among all NFL owners/ownership group in the opinions of the respondents.""
The Chiefs did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding the study.

On the contrary, Andy Reid was ranked the best head coach in the league by the players.
Nobody had repeated since the New England Patriots in the 2003 and 2004 seasons.
The Chiefs have not shied away from their desire to become the first team to three-peat, a feat no one has accomplished in the four major sports since the Los Angeles Lakers from 2000 to 2002.

Mike Evans decided against testing the free agent market. The Tampa Bay Buccanears star wide receiver agreed to a two-year contract extension earlier this week.
Evans confirmed the deal by posting a photo of himself in a Buccaneers' jersey along with a photo of Leonardo DiCaprio from ""The Wolf of Wall Street.""
Now that Evans has cemented his standing with the Bucs for the next couple of years, he hopes to have the opportunity to catch passes from the same quarterback in 2024.
Evans spoke highly of quarterback Baker Mayfield and said he was hopeful he would share a locker room with the signal-caller next season.

Evans also spoke about how Tampa Bay and Buccaneers players embraced Mayfield last season.

Evans believes the Bucs offer the ideal situation for Mayfield next season.

The Boston Red Sox got bad injury news with one of their free agent acquisitions on Tuesday.
Veteran starter Lucas Giolito had imaging done on his elbow, and initial tests show he has a partially torn ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) and a flexor strain that could require surgery, per ESPN.
If surgery is the call for Giolito, the Red Sox’s expected Opening Day starter, he could sit out the entire 2024 season.

Giolito signed a two-year pact with the Red Sox worth $38.5 million, which made up for most of Boston’s conservative approach in free agency despite saying otherwise at the onset.
The Sox also signed reliever Liam Hendriks, who is expected to miss most of the season after undergoing Tommy John surgery. There’s a chance he misses the entire season as well. Boston also brought in right-hander Cooper Criswell, while trading for outfielder Tyler O’Neil.
WIDOW OF TIM WAKEFIELD DIES LESS THAN 5 MONTHS AFTER FORMER PITCHER'S PASSING
After trading Chris Sale to the Atlanta Braves, the Sox knew they needed another veteran starter that could be at the top of their rotation. Giolito was the man to replace him, and after putting together at least 160 innings in the past three seasons, it was a good signing.
However, Red Sox fans wanted to see more out of the organization, especially in the pitching department with the likes of Blake Snell and Jordan Montgomery still on the free agent market.
Could Boston be more aggressive for a starter now that Giolito should be missing substantial time?

If surgery is chosen, it isn’t the first time Giolito had to undergo Tommy John. He did so in 2012, two months after the Washington Nationals took him out of Harvard-Westlake High School in Los Angeles 16th overall.
As of now, reports say the tests are unclear about what the next step is, and more importantly, what type of surgery Giolito needs. The internal brace procedure has been the better of the two surgeries in recent years, as it provides the athlete a shorter recovery.
But a UCL tear, slight or not, paired with flexor strains make Giolito’s situation grim for 2024.
As of now, the Red Sox’s rotation looks like this: Brayan Bello, Nick Pivetta, Kutter Crawford, Garrett Whitlock and Tanner Houck.
Other than Snell and Montgomery, the likes of Mike Clevinger, Michael Lorenzen, Zack Greinke and others are on the free agent market.
Last season, Giolito pitched to a 4.88 ERA over 33 starts between three teams, most of which came with the Chicago White Sox. He also started six games for the Los Angeles Angels and six for the Cleveland Guardians, where he struggled mightily.

Ed Kelce appears to be fully behind his son’s relationship with the pop star. The two have celebrated the Chiefs triumphs together during the 2023 season.
Frankel previously criticized Swift in September for ""chumming with"" Donna Kelce in the suite of one of the Chiefs games.
""It felt like the Chia Pet of a relationship,"" she said in September, according to Page Six. ""Like, just add water. Like, they were together for 10 years. Like, she’s a full football wife. … She literally looked like she had been in a serious relationship with this guy for decades.""

Many players use spring training to not just get in baseball shape again, but more importantly, work out the kinks before the numbers start to matter on the scoreboard.
Well, the Detroit Tigers are hoping what transpired on Sunday afternoon against the Tampa Bay Rays is completely out of their system and never happens again.
Nobody wants a routine fly ball to result in an inside-the-park home run, but that was exactly what happened – at least in the box score.

Even the official scorer needs some work before the regular season.
Rays outfielder Kameron Misner, a career minor leaguer in all but 30 games, was at the dish when he popped a ball sky-high to the shallow part of center field. Four Tigers defenders were converging on the ball.
However, shortstop Andrew Navigato looked around at his teammates and noticed no one was standing under the ball. So, he tried sprinting to make a diving play to save the out, but it only got worse from there.

Not only did Navigato miss the ball, but after hitting the grass, his foot kicked the ball away from everyone toward right field.
Meanwhile, Misner had been running well around the bases, and by the time the ball was picked up in the outfield, he was about to round third base. The Tigers tried getting the ball home to save face, but Misner was already in to score.

The official scorer ruled this an inside-the-park home run, but it was clear to see that the kick should be considered an error. With Misner already at second base when the ball landed in the outfield, it likely should have been ruled a double and a score on an error by Navigato.
""A fielder is given an error if, in the judgment of the official scorer, he fails to convert an out on a play that an average fielder should have made,"" the MLB rule book states on what constitutes an error in the field. ""Fielders can also be given errors if they make a poor play that allows one or more runners to advance on the bases.""
Many times have fly balls that should have been caught went untouched for a hit in the books, but that last part in the rules is what happened with Navigato.
Alas, this is what spring training is for, making sure decisions both on the field, and off it, are buttoned up by the time games start to count.
For this game, the home run was a part of a Rays rally, as they were down 9-3 but ended up tying the game 9-9, which eventually became the final score.

Seavey ""was forced to dispatch a moose in self defense after the moose became entangled with the dogs and the musher on the trail,"" officials said in a statement. ""Seavey and his team were 14 miles outside of the Skwentna checkpoint on their way to the Finger Lake checkpoint.
""Seavey continued on the trail, stopped to rest and feed his dogs and pulled into the Finger Lake checkpoint at 8:00 a.m. AKST. The Alaska State Troopers were immediately notified by Race Marshal Warren Palfrey. Seavey dropped one dog at the Finger Lake checkpoint who was injured during the moose encounter. The dog was immediately flown from Finger Lake to Anchorage and is currently being evaluated by veterinarians in Anchorage.""

Dallas Cowboys team owner Jerry Jones told reporters at the Senior Bowl earlier this year the team was ""all-in"" this offseason, which piqued fans’ interest in what the team was going to do in free agency.
Jones later clarified during the NFL Scouting Combine that the definition of ""all-in"" may be different in his vocabulary than others. He explained it was all about thinking and coaching differently when it came to their players, free agency and the draft itself, according to ESPN.

Over the last couple of days, Cowboys fans saw Chris Jones re-sign with the Kansas City Chiefs, Saquon Barkley reportedly agree to a deal with the Philadelphia Eagles and a whole host of other top talent make deals and end their free agency early.
Instead, Dallas fans saw running back Tony Pollard agree to a deal with the Tennessee Titans and defensive end Dorance Armstrong and center Tyler Biadasz leave for the Washington Commanders, according to multiple reports. Cowboys fans did not appear to be too happy.
""I do not like the sound of this and it damn sure feel like it won’t be a winning season unless they get some proven vets in the building,"" Bryant wrote in response to a report the Cowboys were unlikely to pursue Derrick Henry, Austin Ekeler or other top running backs.

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico – For the first time in nearly three-and-a-half years, Jake Paul will not be the main event on a boxing card.
Paul, who has become one of the faces of the sport, as well as a successful promoter, has maybe his toughest bout yet with Ryan Bourland on Saturday. Bourland is the most experienced fighter Paul has faced, with 19 professional fights under his belt (he has won 17 of them).
However, in perhaps a rare move for Paul, who boasts dozens of millions of social media followers, he is taking a backseat on his own card in order to give a female boxing legend a proper homecoming.

Amanda Serrano, who inked a deal with Paul's Most Valuable Promotions in 2021, the year it was founded, will be fighting her 50th professional match this Saturday in her native Puerto Rico at the island's famed Coliseo, and a sellout of the 18,500 person arena is expected.
Since his boxing career, Paul has actually made the island home to get away from the constant media and focus on training. However, despite his celebrity status, and fighting in his new home, making the Puerto Rican native the main event ""wasn't even a question.""
""I just always wanted that for her. This is her moment, and her time to shine,"" Paul said to Fox News Digital before Saturday's fight. ""It’s just so cool to support her. She really deserves this moment and has worked so hard for it. I’m happy to be a fan. The pressure is off of you when you’re not the main event, but you hear the crowd is much louder for her out there. So that’s why this is her spot, her time to shine.""

RENOWNED FIGHTER AMANDA SERRANO SAYS TEAMING WITH JAKE PAUL IS 'THE BEST DECISION I'VE MADE IN BOXING'
Serrano headlined at Madison Square Garden against Katie Taylor in 2022. It was the first women's boxing match to headline the world's most famous arena. However, her fight Saturday against Nina Meinke will probably stand out above the rest.
""Super excited. Want it to be over with already,"" Serrano said at Thursday's press conference in San Juan. ""It's been a long buildup, a long camp, trained really hard. I'm mentally and physically ready to put on a great show in the Coliseo, the sold out crowd with a tough, durable opponent.""
For Serrano, there is some added juice, being a female headliner in a male-dominant sport.
""We're gonna go out there and show that women can fight. We can sell, obviously.""
Paul added, ""This is such an important fight for boxing… I feel like it's going to be one of the loudest events in boxing history.""

Aaron Rodgers, the New York Jets quarterback who independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is considering as a running mate, is accused of sharing Sandy Hook shooting conspiracy theories.
A CNN report about Rodgers originated from an alleged conversation more than 10 years ago between reporter Pamela Brown and Rodgers, who played for the Green Bay Packers at the time, at a post-Kentucky Derby party in 2013.
Brown, who co-wrote the piece with Jake Tapper, was introduced to Rodgers, and the quarterback allegedly brought up the school shooting and claimed it was a ""government inside job, and the media was ignoring it,"" according to the report.

Another source told CNN Rodgers had said ""Sandy Hook never happened. … All those children never existed. They were all actors."" The source also claimed Rodgers believed grieving parents were ""actors."" The source said the conversation occurred ""several years ago.""
A representative for Rodgers didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital. A rep declined to comment to CNN.

Dallas Cowboys star Dak Prescott on Monday filed a lawsuit against a woman who accused him of sexual assault and demanded money to stay quiet about the allegation.
Prescott said in the lawsuit that lawyers for the female accuser sent a letter to him in January demanding $100 million to stay quiet about the accusations, FOX 4 reported, citing court documents. The woman claimed Prescott sexually assaulted her in 2017 after his first season in Dallas.

""Mr. Prescott — a new father to a baby girl — has great empathy for survivors of sexual assault,"" Prescott’s attorney Levi McCathern said in a statement, via ESPN. ""He fervently believes that all perpetrators of such crimes should be punished to the fullest extent of the law.
""To be clear, Mr. Prescott has never engaged in any nonconsensual, sexual conduct with anyone. Lies hurt. Especially, malicious lies. We will not allow the defendant and her legal team to profit from this attempt to extort millions from Mr. Prescott.""
Bethel Zehaie told WFAA-TV in a statement that Prescott acknowledged being with the woman on the night of the alleged assault.

"March 10, 2024 5:06pm EDT",Baker Mayfield agrees to 3-year deal to remain Bucs' starting quarterback: report,Fox News,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
The Tampa Bay Buccaneers are keeping Baker Mayfield under center after the veteran quarterback agreed to a three-year deal with the team, per NFL Network.
It's a three-year pact worth $100 million with $50 million guaranteed, NFL Network added. The max value of the contract is reportedly $115 million.
Mayfield impressed the Buccaneers by helping them win the NFC South this past season and taking down the reigning NFC-champion Philadelphia Eagles at home in the wild-card round.

The Bucs had a huge quarterback question heading into last season with Tom Brady officially retiring, but Mayfield earned the starting role – one they'd like to see him in for years to come.
Vibes were very low for the Bucs this time last year after Brady made his second retirement and the future of the quarterback position became a major question to be answered.
The Bucs brought in Mayfield, who had been with the Carolina Panthers and Los Angeles Rams the year prior. This came after four seasons with the Cleveland Browns that didn’t work out the way both sides wanted.
BUCCANEERS' MIKE EVANS ‘EXTREMELY CONFIDENT’ BAKER MAYFIELD WILL REMAIN IN TAMPA BAY AS FREE AGENCY LOOMS
After going 1-5 with the Panthers and 1-3 with the Rams, Mayfield’s future in the NFL went from first overall franchise quarterback to backup quarterback status.
But he had a chance to win the Bucs job and did much more than that in 2023.
Mayfield set career highs in passing yards (4,044) and passing touchdowns (28) while throwing 10 interceptions and owning a 64.3% completion rate – again, a career-high.

The Bucs went 9-8 with him leading the offense, enough to win a mediocre NFC South title. But the statement was the 32-9 blowout the Bucs put together against the Eagles, with Mayfield throwing for 337 yards and three touchdowns.
If there was doubt Mayfield couldn’t be a playoff-caliber quarterback all season, that ended when he moved on to the next round.
The Bucs’ front office has been active in trying to run it back in 2024, as they signed Mayfield’s favorite target, wide receiver Mike Evans, to a long-term deal. They also franchise-tagged safety Antoine Winfield in hopes that they can reach an extension, too. Either way, all three key pieces will be back next season.
It's been quite the turnaround for Mayfield, who made the best of his opportunity with the Bucs on what may have been the verge of a journeyman career.

Injuries began to take a toll on him over the next four seasons. He only played in two games in 2020 and returned to play in 13 games in 2021. He also only played in 14 games in 2023.
Barkley was given the franchise tag in the 2023 offseason as the Giants elected to give Daniel Jones a lucrative contract extension. He eventually signed the franchise tender despite looking for a long-team deal as well.
In 2023, he rushed for 962 yards and six touchdowns. Despite wanting to be a Giant for life, the two sides never agreed on an extension.

Considering Wake Forest was actually expected to win, ESPN college basketball analyst Seth Greenberg is placing a lot of the blame for Filipowski's injury on Wake Forest's administration.
""Wake Forest … dropped the ball,"" Greenberg said. ""You have to have a plan in place. If you're playing this game, and you're expecting to win, you've got to hire extra security. You've got to have a plan in place to make sure these players get off the court safely. Whether it's create a blockade with your security so the students on both ends can't get on the court, you've gotta have something in place.
""Wake Forest and their administration, shame on you.""
Court storming has been a hot topic of late, particularly after an incident involving Caitlin Clark last month.

""You have to make the penalty significant enough to deter it happening,"" Kellogg said. ""Security is part of the answer, but you have to be prepared. And I think you just need to have a penalty that's extremely dissuading so that we don't have this.
""Because somebody's going to seriously get hurt, and you don't want that to happen before we do what needs to be done in regards to safety.

Rory McIlroy has been steadfast in his disapproval of LIV Golf, yet he’s softened his stance on the individuals who joined.
At first, the four-time major champion said that those who defected to LIV but eyed a return to the PGA Tour should have some sort of a punishment – but recently, he backtracked that.
It wasn’t the first time McIlroy changed his opinion on something – he once was critical of the Ryder Cup, calling it an ""exhibition,"" but in the 2021 competition, he said it was the best event in golf ""bar none.""

Those 180s are why McIlroy’s former agent, Andrew ""Chubby"" Chandler, wouldn’t be surprised if McIlroy wound up in the Saudi-backed league after all.
""It’s typical Rory,"" Chandler said of McIlroy, who once said he’d ""rather retire"" than join LIV, per Bunkered. ""Rory is not shy in having an opinion and not slow to apologize if he’s got that wrong. When he turned pro in 2008, we were sat on a bench at Gleneagles and I had Rory telling me that the Ryder Cup meant nothing at all to him. ‘It was just an exhibition match. I’m here to win majors.’ There’s nobody bigger into the Ryder Cup now than Rory McIlroy.""

JORDAN SPIETH DISQUALIFIED FROM GENESIS INVITATIONAL AFTER SIGNING INCORRECT SCORECARD
""Rory is of the ilk that he’ll say something because he likes to have an opinion, but he’s quite happy to apologize for it, and that’s what he’s done. If you were being cynical, you might say he’s going to sign for about £750 million in a month’s time with LIV because he’s paving the way that LIV’s OK now, whereas it wasn’t.
""Who knows? He doesn’t need £750m, but it’s odd what he’s done, and I’m sure it’s a possibility. If he does it or not, I don’t know, but if Rahm can do it, most guys can do it.""
Rahm, too, was once critical of LIV, even once saying that $400 million would not change his lifestyle. However, amid rumors that an offer reached $600 million, Rahm headed to LIV.

The rule would need to receive 24 votes to be enacted. The NFL changed the rule last season, allowing fair catches on kickoffs. But the Washington Post reported that rule was only made for one season.

""My perspective has been that we have to keep the kickoff in the game,"" Atlanta Falcons CEO Rich McKay told the newspaper. ""And to do that, we have to find a way to modernize it and get that play going again because that 20% return rate is not what was intended for that [fair catch] rule.""
In the XFL, kickoffs were taken from the kicking team’s 30-yard line. The members of the kicking team lined up at the receiving team’s 35-yard line and blockers on the receiving team line up on their own 30-yard line. Only the kicker and the returner can move until the ball is caught or 3 seconds after the ball hits the ground. Kickoffs that sail out of bounds or fall short of the receiving team’s 20-yard line move to the kicking team’s 45-yard line.

A touchback occurs when the ball travels into the end zone or bounces into the end zone. If it sails into the end zone without touching the ground, the receiving team gets the ball at the 35. If it bounces into the end zone, the receiving team gets the ball at the 15.

A team can request an onside kick. It has to travel at least 10 yards but not more than 20 yards. A team could also decide to go for the 4th-and-15 option instead of the kickoff. If they convert, they keep the ball.
""We just have to be open-minded enough to say: Can we bring plays back in the game that have gone out of the game? And if we can in a creative way, we should consider it,"" McKay added.

Riley Gaines has plenty of supporters since becoming the face of fighting against biological males in girls' and women's sports. Of course, that's come with plenty of critics, too.
One of her biggest is Keith Olbermann, with whom Gaines was in a war of words on X, formerly Twitter, several months ago.
Olbermann said the ""stupid"" and ""unsuccessful"" Gaines, a 12-time All-American and SEC record holder, ""sucked at swimming.""

It didn't stop there, though, as Olbermann called her a ""transphone"" who ""has no reputation to ruin.""
In a video responding to Olbermann's post, she recorded herself showing off her trophies for several of her accolades, including All-SEC first-team, three SEC titles, a second-place finish nationally, an SEC community service award, an SEC female scholar-athlete of the year and others. She also qualified for the U.S. trials for the Tokyo Olympics.
Gaines hopped on Joe Rogan's podcast this week, and the two revisited the barbs she and the former ESPN and MSNBC host traded.

RILEY GAINES REFLECTS ON WHEN SHE BECAME ADVOCATE FOR WOMEN'S SPORTS: 'WHAT IN THE WORLD ARE WE CLAPPING FOR?'
""I very proudly finished my career as a 12-time All-American, a five-time SEC champion, the SEC record holder, SEC scholar athlete of the year, SEC community services leader of the year, I can keep going on, and it’s like, this senile old man wants to attack me? He still lives with his mom in her basement. I had to ask my dad, ‘Who is this guy?’ I don’t even know who he is,"" Gaines said.
In the video, Gaines actually broke a glass trophy, but she said the SEC sent her a new one.
""They’re like, ‘We’re so sorry you had to waste your time and break a trophy over Keith Olbermann, we wanted to send you a new one,’"" she said. ""Whatever, I got more of them. Thanks, Keith Olbermann.""
""My motto is – I feel like for the most part, I pretty much live by this – ‘Don’t punch down. Don’t give someone attention when that’s clearly what they’re vying for,’"" said Gaines. ""But I literally could not resist myself when it came to him.""

Brittany Mahomes revealed Wednesday she has a fractured back related to her pregnancy.
Mahomes, wife of Kansas City Chiefs superstar quarterback Patrick Mahomes, dropped some advice to her millions of Instagram followers.
""Just your daily reminder: Once you have kids please take care of your pelvic floor,"" Mahomes wrote in the caption of her Instagram stories.

""Seriously. From: A girl with a fractured back,"" she added with a smiling emoji.
The pelvic floor is important for pregnant women because it supports the baby’s growth throughout pregnancy. Muscles within the pelvic floor also stretch, making them weaker during and after the child’s birth.
BRITTANY MAHOMES SHARES DEFIANT MESSAGE AFTER LATEST SCRUTINY: ‘STAY BOTHERED’
The 28-year-old shares two children with the Chiefs star — 3-year-old Sterling and 1-year-old Bronze.
She didn’t, however, explain how she fractured her back. Mahomes works out routinely, and she traveled a lot last season, which culminated in the Chiefs winning the Super Bowl in Las Vegas.
The Mahomes family also celebrated Sterling’s third birthday Feb. 19, just one week after the Super Bowl victory.

Brittany and Patrick were also together at the Chiefs’ Super Bowl parade in Kansas City, which ended tragically when one person was killed and many more were injured during a shooting near Union Station, where a large crowd gathered.
The Mahomes visited a hospital two days later to meet with wounded victims and offer their support.

Jason Kelce’s 45-minute retirement speech was filled with a mixed bag of emotions. However, while there were many tears falling from Kelce’s face, there were also plenty of laughs.
Former Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Nick Foles has an infamous nickname, ""Big D--- Nick,"" and Kelce referenced that it was not just a nickname after his signature ""Philly Special"" call during the Super Bowl in 2018 – a win over the New England Patriots.
""I won’t forget Nick Foles having the biggest game of his life, on the biggest stage possible, and the biggest d--- on the team, going up to Doug Pederson, and asking for the Philly Special,"" Kelce said.

Kelce made sure to show his props to Pederson, who trusted Foles to go for the trick-play quarterback touchdown catch.
""And Doug Pederson having the biggest b---s in the stadium…to say, ‘Yeah, let’s do it.’""
It would be the only Super Bowl victory of Kelce’s illustrious 13-year career, as the Eagles lost to the Kansas City Chiefs two seasons ago in the ""Big Game.""
EAGLES' JASON KELCE ANNOUNCES RETIREMENT FROM NFL
Foles’ touchdown catch became Philadelphia folklore when he hauled it in to help the Eagles beat Tom Brady and the Patriots, 41-33. Foles finished the game with 373 passing yards and a touchdown pass to Alshon Jeffery.
Kelce had to stop multiple times throughout his speech to fight back tears, with his family – his wife, Kylie, his parents, Donna and Ed Kelce, and his brother, Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce – doing the same.

It has been years in the making for Kelce, who admitted that he has been wrestling with the thought of retirement for the past few seasons. He is finally calling it quits following the Eagles’ loss in the wild card round of the NFL Playoffs to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
""No one celebrates their own like the city of Philadelphia,"" Kelce said during his speech. ""Athletes become demigods in this city.""
Kelce, a sixth-round pick by Philadelphia, became a seven-time Pro Bowler and a six-time All-Pro selection over his 13 years of providing a constant presence at the center position. His leadership was also lauded during his time in the building.
""Although last season truly sucked, I wouldn’t trade my team with you or those teams for the world,"" Kelce said.

New York Giants legend Tiki Barber is taking the news that Saquon Barkley will be signing with the Philadelphia Eagles harshly.
In fact, Barber believes everything Barkley has done with the Giants over the past six seasons has been washed away because he decided to go south and play for the NFC East rival.
""He’s dead to us now. You’re dead to us,"" Barber said to Barkley over the airwaves on WFAN’s ""Evan and Tiki"" Monday afternoon. ""Good luck, you’re dead to me.""

Barber said an equivalent to this recently on his show when news came out that Barkley was reportedly thinking about heading to the Eagles.
""The fact that Saquon would even contemplate going to play for that team in Philadelphia is insulting to his Giant history and legacy,"" Barber explained.
""Go to Baltimore, go to Houston, go to LA Chargers. Do not go to the Philadelphia Eagles, that appreciate and respect and reverence we have for you, Saquon, will be lost. Will be gone.""
SAQUON BARKLEY, EAGLES AGREE TO 3-YEAR DEAL: REPORTS
Barkley didn’t listen to one of the Giants legends he previously said he wanted to be while with the team. He agreed to a three-year deal worth $37.75 million, and it could go up to $46.76 million with incentives. He will get $26 million guaranteed at signing when the new league year kicks in March 13.
Barkley all but confirmed the deal on X.

""Thank you to everyone who has shown me love and support over the past 6 years… forever grateful!"" he tweeted. ""Excited for the next chapter.""
Barkley followed up that post with two eagle emojis, while also retweeting now-teammate Darius Slay’s post about the news.
""Yes sir!! We Litty @saquon welcome my guy!"" Slay said to the running back who will play his former team twice a year now.
Barber is the Giants’ all-time leading rusher with 10,449 yards, and was someone Barkley aspired to pass after being drafted No. 2 overall in 2018. Barkley has said numerous times prior to his Eagles deal that he wanted to remain a Giant for life, but GM Joe Schoen couldn’t find common ground with him last season when he was slapped with the franchise tag.

Golden Richards, the former Dallas Cowboys wide receiver known for his famous Super Bowl XII catch against the Denver Broncos, died on Friday, his family said. He was 73.
In a Facebook post, Richards’ nephew Lance Richards said the former NFL player died of congestive heart failure at his home in Murray, Utah.

""My uncle Golden passed away peacefully this morning,"" Lance Richards wrote. ""I will forever remember going hunting and talking Dallas Cowboy football. He was a kind and sweet soul, and I’m so happy he’s not suffering anymore.""
The Cowboys selected Richards in the second round of the 1973 NFL Draft out of BYU. He played in 12 games during his rookie season but became a starter by his sophomore year in 1974.
Richards played more than five seasons with the Cowboys before he eventually lost his starting job in the middle of the 1978 season. Dallas traded him to the Chicago Bears, where he would play in 20 games between the 1978 and 1979 seasons.

He signed with the Denver Broncos in 1980 but never saw the field with them as he suffered a season-ending injury. He retired shortly afterward.
Richards is most famous for his catch against the Broncos in Super Bowl XII. He caught a 29-yard pass from Robert Newhouse for the game-sealing touchdown.
In his post-playing career, Richards battled health problems. He was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease in 2011. His brother, Doug, said Golden broke his hip in 2022 and needed four surgeries.
""He has left us and gone to a better place,"" Doug Richards said. ""He fought pretty good there to the end, until it was his time.""

The New York Times, which first reported that Rodgers and former WWE star and Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura were on Kennedy's list, said the four-time NFL MVP ""welcomed"" the idea.
Neither Rodgers' agent nor the Jets immediately responded to a request for comment.
Rodgers has been outspoken about his support for Kennedy, even saying he would like to be in a tag-team match with Kennedy as his partner against Dr. Anthony Fauci and ""Mr. Pfizer"" Travis Kelce. When he dropped that bomb, he referred to RFK Jr. as ""my man.""
Last April, Rodgers wrote #kennedy2024"" on his Instagram story, and supported him in another post on what was then Twitter.

You can mark one NFL team that won’t be chasing after Russell Wilson when he becomes a free agent on March 13.
Carolina Panthers head coach Dave Canales, making an appearance on the ""Up & Adams"" show with Kay Adams, is already taking his new team out of the potential sweepstakes that could be coming when the Denver Broncos release Wilson following his tumultuous two seasons with the team.
""This is not the situation for Russ,"" Canales said bluntly.

Canales has a history with Wilson, as his coaching career in the NFL mostly comes with the Seattle Seahawks — the team Wilson won a Super Bowl with and led an offense with from 2012-2021 before being traded to the Broncos.
Canales joined the Seahawks in 2010 and was there through the 2022 season, where he helped Geno Smith, Wilson’s successor, become the NFL Comeback Player of the Year.
Canales moved on to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to become their new offensive coordinator in 2023, and after a successful season with Baker Mayfield leading his squad, he took the head coaching vacancy with the Panthers.
BRONCOS TO RELEASE RUSSELL WILSON AFTER 2 SEASONS
While Wilson has caught a lot of flak since the Broncos announced their intentions to move on and eat millions left on his contract, Canales gave props to the man he used to work with closely.
""What I will say about him is taking that chance and that opportunity to go to Denver, I really admire him for that,"" he said. ""I really admire the courage it took to say, ‘I’m gonna branch out away from what I’m comfortable with.’
""Certainly guys like me who was with him for all 10 years and the level of comfort that comes — I know exactly what he wants, he needs, what he’s gonna ask for. I can anticipate those things. He really gambled on himself to go and try to do something a different way to see what that can become. What it’s become, hey, the film’s out there, but I really credit him for that.""
Dave Canales answers a question at a press conference introducing him as the new head coach for the Carolina Panthers NFL football team in Charlotte, N.C., Thursday, Feb. 1, 2024.  (AP Photo/Nell Redmond)
Canales’ initial answer to Adams here is expected considering the Panthers just took Bryce Young No. 1 overall in last year’s NFL Draft. He had a very rocky start to his career, going 2-14 with 2,877 yards passing, 11 touchdowns and 10 interceptions.
The Panthers are a tremendous work in progress, but they’re clearly focused on Young’s development as their franchise quarterback. Owner David Tepper believes Canales, who was an outside-the-box hire to many, is the man that can help Young reach his full potential.
As for Wilson, there are many quarterback-needy teams in the NFL that could be aggressive for his services next season. He said recently on the ""I AM ATHLETE"" podcast that he does have the desire to win more Super Bowls before calling it quits for his career.
Teams like the Atlanta Falcons, Minnesota Vikings and more may be in the running for Wilson when the new league year begins on March 13. The Broncos are also reportedly allowing Wilson to contact teams now to get a headstart on free agency.

Although the Manasquan school district decided to take legal action regarding an egregious referee error, members of the high school's boys basketball team showed tremendous sportsmanship on Saturday.
The Jersey Shore high school thought they had won a trip to the Group 2 state championship after a buzzer-beater against Camden earlier this week. However, officials gathered afterward and reversed the call, giving Camden a 46-45 victory.
But numerous videos showed that the basket should have counted. The New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association admitted the ""error"" but said the decision could not be reversed.

Manasquan earned a trip to the state finals, but did not play in it.
Manasquan's lawsuit asked for the championship game to be put on hold, but it took place on Saturday afternoon at Rutgers University, with Camden winning their second title in three years.
Although they weren't on the court, Manasquan players still made the trip north to the Rutgers campus to watch the game, and when Camden won the title, Squan players gave Camden a standing ovation.
It should be noted that the Manasquan girls' team are playing in their state final at Rutgers on Saturday afternoon, so perhaps they were there to show school spirit. But it cannot be denied that they showed sportsmanship when they certainly did not have to, considering that they should have been on the court, not in the stands.
Manasquan's class act came amid backlash the Camden athletic director has received over the last 24 hours.

Schnell continued that marketing tactics have centered around Caitlin Clark, Sabrina Ionescu and Paige Bueckers.
""Too often, the Black players who built women’s hoops — and who now dominate the professional level, where the WNBA is 70% Black — haven’t been acknowledged,"" she continued.
""Part of that has to do with position. Casual fans fall hard for playmakers, athletes who have the ball in their hands and create shots. Paint players might have great footwork, but that doesn’t usually translate to highlight reels. Consider that power forward A’ja Wilson, arguably the best player in the world, whose award résumé is longer than a Walgreens receipt, doesn’t have near the star power of Clark.""

"March 8, 2024 6:51am EST",T-Wolves' Anthony Edwards smashes head on rim during nasty game-winning blocked shot,Fox News,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Minnesota Timberwolves All-Star guard Anthony Edwards might have had one of the best game-winning blocks in NBA history on Thursday night against the Indiana Pacers – one that left his head hurting.
With the Timberwolves owning a 113-111 lead with just seconds to play in the fourth quarter, Edwards could not hit the dagger two-pointer, and the Pacers got the rebound with time to go down the floor and tie it.
Pacers guard Aaron Nesmith received a long pass, and it looked like he was going to have a good chance to tie the game with his layup. However, Edwards came flying out of nowhere and swatted the ball away just before the final buzzer sounded.

Not only did he secure the victory for his team, but Edwards got up so high that he smashed his head on the rim before a nasty fall to the ground.

""I think on the rim,"" Edwards said after the game smiling while holding his head. ""It’s hurting real bad and I landed on my wrist. But, I mean, you know I saw him in the lane. I knew he was going for the layup, and I was like, ‘Man, I’m finna go get this.’

""I ain’t never jumped that high in my life.""
While Edwards’ block was the defining moment of the night, what he did for Minnesota with the score tied 105 apiece and 1:14 left in the fourth quarter was the definition of putting the team on his back.

First, Edwards hit a three-pointer that made it 108-105, and after the Pacers missed their attempt on the other end, he hit a pull-up shot for two to make it a five-point game.
The Pacers were able to cut the lead to 110-108 for the T-Wolves, but Edwards hit a floater that furthered the lead a bit more with 21.2 seconds left.
Edwards ended the game with a team-high 44 points on 18-of-35 from the field, including 3-of-7 from three-point land with six rebounds, three assists, two steals and two blocks.

As all the Allstate commercials go with Mayhem, Bird starts to cause destruction all in his attic. He began swiping at Mayhem with a lacrosse stick, knocking off his possession in the process.

"March 7, 2024 7:07pm EST","Bears, Jaylon Johnson agree to massive 4-year extension after being hit with franchise tag",Fox News,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
The franchise tag didn’t last long on Chicago Bears cornerback Jaylon Johnson after the team announced Thursday that they agreed to a four-year extension to keep him in the Windy City long term.
Johnson’s extension has a price tag of $76 million with $54 million guaranteed, according to ESPN. The math over four years brings Johnson’s annual average value to $19 million per season.
Johnson was the Bears’ choice to get hit with the franchise tag before the March 5 deadline at 4 p.m., though it was reported both sides wanted to continue working on a long-term deal.

During the 2023 season, Johnson had actually put in a request to be traded from the Bears before the NFL deadline, but Chicago GM Ryan Poles kept him on the roster. Since then, they’ve been building their relationship back, and the Bears clearly value the 2020 second-round pick to keep him in the team’s secondary for years to come.
The move to sign Johnson long term is something Poles alluded to last week, when he expressed confidence in getting a deal done.
49ERS' DEEBO SAMUEL DELIVERS HARD TRUTH ON LOSING 2 SUPER BOWLS IN 5 YEARS
It’s the third long-term deal Poles has made for his team’s defense. He locked up edge rusher Montez Sweat on a $98 million deal over four years following the trade with the Washington Commanders last season. And he signed linebacker Tremaine Edmunds to a four-year, $72 million pact in free agency this time last year.

The Bears still have ample cap space to work with this offseason, though Poles will continue to focus on having two first-round picks in this year’s NFL Draft, including the No. 1 overall selection.
What Poles will do with quarterback Justin Fields, given the speculation that the team will take one of the top QB prospects available with that top pick, also remains to be seen.
As for Johnson, he’s earned his big payday after a career season in which he hauled in four interceptions, one of which was a pick-six, defended 10 passes and collected 36 combined tackles over 14 starts. He earned second-team All-Pro honors and made his first Pro Bowl, as well.

Johnson turns 25 in April and is a young piece the rebuilding Bears believe can anchor a secondary that includes cornerback Kyler Gordon, safety Jaquan Brisker and defensive back Elijah Hicks. More help could also come in free agency, where safeties in particular are available.

A Missouri hospital confirmed Friday that individuals who attended the frigid Kansas City Chiefs-Miami Dolphins wild card round game in January had to undergo amputations due to frostbite.
Research Medical Center in Kansas City said that 12 of those treated for frostbite during the cold snap two months ago, some of whom coming from the January 13 game at Arrowhead Stadium, needed amputations involving mostly fingers and toes.
The hospital also said more surgeries are expected over the next two to four weeks.

Research Medical Center didn’t give an exact number of frostbite victims during the 11-day cold snap, though Dr. Megan Garcia of the Grossman Burn Center at the hospital told FOX 4 that 70% of those patients are now being advised to schedule amputations.
""People think of burns, they think of fire, they think of hot thermal injuries,"" she said. ""But burns can happen from many different causes.
CHIEFS FANS THAT SUFFERED FROSTBITE AT 4TH-COLDEST GAME IN NFL HISTORY NOW FACE POSSIBILITY OF AMPUTATION
""The patients who had their frostbite injuries along with the Chiefs game, they are just getting to the point now we are starting to discuss their amputations that might be necessary.""
The temperature at kickoff for the Chiefs-Dolphins bout was minus-4 degrees Fahrenheit, while wind gusts had the game at minus-27 degrees Fahrenheit, making it the fourth-coldest game in NFL history.

But Chiefs fans flood the stadium no matter the temperature, and some of them dared to defy the frigid air with many being seen with a lack of layers, or simply showing skin in the seats during the game.
The coldest game ever recorded in NFL history came in the 1967 NFL championship, where the Green Bay Packers took down the Dallas Cowboys at a minus-13 Fahrenheit Lambeau Field. It’s been fittingly called the ""Ice Bowl.""
The Chiefs went on to win that game against the Dolphins this year, their first playoff victory on the road to back-to-back Super Bowl wins.

Three-time All-Star Ben Simmons will once again end an NBA season on the injured list.
The 27-year-old point guard will miss the rest of the season due to the ongoing discomfort he is experiencing in his back, the Brooklyn Nets announced on Thursday. The Nets confirmed that Simmons will now spend some time seeking out treatment options in an effort to address the nerve in his back.
""Ben Simmons will remain out for the remainder of the season while he consults with specialists and explores treatment options for the nerve impingement in his lower back,"" the team said in a statement. ""Simmons, along with his representatives and Nets medical personnel, are currently in discussions with numerous experts to determine the course of action that will provide him with the best opportunity for long-term sustainable health.""

He has only appeared in 15 of Brooklyn's 62 games so far this season.
After missing a significant amount of time in the early portion of the season, Simmons returned to the lineup in January. However, after just nine games, Simmons was sidelined again with an injury.
BEN SIMMONS' AGENT TAKES RESPONSIBILITY FOR NETS STAR'S ONGOING INJURY WOES
Simmons' mental health played a role in his extended absence when he was a member of the Philadelphia 76ers, but his physical health has seemed to cause more setbacks since he landed in Brooklyn. Simmons held out during the 2021-22 season. The holdout was ultimately compounded by his back issues, which resulted in Simmons missing the entire season.

In two-plus seasons with the Nets, Simmons has missed 121 of 178 possible games. He averaged 6.1 points and 5.7 assists over his 15 appearances this season.
Simmons signed a five-year, $170 million extension in 2019. He is owed an estimated $40.3 million on his expiring contract for the 2024-25 season. Simmons, the top overall selection in the 2016 NBA Draft, has attempted to work through the back injuries without undergoing surgery.

Mike Evans was set to be one of the biggest names on the free-agent market once the NFL offseason officially began, but on Monday, he decided to stick with the team that drafted him.

""Fire Them Cannons,"" Evans’ post read.
The star wide receiver agreed to a two-year deal worth $52 million, FOX Sports reported.
Evans has earned the title of greatest wide receiver in franchise history as he is on pace to achieve a mark only seen by Pro Football Hall of Famer Jerry Rice.
The five-time Pro Bowler has 10 consecutive seasons with at least 1,000 yards receiving. Rice had 11 consecutive seasons with at least 1,000 yards receiving as he played with Hall of Famers Joe Montana and Steve Young.

What makes Evans’ mark possibly even more impressive is that his starting quarterbacks ranged from Tom Brady to Jameis Winston to Josh McCown to Baker Mayfield, with a bevy of backup quarterbacks in between.
Evans broke Randy Moss’ record for most consecutive 1,000-yard receiving seasons to start a season with eight. He is also the third player in NFL history with 10 1,000-yard receiving seasons, with Rice and Moss. Rice had 14 during his illustrious career.
Last season, Evans led the NFL for the first time with 13 touchdown catches. He also had 1,255 receiving yards as Tampa Bay won the NFC South title.

Nike and Major League Baseball have caught flack for the new baseball jerseys this year due to their ""cheap"" look.
That is what pitchers Rich Hill and Miles Mikolas said of the uniforms, despite other players' promoting their stretchiness and lighter feel.
However, a recent photo may have revealed that the jerseys' pants are a bit too light.

Nike’s new on-field Vapor Premier uniforms for the 2024 MLB season were recently revealed as pitchers and catchers reported for spring training.
San Francisco Giants' Casey Schmitt modeled the jerseys during the team's recent photo shoot day, but apparently, he modeled something else.
Other photos have shown jerseys clearly tucked in thanks to the thin-looking pants, and in Schmitt's photo, he accidentally revealed a little bit too much.

The photo went viral amid concerns about the jerseys since the start of the month.
The last names on the back of jerseys look noticeably smaller, leading to most fans complaining about them. However, MLB senior vice president of global consumer products Denis Nolan maintained that the uniforms are top-notch.
""In acquiring Majestic and its MLB uniform manufacturing facilities in Easton, PA -- which have been making player uniforms for nearly two decades -- Fanatics has consistently produced world-class uniforms, including every Nike-branded MLB on-field jersey and all City Connect gear since 2020,"" Nolan said, via MLB.com.

The New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association (NJSIAA) Group 2 semifinals between Manasquan High School and Camden High School came down to the wire. Camden went up one point on a foul shot from Alijah Curry with 5.8 seconds left, and Manasquan had to go the length of the floor to win the game.
Manasquan’s Rey Weinseimer missed a 3-pointer from the wing, but his teammate Griffin Linstra was there to grab the rebound and put the shot back in for what the team thought was the game-winning basket. The Manasquan fans went wild as Camden was in disbelief.

Los Angeles Dodgers star Mookie Betts keeps adding reasons as to why he's one of the best players in this generation of baseball.
The two-time World Series winner has always been known for his ability to play just about anywhere on the diamond, but he has performed exceptionally as an outfielder.
In fact, Betts has won six Gold Gloves as an outfielder — yet he's always been able to play the infield in a pinch. He actually came up as an infielder, but the Boston Red Sox moved him in the minors.

Actually, out of necessity, Betts became the Dodgers' full-time second baseman in the second half of last season.
On Friday, Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said Betts playing the infield will be ""permanent, for now."" However, he won't be playing second.
Instead, Betts is making the move to shortstop, a position he did not play at the big league level until last year, making just 12 starts on the left side of the diamond — although he was drafted as a shortstop.
Betts manned second base last year due to injuries around the infield, but as Gavin Lux aims to live up to his top-prospect hype, Roberts says Lux, who was slated to start at short this year, will be moving to second.

BLUE JAYS PITCHER ERIK SWANSON SHARES POSITIVE UPDATE NEARLY 2 WEEKS AFTER 4-YEAR-OLD SON WAS STRUCK BY SUV
Earlier in the offseason, Roberts had said it was likely that Betts was going to be the Opening Day second baseman, ending his time in the outfield for the foreseeable future.
Lux is not unfamiliar with second — it's actually where he's spent most of his time in the majors, playing the middle infield with Trea Turner during his time with Los Angeles.
However, Lux missed the 2023 season with a torn ACL, and missed substantial time with injuries in the previous two seasons, so perhaps Roberts wants him in a familiar spot for his first MLB game in a year and a half.
Betts has played just 98.0 MLB innings at short, but no one else on the Dodgers has played one there. So, insert Betts.

Meanwhile, the Dodgers' outfield is loaded with Teoscar Hernandez, James Outman and Jason Heyward, while Chris Taylor and Kike Hernandez can both play just about anywhere on the diamond.
Superstar Shohei Ohtani will also be a full-time DH this season as he recovers from elbow surgery, so the shift keeps Lux's bat (and obviously Betts') in the lineup.
Betts could become only the second player in MLB history to win a Gold Glove Award as both an infielder and an outfielder, joining former star Darin Erstad.
If all goes as planned, Betts would also become the only player in MLB history to play 1,000 games in the outfield and 100 games at both second and short.

""It’s a great sell to the kids that will listen to it,"" Smart said, via On3 Sports. ""There is a lot of them that want to ask about NIL. They don’t want to ask about what your NFL players have done. I think it’s much more important how you develop players than how much NIL you can give them.""
Smart’s remarks came as former Alabama football coach Nick Saban assailed the importance of NIL over the last year. He revealed to ESPN earlier this month that it was a part of the reason why he retired. He said players were asking for ""assurances"" they were definitely going to play and ""How much are you going to pay me?"" Saban said the program was intended to build for the players’ futures and possible NFL careers.
""So I'm saying to myself, 'Maybe this doesn't work anymore, that the goals and aspirations are just different and that it's all about how much money can I make as a college player,’"" Saban added.
""I'm not saying that's bad. I'm not saying it's wrong, I'm just saying that's never been what we were all about, and it's not why we had success through the years.""

Saban then talked about NIL in a roundtable discussion on Capitol Hill earlier this week.
""All the things I’ve believed in for all these years – 50 years of coaching – no longer exist in college athletics,"" Saban said when asked by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, if the ""current chaos"" in college sports led to his retirement. ""It always was about developing players, always been about helping people be more successful in life.
""My wife even said to me – we have all the recruits over on Sunday with their parents for breakfast. She would always meet with the mothers and talk about how she was going to help impact their sons and how they would be well taken care of. She came to me right before I retired and said, ‘Why are we doing this?’ I said, ‘What do you mean?’ She said, ‘All they care about is how much you’re going to pay them. They don’t care about how you’re going to develop them, which is what we’ve always done. So why are you doing this?’
""To me, that was sort of a red alert that we really are creating a circumstance here that is not beneficial to the young people, which is why I always did what I did. My dad did it, I did it. So that’s the reason I always like college athletics more than the NFL because you had the opportunity to develop young people.""

"March 8, 2024 5:15am EST","Dartmouth players unionizing could result in 'domino effect' for college sports, expert says",Fox News,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
The Dartmouth men’s basketball team has taken a historic first step in challenging the norms of college athletics, voting Tuesday to unionize.
The team voted 13-2 to join Service Employees International Union Local 560, which already represents some of the school’s employees, in an election supervised by the National Labor Relations Board.
The vote comes after college athletes began profiting off their name, image and likeness.
However, schools are not legally required to pay their athletes.

The vote to unionize was met with immediate pushback from the school, but one expert says the school may be fighting a losing battle.
Michael Schreck, the founder of the Collegiate Sports Management Group, says the vote could be a huge step forward for college athletes.
""You gotta give the kids credit for trying to do it. How does it get legitimized? I don’t know. Do other players at schools have the wherewithal, the bandwidth or the hutzpah to go try to pull this off? I don’t know,"" Schreck said in a recent interview with Fox News Digital.
""But, hey, they got the ear of somebody, and they banded together and tried to figure this out. I’m really excited to watch and see how that all plays out.
""They do have an argument. … If it all goes through the way they want it to, it’s going to be a domino effect quickly.""

Schreck also said it's not surprising athletes from an Ivy League school, who likely won't make much NIL money, took this step.
""You’re not on (a) sports scholarship, but you’re on some type of academic scholarship. So, how does that parlay into what they’re trying to pull off and accomplish? That’s the interesting piece to this,"" Schreck says.
""It’s interesting to me that when you look at it, Yale, Princeton, Harvard are the best three academics in the Ivy League. Why didn’t one of those schools try to do it? I think everybody wanted to see if these kids from Dartmouth are going to try to pull this off, but what’s the fallout?""
Dartmouth quickly filed an appeal with the NLRB in hopes of overturning a decision last month that set the rules for this week’s vote.

""For Ivy League students who are varsity athletes, academics are of primary importance, and athletic pursuit is part of the educational experience,"" the school said in a statement. ""Classifying these students as employees simply because they play basketball is as unprecedented as it is inaccurate. We, therefore, do not believe unionization is appropriate.""

"March 8, 2024 8:18pm EST",Top MLB prospect gets 80-game suspension after positive PED test,Fox News,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Top MLB prospect Noelvi Marte burst onto the scene for the Cincinnati Reds last year after being a late-season callup.
The infielder made his MLB debut on Aug. 19, and he gave Reds fans more of a reason to be optimistic about the team's short- and long-term futures.
Marte, 22, hit .316 with an .822 OPS in his 35 games, and entering this season, he was the Reds' top prospect and the 21st ranked in all of baseball.

However, the Reds will need to change their Opening Day plans, as well as their plans going into this summer.
That's because Marte has been suspended 80 games after testing positive for performance-enhancing drugs.
Marté signed with the Seattle Mariners from the Dominican Republic for a $1.55 million bonus in July 2018. He was traded to the Reds in July 2022, along with three other prospects, for All-Star right-hander Luis Castillo.
Under the rules, a first suspension is worth 80 games, while a second offense results in a full-season ban. A third positive test would lead to the player being banned permanently.

Marte was expected to be the Reds' starting third baseman this season, joining Cincinnati's core of young players that includes Elly De La Cruz, Matt McLain, Spencer Steer and Christian Encarnacion-Strand.
The Reds had perhaps their most impressive season in quite some time last year — they went 82-80 and even led the NL Central in early August. The team was officially eliminated from postseason contention on the penultimate night of the regular season. It came just two years after winning 83 games, but the Reds were expected to finish well below .500 and shocked just about everyone.

"March 12, 2024 9:09pm EDT",NBA champion Isiah Thomas demands Michael Jordan issue a public apology,Fox News,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Michael Jordan's name is synonymous with NBA greatness. Millions of fans continue to hold onto fond memories of Jordan's storied run with the Chicago Bulls. But, over the years some players who suited up in the same era as Jordan have spoken out against the six-time champion.
Jordan's former teammate Scottie Pippen has been one of the more vocal critics, describing him as ""horrible,"" in the early portion of his career. Two-time NBA champion Isiah Thomas seems to have also had his fair share of issues with Jordan over the years.
However, Thomas' current problem with Jordan stems from the ""The Last Dance"" documentary. From Thomas' point of view, he believed that he was on good terms with Jordan — at least until he watched the miniseries.

At one point during ""The Last Dance,"" Jordan called Thomas an offensive name. Thomas took issue with the comments and during an appearance on the latest edition of ""The Draymond Green Show,"" the Detroit Pistons legend doubled down on his refusal to forgive Jordan.

Thomas also outlined what would have to happen in order for the two to get back in good standing.
""This dude got on international television and called me a--hole, somebody who’s been really good to him,"" Thomas told Green. ""If you didn’t mean it, say it publicly. If you meant it, I understand. I’m good with that.""

Jordan suggested that Thomas was aware of his perception across the NBA during his playing days.
""The reaction of the public has kind of changed his perspective,"" Jordan noted in ""The Last Dance"". ""You can show me anything you want, there’s no way you can convince me he wasn’t an a--hole.""
In the documentary, which explored Jordan's final season in Chicago, the six-time NBA Finals MVP also addressed the long-standing rumor that he was responsible for Thomas' exclusion from the 1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team, which became known as the ""Dream Team.""
There was speculation at the time that Jordan claimed he would only participate if Thomas was left off the roster. But, Jordan pushed back against the idea saying he did not explicitly request that Thomas was not on the team.

The NXXT Women's Pro Tour, a professional women’s golf tour based in Florida, has updated its policy to ban transgender athletes from competition, announcing Friday that only competitors who are ""biological female at birth"" will be able to participate in tour-sanctioned events.

Las Vegas Raiders new GM Tom Telesco made his first big splash this offseason, signing former Miami Dolphins defensive tackle Christian Wilkins to a massive four-year, $110 million deal, his agent David Mulugheta told ESPN.
Wilkins will have $84.75 million of that contract guaranteed, as the 28-year-old gets a big payday in day one of the NFL’s contract negotiating window.
Wilkins made NFL history this past season, racking up 98 tackles, a new record for a defensive tackle in a single campaign.

Many of those tackles came in stopping the run, a trait Wilkins has shown since breaking into the league with the Dolphins as the 13th overall pick of the 2019 NFL Draft. Over his five seasons, he has a run-stop win rate of 39%, ranking eighth among defensive tackles, per ESPN.
Considering the Raiders were 21st in rushing yards allowed per game last season (118.5), signing Wilkins makes sense. It also allowed the likes of Maxx Crosby to possibly get less attention considering Wilkins can get into the backfield and sack the quarterback.

The Dolphins were interested in giving Wilkins a long-term extension, but both sides couldn’t find an agreement last offseason. He, instead, played on his fifth-year option, and the Dolphins didn’t franchise tag him, leaving the possibility that he could go elsewhere.
For his career, Wilkins has totaled 355 tackles, four forced fumbles, 43 tackles for loss, 50 quarterback hits, and 19 passes defended over 81 games.

A former college track and field coach was sentenced to five years in prison, to be followed by three years of supervised release, after he tricked hundreds of women into sending him naked photos of themselves.
Steve Waithe ran a scheme in which he obtained ""thousands"" of explicit photos from ""over 100 women"" through fake email and social media accounts.

After he no longer worked for the school, he operated over 20 sham accounts, and even made up two female personas, and reached out to many women regarding a fake study for athletes in which he requested photos to ""track their progress"" — he recommended the photos ""show as much skin as possible.""
He also cyberstalked another individual, hacking into her Snapchat account and finding more nude photos, and offered to exchange such photos on other websites.
""This defendant’s conduct is deplorable. He exploited his trusted role as a coach to college athletes to engage in a sextortion campaign that has left a trail of emotional devastation in its wake. We stand by the courageous victims who came forward and help this Office hold Mr. Waithe accountable. The array of on-line threats is striking, and this Office will be vigilant in investigating and prosecuting those who sexually exploit victims,"" said Acting United States Attorney Joshua S.

Two-time Pro Bowler and longtime New York Giants star running back Saquon Barkley appears headed for free agency for the first time in his NFL career.
The Giants have decided not to use the franchise tag on the now-pending free agent Barkley, ESPN's Adam Schefter and others reported on Tuesday. NFL teams had until Tuesday to decide whether to apply the restrictive roster marker on players.
Last week, Giants general manager Joe Schoen said he was hopeful that Barkley could end up back with the team in 2024. ""He's a guy we'd like to have back,"" Schoen told reporters at the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis.

Schoen also noted that he had time set aside to meet with Barkley's representatives to talk about the running back's potential future with the Giants.
BRONCOS TO RELEASE RUSSELL WILSON AFTER 2 SEASONS
Last March, the Giants decided to place the non-exclusive franchise tag on Barkley. His one-year contract was later adjusted. Barkley was the second overall selection in the 2018 NFL Draft and has spent his entire professional football career in New York.

Tagging Barkley would have cost the Giants an estimated $12.1 million for the upcoming season.
Barkley's production dipped slightly last year, but he was still highly productive and finished his 2023 campaign with 1,650 yards from scrimmage. He rushed for 1,312 yards in 2022, and ended the 2023 season with 962 yards on the ground.

A report also surfaced on Tuesday stating that the Giants could be ready to move on from quarterback Daniel Jones. Barkley has been a key part of Jones' success over the past couple of years, as the offensive system under head coach Brian Daboll has leaned heavily on the running back.
Schoen did note that he was ""pleasantly surprised"" the NFL's salary cap is expected to increase significantly in 2024 to a reported $255.4 million.
Barkley's injury history has likely been a sticking point in contract negotiations. Ankle injuries set him back in 2021 and last season. He suffered a torn ACL and MCL in 2020.

However, Schoen downplayed any injury concerns and expressed his belief that Barkley would continue to produce in the future.
""I think the world of Saquon and I still think he can play,"" Schoen said. ""So, my value for Saquon really hasn't changed. Unfortunately, throughout the process, starting back in November of 2022, we weren't able to come to an agreement in terms of where we both thought a deal made sense.""

MASSACHUSETTS SCHOOL RIPS 'HARMFUL COMMENTS' MADE TOWARD TRANSGENDER ATHLETE ACCUSED OF INJURING OPPONENT
The Indiana ruling was handed down by a panel of justices on the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago. It was the latest decision in a legal challenge the ACLU of Indiana filed against the ban.
The initial laws were set to go into effect on July 1, 2023. But a month before, U.S. District Court Judge James Patrick Hanlon issued an injunction preventing most of it from taking effect. Hanlon blocked the state from prohibiting minors’ access to hormone therapies and puberty blocks but allowed the ban on gender surgery to take effect.
Hanlon’s order also blocked provisions that would ban Indiana doctors from communicating with out-of-state doctors about gender surgery for patients younger than 18.
""As we and our clients consider our next steps, we want all the transgender youth of Indiana to know this fight is far from over,"" the ACLU of Indiana said in a statement. ""We will continue to challenge this law until it is permanently defeated and Indiana is made a safer place to raise every family.""

While Robinson didn’t have Parsons beat, NFL Network compared Robinson's sprint to the San Francisco 49ers’ Nick Bosa and Houston Texans’ Will Anderson Jr., both top five picks in their respective drafts. And Robinson was faster than both.
Robinson’s 10-yard split of 1.54 seconds was the fastest mark ever recorded by an edge rusher who weighs at least 250 pounds, showing how this speed at his size is unheard of.
Robinson excelled elsewhere at the combine, recording a 34½-inch vertical leap and a 10-foot, 8-inch broad jump.

He became the first prospect since Vernon Davis, the San Francisco 49ers tight end who went No. 6 overall out of Maryland in the 2006 NFL Draft, to post a 40-yard dash at 4.5 seconds or less and record a broad jump of at least 10½ feet.
Robinson, already considered a first-round talent, could go earlier than previously projected April 25 when the draft kicks off.
Robinson initially began his college career at Maryland before transferring to Penn State in 2022. He had a standout sophomore season with 5½ sacks, 26 combined tackles and 10 tackles for loss.

Washington played for the Kansas City Royals, Montreal Expos and Pittsburgh Pirates from 1977 to 1987. He hit .251 with 27 home runs and 255 RBI in 907 career games. He helped the Royals to an American League pennant in 1980 when he hit .364 with an RBI and a double against the New York Yankees.

Washington was a fan favorite for what he had in his mouth as he played — a toothpick. He explained to The Kansas City Star he chose to keep the toothpick in his mouth because tobacco burned his mouth. The toothpick reached a fever pitch in 1980 sparking talk about potentially banning it in MLB. But it never came to fruition.
""I’d much rather be remembered as a pretty good player, but I realize most people will remember me as the guy with the toothpick,"" the told the Oklahoman in 1988.

Philadelphia Phillies outfielder Nick Castellanos is back with another odd quote heading into the 2024 season.
During an interview with The Athletic’s Matt Gelb, Castellanos was discussing how he fits in the Phillies’ lineup this year, and he gave an interesting answer.
""There’s a lot of baseball players that are like milk,"" Castellanos told The Athletic. ""Milk is only good when it’s fresh. And then, as you leave it out a while, it spoils. There are some other baseball players that are like wine. What happens with wine?""

Gelb answered the question from Castellanos in the article, saying wine ages well.""Exactly,"" Castellanos responded. ""Those are the only two kinds. You’re either milk or wine. There’s no in the middle.""
PHILLIES' ZACK WHEELER MAKES MLB HISTORY WITH 3-YEAR CONTRACT EXTENSION
Castellanos, entering his 12th year in MLB, has aged like wine in his metaphor. It’ll be his third season with the Phillies, a team that desperately wants another crack at the World Series after losing to the Houston Astros two seasons ago and falling to the Arizona Diamondbacks in the NLCS in 2023.
Castellanos has performed well for Philly since joining the team in 2022. He’s predominantly played right field, with Bryce Harper transitioning to first base. And he made his first All-Star team with the squad last year, slashing .272/.311/.476 with 29 homers and 106 RBIs, a career-high.

But for all his solid hitting, Castellanos has also been known for some hilarious and infamous MLB moments.
There’s the Thom Brennaman broadcast where an on-air slur led to Brennaman's public apology and dismissal as the Cincinnati Reds play-by-play announcer. While Brennaman was making his apology, Castellanos hit a solo home run to left field, possibly the most poorly-timed home run in league history.
He also said at his second All-Star Game last year that his favorite superhero was Scooby-Doo, which led to tons of laughter on social media.
Castellanos likes to keep everyone on their toes and keep things fun. He’s a professional who still has a kid's mentality, and he’s gone viral for interactions with his son, 10-year-old Liam, on the field over the years.

Castellanos enters the third year of the five-year, $100 million contract he signed with Philadelphia after making his first All-Star team in 2021 with the Reds. He played seven seasons with the Detroit Tigers before being traded to the Chicago Cubs, where he played half a season in 2019.

One of the best promotions in all of Major League Baseball is coming to an end, and Philadelphia Phillies fans are not happy about it.
Dollar hot dog night at Citizens Bank Park in South Philadelphia has been a staple for 27 years as one of the best promotions in the majors.
But the Phillies announced Thursday they are ending the promotion.
The team is replacing it with a two-for-one deal at two April home games this season.

The official word is the decision was ""based on the organization’s ongoing commitment to provide a positive experience for all fans in attendance."" But the unofficial reason could be due to what happened last year on dollar dog nights.
A food fight erupted in the stands at the Bank during an April 11 game against the Miami Marlins. Fans were launching the dollar dogs at one another and some landed on the field. Multiple fans were ejected in several sections throughout the park.JOSÉ DELEÓN, MLB VETERAN PITCHER WHO LED NL IN STRIKEOUTS IN 1989, DEAD AT 63
""It wasn’t just the throwing,"" John Weber, senior vice president, Phillies ticket operations and projects, told The Associated Press. ""It’s the concourse, the crowds of everybody being at the same X amount of stands. But, obviously, you know, the throwing was a little bit of a tipping point.""
Weber added that the promotion was always designed to be a ""more family-orientated"" deal, which started when the Phillies played at Veterans Stadium. The promotion, offered weekdays early in the season during April and May, was intended to draw more fans.
The Phillies also didn’t have as much success then as they do now, making it to the World Series two seasons ago and reaching the National League Championship Series in 2023.

Phillies fans will have to settle for the two-for-one deals April 2 against the Cincinnati Reds and April 16 against the Colorado Rockies.
Fans are already ripping the decision on social media.
As for other teams across the league, the Texas Rangers host dollar dog nights at every Wednesday home game at Globe Life Field. The Minnesota Twins do the same for every Tuesday home game.

The Chicago Bears were second in the NFL in rushing yards per game during the 2023 season, and on Monday, the team appeared to add another weapon to their running game.

Chicago finished 7-10 last season but saw three players rush for at least 400 yards – quarterback Justin Fields and running backs Khalil Herbert and D’Onta Foreman. Roschon Johnson also added 352 yards on the ground. The team averaged 141.1 yards per game – second to the Baltimore Ravens’ 156.5 yards per game average.
Swift has been a valuable running back since he entered the NFL in 2020.

The former Georgia standout played three seasons for the Detroit Lions before he was the odd man out of their running back corps. He ran for 1,680 yards and 18 touchdowns in 40 games for Detroit.
He really came into his own during his lone season with the Philadelphia Eagles. In 2023, he ran for a career-high 1,049 yards and five touchdowns. He also had 39 catches for 214 yards and a score. He was named to the Pro Bowl for the first time in his career.
Swift will now be on a Chicago team hungry to get back to the top of the NFC North. The Bears have the No. 1 pick in this year’s draft after last year’s trade with the Carolina Panthers.

Audrey Jimenez, an 18-year-old from Sunnyside High School in Tucson, won the Division 1 title in the 106-pound weight class.

In a video posted to X of her match, you can see Jimenez is sort of in shock that she won the title, while the crowd is roaring in celebration as the referee raised her arm to signify the victory.
Now, Jimenez is used to winning state titles in her high school career, but it always came against girls. For the past three years, she’s been required to compete against girls despite facing boys during the regular season.
This year, however, her coaches asked the Arizona Interscholastic Association to allow Jimenez to compete against boys in the state tournament, which was granted.
Scripps News Phoenix adds that Jimenez’ parents, her father Billy and mother Denise, have always spoken highly of their daughter’s work ethic.

When the AIA gave her the ability to compete against boys in the state tournament, they both knew she would make the best of her opportunity.
""Once you see it done, you know it’s possible,"" Jimenez said.
Jimenez won the match, 7-5, after being down 4-2 early on. She beat four male wrestlers, including her championship match opponent, to win the title.

New Orleans Pelicans star Zion Williamson was the top overall draft pick in 2019. The 23-year-old forward has been named to two NBA All-Star teams, despite dealing with injuries for the majority of his professional basketball career.
Williamson was mostly healthy during the 2020-21 season, when he appeared in 61 games. He averaged 27 points and 7.2 rebounds per contest. He earned All-Star honors for his performance that season. He has also been mostly available this season, appearing in 51 of the Pelicans' games so far.
Despite averaging 22.1 points and 5.1 assists this season, Williamson was not an All-Star selection. The NBA recently implemented rules that require players to play a minimum number of games in order to qualify for major awards such as MVP. But, it appears Zion has his sights set on being named to the All-Star team for a third time in his career.

Riddle made an appearance on ""The MMA Hour,"" where he was frank with host Ariel Helwani on the situation while with WWE.
""I went to the strip club and did cocaine a couple times,"" he said. ""I failed a drug test for that. … That was for all of them, it was cocaine each time. But it was honestly just random nights.""

Riddle added that the first drug test was a random one administered by the WWE.
""Sometimes you get tested at the end of one month and the beginning of another month,"" he explained. ""So, there was one week where I failed, bang bang, didn’t know I failed the second one, and by the time I failed the first one, I got two right at once. So, I think that’s why they were a little more lenient with me.""
After getting notice that he had failed back-to-back tests, Riddle said he told WWE officials he would be better – until he wasn’t.
""I was like, ‘OK guys, I’m going to show you, no more problems,’"" Riddle said. ""’Hey, you guys can test me for the next 10 weeks.’ And I did that, I was fine, didn’t fail one test, didn’t do anything.""
""When I thought I was in the clear, went out and partied a little bit, they gave me a random test at my house. I failed that, and shortly after that, they had me go to rehab.""
WWE LEGEND VIRGIL DEAD AT 61
This wasn’t the only controversy Riddle, who fought in UFC and is currently signed with Major League Wrestling (MLW), dealt with while in WWE.
In the summer of 2020, Riddle was accused of sexually assaulting a female wrestler, Candy Cartwright. She alleged the incident occurred after an independent show in May 2018, where Riddle asked Cartwright to have sex with him, and after she declined, he choked her and forced her to give him oral sex.
There was also an incident at JFK Airport in September 2023, where Riddle was ""acting disruptive"" as he transferred flights during a return from India. He admitted on the podcast that he had a ""couple of cocktails"" and took the airline microphone during a delayed flight and caused a ruckus.
Riddle also said a Port Authority police officer sexually assaulted him when they showed up to stop him from speaking into the microphone, posting a photo of the officer on his Instagram account in September 2023.

""Nothing like being sexually assaulted and harassed at the jfk airport, no means no and just because I’m nice doesn’t mean yes!!! A—hole!!!"" he wrote in the caption.
""I talked to internal affairs, I talked to the FBI,"" he said to Helwani about the incident. ""I’m not in trouble, I can assure you that. I’m not going to go into details with the situation because they asked me not to, unless I want to press charges, and I didn’t want to press charges. But that’s how that situation was handled.""
Riddle later filed a restraining order against Cartwright, saying he was harassed and stalked by her in person and over the Internet. He would later withdraw the restraining order in September 2020.
When the WWE released him, Riddle didn’t think this out-of-the-ring incident was the reason.
""I don’t think it helped – especially with the UFC merging,"" he said. ""And I was going to probably be making, well, it was written in my contract that I was going to make a million dollars this upcoming year guaranteed, which was a lot more than I was making last year and a lot more than I was making the year before that. So, I think there was multiple variables that played into my departure. Plus, I failed a couple of drug tests.""
Riddle told Helwani he was in rehab for 30 days and was told to do another 30 days, which he agreed to. Riddle says he learned his lesson and won’t ""go out and rage it up any more like that.""
Riddle, a black belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, owns a 13-8 UFC record, which came from 2008 to 2013. He wrestled in WWE from 2018 to 2023, announcing his departure in late September last year.

Tiki Barber’s comments about Saquon Barkley’s decision to join the Philadelphia Eagles in free agency were as powerful as the news itself Monday, the first day of the league’s tampering period.

""This is an opportunity for us to continue to gather information, learn about the different players in the draft, listen to what opportunities could come up, and then at the end of the day we’re going to make the best decision that we can for the Chicago Bears.""
He continued, ""It will not be based on fear of what could happen with this, and what could happen with that – we’re going to out our information together and make the best decision, because at the end of the day, we’ll always throw our decision making against our core deal which is win championships and sustain success for a long period of time.""

When asked specifically about the Bears’ plans if they do draft a quarterback, Poles vowed to ""do right"" by Fields.
JUSTIN FIELDS GIVES INTERESTING ANSWER TO WHY HE UNFOLLOWED BEARS ON INSTAGRAM
""It just depends on what opportunities pop up,"" he began. ""If we go down that road, I want to do right by Justin as well. No one wants to live in gray. I know that’s uncomfortable. I wouldn’t want to be in that situation either, so we’ll gather information, we’ll move as quickly as possible – we’re not going to be in a rush, and see what presents itself and what’s best for the organization.""
The Bears have missed the playoffs in each of Fields' first three seasons and have had no postseason wins since the 2010 season. They have several routes they could go, including trading the No. 1 pick or using it to take USC standout Caleb Williams.

All signs point to veteran quarterback Russell Wilson leaving the Denver Broncos at some point before the start of the 2024 season. The upcoming NFL scouting combine and draft have seemed to only increase the speculation surrounding Wilson's future.
While a decision on Wilson remains unknown, one former NFL star claims to already know where the Super Bowl-winning quarterback will land, as Chad ""Ochocinco"" Johnson expressed his strong belief that Wilson will play for the Pittsburgh Steelers next season.
""A little birdie told me… and I said this many shows ago… Russell Wilson's coming on over there to the Steelers,"" Johnson told Shannon Sharpe on the ""Nightcap"" podcast.

""No,"" Johnson insisted. ""(Fields is) going to Atlanta. I told you. I got the script.""

Wilson's departure from the Broncos, however, may not be as imminent as some might expect, at least according to some comments from head coach Sean Payton. Earlier this year, Payton stopped short of ruling out the idea that the veteran quarterback could be back in Denver next season.
""That final decision has not been made,"" he told reporters in January.
Payton's comments came less than two weeks after reports surfaced that Wilson would be benched for the team's final two regular-season games.
Shortly after the benching was made public, Wilson revealed the Broncos approached him during the team's bye week and informed him that he would be benched unless he reworked his contract.

According to Wilson, the conversation revolved around the guarantee against injury in the five-year, $245 million contract he signed last year.
The contract kicks in next season. The Broncos could designate Wilson as a post-June 1 release to minimize the immediate negative impact on the team's salary cap.

""If you're 6-8, don't push somebody that little. That was uncalled for in my opinion. Let those two girls who were jawing, let them go at it.""
Mulkey doubled down on her reaction in a separate radio appearance on Tuesday.
""I am what I am,"" Mulkey said, via NOLA.com. ""I have no ill intentions. I have no agenda. I speak from my heart. I speak from my life experiences. And people like it or don’t like it. I have nothing, nothing whatsoever in my heart to harm anybody, but I fight like hell. That’s who I am.""

Dak Prescott stepped in for an injured Tony Romo during his rookie season in 2016 and helped guide the Dallas Cowboys to an eight-game winning streak, cementing himself as the team's starting quarterback.
Prescott's eight years as a starting NFL quarterback have been productive, especially in the regular season. The 30-year-old is about to enter the final year of his contract, which carries an estimated $59 million salary cap hit in 2024.
Prescott's future in Dallas has been widely discussed in recent weeks, with some speculating the Cowboys may go in a different direction at quarterback.
Cowboys quarterback legend and three-time Super Bowl winner Troy Aikman weighed in on the topic and expressed optimism about Prescott's long-term future in Dallas.

Aikman added that Prescott has shown he can produce in the NFL and has a bright future.

Earlier this year, longtime Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said the franchise was ""all in"" on Prescott.
""I would anticipate, with looking ahead at our key contracts that we'd like to address, we will be all in,"" Jones said at this year's Senior Bowl in Mobile, Alabama. If the Cowboys and Prescott's representatives can reach an agreement on a contract extension, it would presumably reduce his hefty cap hit for the 2024 season.

Prescott finished the 2024 season with 4,516 passing yards, the second-highest total of his career. His touchdown-to-interception ratio also improved last year. He threw for 36 touchdowns against nine interceptions after throwing 15 interceptions in 12 regular-season games in 2022.
The Cowboys have finished with 12 wins three consecutive years but have struggled in the postseason. The Packers upset Dallas in the wild-card round in January.
Aikman's recent comments are just the latest in a string of compliments the legendary Cowboys player has directed toward Prescott.

""I still believe in Dak,"" Aikman said in January, shortly after the disappointing playoff loss to Green Bay. ""I feel like until you do it, there are always those criticisms. Peyton Manning heard that his first three years — he didn't win a playoff game — and then you look back at it now, and you can't imagine anybody would question whether or not he could win a playoff game.""
Prescott has also recently expressed confidence he and the franchise will come to an agreement on a contract extension.

Former NFL wide receiver Antonio Brown is back in the news for all the wrong reasons.
This time, Brown is refusing to pay a celebrity jeweler $1 million for finger ""covers"" he had made despite Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Kerry Bensinger ordering him to do so.
Judge Bensinger ordered Brown to pay $1,095,000 to Shuki International, which is run by Jean Louis Shuki.

Shuki told The New York Post that Brown has been blowing off messages to pay up since last month. He, instead, is responding with the likes of ""U caint [sic] get s--- cracker"" and ""Stop call me u b----.""
""He’s a fanatic for the fingers,"" Shuki tells The Post. ""At this point, I don’t want the judgment, I just want the fingers back. They’re like the Mona Lisa.""
FORMER NFL STAR ANTONIO BROWN ARRESTED ON WARRANT PERTAINING TO ALLEGED UNPAID CHILD SUPPORT
Shuki has helped numerous high-end clients with their diamond endeavors, including Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Kim Kardashian.
He and Brown used to be good friends. The latter, who has become a rapper since he ended his NFL days, made a song entitled ""Shuki Diamonds"" last year. Shuki believes they can continue to do business together.
""I still love and believe in this guy,"" he explained. ""I think we can do big business together. He has lots of talent and is legendary – but he also likes to create drama.""

Brown is not short of drama, whether it was on the field during his days with the Pittsburgh Steelers or New England Patriots or, most infamously, leaving in the middle of a game for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Brown tore off his jersey and pads on the Bucs’ sideline at MetLife Stadium during a game against the New York Jets and saluted the crowd before running off into the locker room.
Since then, Brown has been caught up in multiple legal battles, including a situation involving another accessory. Brown was ordered to pay Secure the Bag Entertainment owner Ryan Kane $204,672 after he allegedly sold him a fake Richard Mille watch for $160,000. Kane’s lawyer, Mason Wolfe, also tells The Post he hasn’t paid up on that either.
Brown and Kane are dealing with another lawsuit in Florida as well, with Brown being accused of breach of contract and defamation over an ""exclusive artist agreement"" he signed with Secure the Bag Entertainment.

Former Atlanta Falcons star Roddy White took a shot at his former counterpart Sean Payton on Wednesday after the Denver Broncos let go of Russell Wilson and traded Jerry Jeudy.
Wilson was cut after playing 15 games in Payton’s offense and recording 3,070 passing yards and 26 touchdown passes. Jeudy had 54 catches for 758 yards and two touchdowns in 16 games. Payton led the Broncos to an 8-9 record in his first season at the helm in Denver but big changes were made.

White, who went up against the Payton-led New Orleans Saints during his career in Atlanta, wrote on X that Drew Brees was the one who carried the team, not Payton.
""Sean (Payton’s) time has passed him by don’t matter who he gets in the draft Drew carried that man and he ain’t done nothing since,"" he wrote on X.
""I don’t want people to think that cause he coached the Saints and I was a Falcons player that’s why I’m saying what I’m saying,"" he added. ""I just watched the games cause I’m a fan. Your job as a coach is to put the players in the best position to make plays and he didn’t do that.""

White also commended the Broncos’ 2023 roster.

""Man yelling at Russ like his resume is better than Russ’s last time I checked Russ went to 2 Super Bowl not one. Russ winning percentage better.""
The Broncos managed to beat the Kansas City Chiefs once during the 2023 season. But the AFC West didn’t get any easier.

University of Alabama athletics director Greg Byrne offered a different approach for schools whose teams storm the court or field after a big upset — go after their win/loss record.
On the heels of Duke star Kyle Filipowski tweaking his ankle as Wake Forest fans stormed the court after the win over the weekend, Byrne suggested Monday that forfeits could be the way to stop the action.

""Kids aren’t going to be in the stands saying, ‘Oh, I don’t want to do this because the school is gonna get fined $200,000,’"" Byrne said at the Birmingham Tip Off Club, via AL.com. ""That doesn’t enter their mindset. But if they knew the game that they just had been a part of, celebrated a great win that led to that, if they knew that they were going to lose that game immediately, that would stop them.""
Byrne pointed to an incident in which one of the school’s student managers thought they were going to ""lose an eye"" after being injured in a court-storming.
He said something further needed to be done.

The SEC has rules if fans from schools storm the court. A first-time offense is a $100,000 fine. The second time is a $250,000. A third time comes with a half-million-dollar penalty.
ACC Commissioner Jim Phillips addressed Saturday’s incident after the Duke-Wake Forest game.
""Across college athletics, we have seen far too many of these incidents that put individuals at serious risk, and it will require the cooperation of all — including spectators — to ensure everyone's well-being,"" Phillips said in a statement.

Max Verstappen’s dad offered a warning about the future of Red Bull Racing as team principal Christian Horner's controversy over allegations of misconduct toward a team employee engulfed Formula One before the start of the season.
Jos Verstappen, a former F1 star himself, told The Daily Mail the Red Bull team will ""explode"" if Horner continues as principal.
""There is tension here while he remains in position,"" he told the U.K.-based newspaper. ""The team is in danger of being torn apart. It can't go on the way it is. It will explode. He is playing the victim, when he is the one causing the problems.""

Max Verstappen won Saturday’s Bahrain Grand Prix to start the season where he left off in 2023. As the 2024 season should have been welcomed with excitement, the controversy at Red Bull was the talk of the track.
The team’s parent company dismissed a complaint of alleged misconduct by Horner toward a team employee on Wednesday.
However, on Thursday during a practice for the race, a file alleged to contain evidence against Horner, including text messages, was emailed to nearly 200 people in the F1 paddock, including Liberty Media, F1, the FIA, team principals and media outlets, according to The Associated Press.
Jos Verstappen was accused of leaking the file, but he denied it.

Horner has maintained his innocence.
""I won’t comment on anonymous speculation, but to reiterate, I have always denied the allegations,"" according to a statement read to journalists by a team spokesman Thursday, which was attributed to Horner.
""I respected the integrity of the independent investigation and fully cooperated with it every step of the way. ""It was a thorough and fair investigation conducted by an independent specialist barrister and it has concluded, dismissing the complaint made. I remain fully focused on the start of the season.""
FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem told the Financial Times that the controversy around Horner was ""damaging the sport"" but the FIA wouldn’t conduct its own inquiry unless a complaint is lodged.
He said any complaint filed with its compliance office would be investigated, but it has not received one.

A man accused of attacking an elderly gym patron in Farmington Hills, Michigan — where ex-NFL and Michigan football star Braylon Edwards intervened to save the gym-goer's life — was charged.
Malik Ali Smith, 20, is being charged with assault with intent to murder, carrying a maximum sentence of life in prison if convicted, Fox 2 Detroit reported.
Smith attacked the 80-year-old man after an exchange of words inside the locker room at Farming Hills YMCA around 10:45 a.m. on March 1. Edwards, a Michigan Wolverines legend who was drafted third overall by the Cleveland Browns in 2005, overheard the commotion caused after the verbal tussle and stepped in just in time.

""I walk into the locker room after work, and basically, I hear about four rows behind me arguing about music and how it was being played too loud,"" Edwards explained. ""So, I’m not paying attention, and I was just minding my business.
""The noise escalates, and then you can hear some pushing and shoving, so you know what fighting sounds like, but once I hear a thud, that’s when I got up and turned around.""
BRAYLON EDWARDS, EX-NFL AND MICHIGAN STAR, SAVES 80-YEAR-OLD MAN'S LIFE DURING LOCKER ROOM ATTACK
Edwards revealed to WDIV-TV that authorities found out, if he didn’t step in, the elderly man may have died. He is currently in the hospital in critical condition.
""I see the guy for what I was thinking was reaching for a phone underneath the victim, grabs the back of the victim’s head by the hair, and he was about to slam it down on the counter,"" Edwards said.

Smith allegedly fled the YMCA, but police were able to arrest him nearby. They made note of the Good Samaritan in Edwards.
""This was a vicious, senseless attack,"" Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald said, via Fox 2 Detroit. ""I commend the witness who intervened, and we will seek justice for this victim.""

The NASCAR Cup Series world will shift its focus to Georgia on Sunday as the 2024 season moves from the Daytona International Speedway to Atlanta Motor Speedway for the Ambetter Health 400.
The Cup Series race will mark the end of the trifecta in Hampton, Georgia. The Craftsman Truck Series kicked off the weekend with the Fr8 208 on Saturday, which was followed by the Xfinity Series’ RAPTOR King of Tough 250.
William Byron will enter the race looking to do something not seen since Matt Kenseth accomplished it in 2009 – win the first two races of the regular season. Byron eked out a win against Hendrick Motorsports teammate Alex Bowman as the Daytona 500 ended with a caution as the pack received the white flag.

Byron celebrated the win with a trip to the top of the Empire State Building earlier in the week.
He guided the No. 24 Chevrolet to Victory Lane at the Quaker State 400 in Atlanta in July last year. Over his last 37 regular-season races, Byron has won seven times. The eyes of the racing world will be on him Sunday afternoon.
The pressure will mostly be off Byron as he has the inside track into the NASCAR Cup Series playoffs now, but the spotlight will shine on a few drivers who finished toward the end of the Daytona race.
Ten drivers did not finish the race at Daytona because of accidents, including Harrison Burton, Austin Dillon, Joey Logano and defending NASCAR champion Ryan Blaney. Logano won the Ambetter Health 400 in March last year.

The Daytona 500 was pushed to Monday due to the storms that passed through the Sunshine State. This time, Fox Weather says Hampton is set to experience sunshine and 63-degree weather for the event.
Richard Petty, Dale Earnhardt, Bobby Labonte and Jimmie Johnson each are tied for the most wins in the Ambetter Health 400 with four. Brad Keselowski is the only other active driver with multiple wins in the race with two.
The track has been a quad-oval since 1997. It is 1.540 miles in length. The turns have 28-degree banking, and the straightaways have 5-degree banking.

McAfee and Smith were in the midst of a private conversation when the incident occurred, the New York Post reported. The alleged argument was so intense it led to Smith banning McAfee from making appearances on ""First Take"" during the football season, according to the report.
McAfee reportedly called Smith a ""motherf---er"" during the spat.

The Iowa Hawkeyes women’s basketball team are Big Ten Tournament champions for the third straight season, but the Nebraska Cornhuskers did not make things easy on Sunday afternoon.
All eyes were, of course, on Caitlin Clark’s performance in yet another championship game for the conference, especially considering she was named Most Outstanding Player the past two years.
But Clark had a slow start in this game, going 0-for-9 from three-point territory as Nebraska won the first quarter, 23-17, and went into halftime leading 46-35.

However, a strong second half from the Hawkeyes got them right back in the game. They tied it up by the end of the third quarter, and after going back and forth in the fourth quarter, this game needed to go to overtime.
Kate Martin played a big role in overtime, assisting on the first basket to Hannah Stuelke to make it 79-77. Then she drained a three-pointer to start pulling away.
But again, Nebraska’s relentless effort made things tough for Iowa. Alexis Marokowski and Natalie Potts both made layups to cut Iowa’s lead to one, and Nebraska retook their lead when Logan Nissley hit a three-pointer of her own, making it 84-82.

Martin, though, came right back down the court and drained a three to get the momentum back to the Hawkeyes. Then Clark came through.
With 1:11 left to play in overtime, Nissley again drained a three, but Clark responded with one of her own to keep the Hawkeyes’ lead at 89-87 with less than a minute to play. Clark then forced a turnover with a steal on Jaz Shelley, and hit two free throws once she was fouled.
After Nissley missed a three with 31 seconds left to play, the Hawkeyes continued to play good defense and hit late free throws to win 94-89.

Clark finished the game 12 of 29 from the floor, though a poor 5-for-17 from beyond the arc, for 34 points, which included 5 of 6 made free throws. She also had a double-double with 12 assists and seven rebounds, while collecting three steals on the day.
Stuelke provided 25 points and nine rebounds for the Hawkeyes, while Sydney Affolter had a double-double with 11 points and 11 rebounds.
With the Big Ten title in hand, the Hawkeyes – ranked No. 3 in the country – should be receiving a No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament. Selection Sunday next week will solidify their position and their opponent to begin March Madness.
Clark will obviously play a large factor in the Hawkeyes returning to the national championship game, where they fell last season to the LSU Tigers.

"February 24, 2024 6:00am EST",Recent MLB uniform change compares to this classic 'Seinfeld' scene,Fox News,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
A classic pop culture moment is being played out in the MLB.
The comedic moment in question is from the sitcom ""Seinfeld."" In the show, while George Costanza (Jason Alexander) is working for the New York Yankees, he pushes to switch the team's polyester jerseys to cotton. The switch starts off as a good call but quickly goes downhill.
The mixed reviews of the new MLB jerseys have brought in mixed reviews. This jersey swap by the MLB is comparable to the classic call made by Costanza.

In the show, Costanza is in the locker room with one of the players, who mentions that he gets really hot in his jersey. After a quick look at the tag, Costanza determines that the jerseys are made of polyester and identifies the material as the source of the sweating.
Costanza makes it his mission to get the jerseys switched from polyester to cotton, for a more breathable feel. The character is successful in his endeavors, and the Yankees take the field in their brand-new uniforms.
During the first game with the new uniforms on full display, people quickly notice the change, with the announcers explaining that the team switched from polyester to cotton uniforms.
After their first game in the new attire, players rave in the papers about their new jerseys and how the more breathable fabric contributed to their great performance on the field.
‘FRIENDS’, ‘SEINFELD’ AND OTHER TV SHOWS UNFIT FOR TODAY'S WOKE CULTURE
Unfortunately, Costanza does not have long to bask in the glory of his jersey swap success. While he and Jerry Seinfeld tune in to the next game on TV, the announcers talk about how the Yankees cannot run like they usually do because the uniforms have shrunk, making them too tight for the players, even causing one to split his pants.
While the new MLB jerseys have not caused any shrinkage or pants splitting, there are a lot of mixed reviews from players, some loving the new feel, just like the Yankees did in ""Seinfeld,"" while others have noted that they do not love their new look.

A first look at Nike's new on-field Vapor Premier uniforms for the 2024 season came with the start of spring training, where players wore their new attire.
One of the biggest gripes players have with the new uniforms is their last names being smaller on the back of the jerseys than before, and being able to see the tucked in jersey through the pants.
HISTORY OF THE MLB: FROM EARLY BASEBALL BEGINNINGS TO MONUMENTAL MOMENTS
Pitchers Rich Hill and Miles Mikolas have both described the new uniforms as ""cheap.""
""It looks like a replica,"" Los Angeles Angels outfielder Taylor Ward said, per The Athletic. ""It feels kind of like papery. It could be great when you’re out there sweating, it may be breathable. But I haven’t had that opportunity yet to try that out. But from the looks of it, it doesn’t look like a $450 jersey.""
MLB executives have maintained unwavering support for the new jerseys, ensuring players and fans that these uniforms are top-notch.
""In acquiring Majestic and its MLB uniform manufacturing facilities in Easton, PA -- which have been making player uniforms for nearly two decades -- Fanatics has consistently produced world-class uniforms, including every Nike-branded MLB on-field jersey and all City Connect gear since 2020,"" Dennis Nolan, MLB senior vice president of global consumer products said, via MLB.com.

Stephen Roche, another global exec, has joined in on the jersey debate, noting that the respective color schemes match for the first time with the new jerseys.
""That was all part of the tightening up of the entire process,"" Roche said. ""Clubs were able to approve how everything matched Nike’s standard colors. For the first time, we had a uniform where all the colors matched exactly with the hats and the on-field colors. They had always been close, but they weren’t exact. Now they are.""
The MLB website highlights that these jerseys feature 25% more stretch than last year's and that the new design was tested by hundreds of players.

While there has been a fair amount of not-so positive reviews on the new jerseys, some have had good things to report.
""These new uniforms fit better and feel lighter,"" Ronald Acuña Jr. of the Atlanta Braves said in an official statement. ""I play fast and want to wear something that won’t pull when I’m running. Feeling free in the jersey is the best feeling in the world.""
""The Nike Vapor Premier jersey is soft, light and comfortable. It’s almost like wearing my favorite shirt out on the field – and so easy to move around in,"" St. Louis Cardinals third baseman Nolan Arenado said.
Kenley Jansen of the Boston Red Sox also gave the jersey good reviews, saying ""It feels more fit on your body and how light it is. It’s kind of like the NBA-type of jerseys.""
The uniforms are sure to cause even more buzz leading up to MLB Opening Day on March 28.

SPORTSBOOK REFUSING TO RETURN $20 MILLION STOLEN FROM JAGUARS BY FORMER TEAM EMPLOYE TO GAMBLE: REPORTS
Now, Fatukasi isn’t the first player to have been released on their birthday, specifically in the NFL.
The Cleveland Browns did the exact same thing with offensive lineman Michael Dunn just before the 2023 regular season got underway. Just hours after wishing him happy birthday on social media, it was announced the team was letting Dunn go.

The Green Bay Packers also released linebacker Jonathan Garvin last July on his birthday, and yes, they wished him a great one on social media as well.
Still, Fatukasi’s 29th birthday likely doesn’t feel so good now that he’ll be among free agents next week when the new league year begins on March 13.
The sixth-round draft pick by the New York Jets in 2018 has been with the Jags for the past two seasons, racking up 48 combined tackles (five for loss) and 1.5 sacks over 30 games (29 starts).
With the Jets, Fatukasi had 3.0 sacks, 115 tackles (18 for loss) and 14 quarterback hits over 45 games (23 starts).

New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft reportedly met with second gentleman Doug Emhoff and civil rights leader Clarence Jones to discuss antisemitism and ways to deter bias toward the Jewish and Black communities.
The group met in Massachusetts and also ""emphasized the urgent need to address antisemitic language and harassment,"" Bloomberg reported, citing a White House statement. Emhoff reportedly toured the Foundation to Combat Antisemitism and learned about how it monitors online hate speech.

Kraft’s foundation has been at the forefront of the fight against antisemitism — amplified further by the Oct. 7 Hamas terror attacks in Israel. The organization also had an ad during the Super Bowl.
""Antisemitism is a growing threat against Jews on social media and in communities across the country,"" Kraft says on the organization’s website. ""I have committed tremendous resources toward this effort and am vowing to do more. I encourage others to join in these efforts.
""My hope is our campaign will continue to enhance the national conversation about the need to speak out against hatred of all types, and particularly to stand up to Jewish hate.""
Emhoff, the husband of Vice President Kamala Harris, told officials at the World Economic Forum in January about the painful experiences American Jews have dealt with in the wake of the terror attacks.

PATRIOTS' ROBERT KRAFT EXPRESSES DISBELIEF OVER SUPPORT FOR HAMAS
He mentioned the ""aloneness"" that Jewish people in America have woken up to following Hamas’ attack. After noting that nothing is as sorrowful as what the victims of the brutal attack have endured, Emhoff said how difficult it has been for his community to see people take stances against Jews and Israel.
""Again, we’re not in Israel… so we can’t even imagine what that is like, but American Jews — I think the feeling is one of aloneness and being hated and being unmoored,"" he said.
Since the Oct. 7 killings by Hamas, emboldened pro-Palestinian supporters have flooded public spaces, Ivy League campuses, and taken to social media to denounce Israel’s treatment of Palestinians and its military campaign in Gaza.

San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Deebo Samuel is one of the best players in the NFL. He can run, catch, break tackles and seemingly score at will.
However, two Super Bowl losses at the hands of the Kansas City Chiefs is not something that is easy to swallow for him. He explained on ""Up & Adams"" that losing the Super Bowl again is ""heartbreaking,"" and trying to will his way back and help the team get there again is a lot easier said than done.

""People just say there’s always next year, but I heard that in 2019, and it took four more years to get where we’re at,"" Samuel said on the show. ""So, it’s not that easy as people think to get to the Super Bowl. It takes everything.
""It takes me, the coaches, the people upstairs, you bring people in to help. For everything to play out right, you’re not just gonna snap your hands and be back in the Super Bowl again.""

The 49ers have been one of the best teams in the league, and if it was not for Patrick Mahomes, San Francisco might have seven Super Bowl championships in their trophy case instead of five.
San Francisco has made the NFC Championship Game four out of the last five years. If it was not for a stream of injuries in 2020, they might have gone five-for-five. However, making two Super Bowls in five years is nothing to sneeze at in general.

As the college basketball regular season winds down, the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament comes into focus.
While UConn and other highly-ranked teams, such as Houston, Purdue and Arizona, appear to be virtual locks for this year's tournament, several other teams remain on the bubble. Coaches across the nation are likely trying to get players to remain laser-focused on the task at hand — making it into the tournament.
The teams that are on the cusp of making the tournament tend to dominate conversations in the sports world in the days leading up to the Selection Sunday announcements. The increased level of attention can add to the number of distractions athletes typically contend with as the tournament looms.
During a recent appearance on OutKick’s ""Don’t @ Me with Dan Dakich"" Oklahoma men's basketball coach Porter Moser discussed the challenge of getting players, especially those suiting up for teams on the bubble, to block out all the noise.

The tournament field is made up of 36 ""at-large"" teams. An NCAA selection committee selects those teams, which are scheduled to be announced on March 17. The 32 teams who win their respective Division I conferences round out the field of 68 teams.
Moser also spoke about how the Sooners battled through a daunting stretch of games against some of the best teams in the nation.

We had four games against top 12 teams, and a road game against your rival in the last bedlam series at Oklahoma State. We had Baylor, Kansas, at Oklahoma State, and then Iowa State, Houston…. So we won one of them.
""I think the guys knew we had to win it. We really kind of addressed it a little bit and went after it… and then, all of a sudden, the circumstances… losing our leading scorer right before the game.

The Texas Rangers are sorting through their pitching staff ahead of a highly anticipated opening day against the Chicago Cubs.
The 2023 World Series champions will host the Cubs in Arlington, Texas, March 28. Last year, the Rangers won the World Series for the first time in franchise history.
""We have some spots open. We have some, you know, good candidates for those spots, both on roster, and non-roster,"" Bruce Bochy, manager of the Rangers, told reporters Feb. 14, ahead of spring training.
Bochy's staff includes closers José Leclerc and David Robertson and relievers Josh Sborz and Kirby Yates, among others.

""They came on at the right time,"" Bochy said of Leclerc and Sborz, his high-leverage, late-inning guys in the 2023 season. ""Then, you know, you get into Robertson and Yates. With their experience, they’re gonna make our bullpen so much better.""
Robertson reached a one-year deal with the Rangers in late January with a mutual option for 2025.
""I’m ready,"" Robertson told reporters after a 4-2 loss to the Kansas City Royals March 8 in Surprise, Arizona.
The game was Robertson’s Cactus League debut with the Rangers, and he pitched an inning and gave up no runs.
""Let’s start the season. We can skip all the spring training games,"" Robertson said.
Robertson is preparing for a versatile role on the Rangers' roster and told reporters he will do what is asked of him, within reason.
Bochy said his starting rotation is not finalized, and he’s using camp to thin out his bullpen and possibly add another body to his starting lineup.

""September; it’s a tough schedule,"" he said. ""We got 17 consecutive games there. So, you know, we’re probably gonna need a sixth starter in there to give those guys a break, too, and have some multiple inning guys in that bullpen.""
Bochy is feeling good about his team ahead of opening day.
""I think we’re in a better position right now when you look at the bullpen,"" Bochy told reporters. In 2023, the Rangers started their season with a win on opening day, defeating the Philadelphia Phillies 11-7. ""I think we’re a little bit stronger than where we were last year.
""We have more options now,"" he said of his pitching staff. ""That’s a sigh of relief.""

Bochy did acknowledge some of his players are ""a little banged up,"" including three of his starting infielders who are not yet ready to play.
Attendance for the Rangers in 2023 was up nearly 26% from 2022, according to ESPN. This year, the season is slated to start the same way it did in 2023 with a packed house in Arlington and all 30 MLB teams playing on opening day. Before last year, this hadn’t been the case since 1968.
Game time for Rangers-Cubs is 7:35 p.m. ET March 28.

The Chicago Bears currently hold the top pick in next month's NFL Draft.
For almost two years, former USC quarterback Caleb Williams has been projected to be the first player taken once he decided to declare for the draft.
But, after the 2022 Heisman Trophy winner's production slightly dropped in 2023, more and more questions began to surface about whether he should be the first quarterback taken in this year's draft. Some have even argued about whether Williams' skillset would transfer to the NFL.
Ryan Leaf, the second overall pick in the 1998 draft, appears to be among those who have some doubts about Williams.

Leaf doesn't believe Caleb Williams should be a Day 1 starter for whatever NFL team that drafts him.
His comments about Williams came during the latest ""Dan Patrick Show"" when Dan Patrick started the conversation with a simple question: ""If the Bears take Caleb Williams...?""
That's when Leaf surprised the audience.
Leaf said that the majority of Williams’ skill set is not transferable without development.

""If you take him, you better be under the understanding that you're going to sit him this year — and that's not going to happen,"" Leaf said about the potential No. 1 pick.
""Seventy-five percent of what made him so great in college is not transferable to the NFL. He’s not going to be able to do that. He can’t do what he did in college 75% of the time and be successful at the NFL level,"" explained Leaf. ""He can do the 25% at the NFL level, but he needs some time.""
So what is the 75% of the game that he can't do right now?
Well, Leaf explained Williams doesn't play under center, doesn't play on time and learned to play the quarterback position from the pocket.
Leaf went on to say that the only two quarterbacks in the 2024 NFL Draft that he believes can start Day 1 are Jayden Daniels and Michael Penix Jr.

Barber previously revealed what he wanted to see from Barkley prior to his decision, hoping he'd sign anywhere else than Philly because he felt it would tarnished everything he's done in six seasons with the G-Men.
""The fact that Saquon would even contemplate going to play for that team in Philadelphia is insulting to his Giant history and legacy,"" Barber explained.

Also, articles were coming out mid-season that Barber was going to be retiring after the year. He also called out head coach Tom Coughlin.
The Giants would go on to win the Super Bowl the next season.
Barkley never found common ground with the Giants last offseason, when he eventually played on his franchise tag. It was reported earlier Monday that the Giants weren't among teams offering Barkley this time around, with the Chicago Bears and Houston Texans vying with the Eagles.
While Barkley took time to rip Barber, he also was retweeting his new teammate Darius Slay's welcoming X post, while also sharing photoshopped images of him in an Eagles uniform.

"March 13, 2024 4:30am EDT",Noah Lyles reflects on backlash he received for NBA 'world champions' comment,Fox News,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
After winning three gold medals at last year's world championships, Noah Lyles held the title of world champion.
After doing so, he suggested NBA players didn't have the right to call themselves world champions for winning the NBA Finals.
""I have to watch the NBA Finals, and they have world champion on their head. World champion of what?"" Lyles said at the time. ""The United States? Don’t get me wrong. I love the U.S. at times, but that ain’t the world. That is not the world.
""We are the world. We have almost every country out here fighting, thriving, putting on their flag to show they are represented. There ain’t no flags in the NBA. We gotta do more. We gotta be presented to the world.""

Almost immediately, NBA players clapped back. Kevin Durant said ""somebody"" needed to ""help this brother,"" while Utah Jazz forward Juan Toscano-Anderson noted ""the NBA was the best competition in the WORLD.""
Others supported Lyles, like Giannis Antetokounmpo and CJ McCollum, but the opposition was loud.
""When I first seen the comment, I’m at the club celebrating three gold medals. We’re walking out, all of a sudden, my phone’s blowing up, and my boy’s like, ‘You need to tell KD to shut up,’"" Lyles said in a recent interview with Fox News.
""I’m looking at my phone like, ‘What are you talking about?’ Wake up the next day, still talking about it. Get into the night, Drake is talking about it. I don’t know what Drake’s doing here, but, ‘Wow, this is getting somewhere.’""

US TRACK STAR NOAH LYLES SAYS REPRESENTING COUNTRY AT OLYMPICS IS ‘BITTERSWEET’
Lyles mentioned that Stephen A. Smith called him an ""idiot"" but apologized. He also made note that he feels most of the backlash has come from within the United States.
""It’s the U.S. vs. the world. And anybody that has lived in or is outside the U.S. agrees with my comments. Most of the people in the U.S. do not,"" he says.
Lyles said he was surprised at the backlash he received, but ""mainly because I’ve said that comment many times.""
""This was the time it actually picked up traction, which was never the actual goal,"" he said. ""The question was talking about how the sport views us in the U.S., and how does that feel. So, talking about it sucks, all that. Then, all the sudden, the example becomes the main thing.""

"March 13, 2024 8:56pm EDT","Chargers release Mike Williams to save $20M, get under NFL's salary cap",Fox News,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
The Los Angeles Chargers announced Wednesday they released veteran wide receiver Mike Williams to get below the salary cap for the 2024 season.
Williams’ release saves the Chargers $20 million in salary cap room, but Williams will still cost the franchise $12.46 million in dead cap space.
The move was a necessity for the Chargers because they had to get under the $255.4 million salary cap by 4 p.m. ET Wednesday, and Williams became a free agent.

Los Angeles, despite making headlines earlier this offseason by hiring Jim Harbaugh to become their new head coach, knew they had to make tough roster decisions because they were well over the salary cap.
They released veteran linebacker Eric Kendricks, who signed with the Dallas Cowboys Wednesday, and they let Austin Ekeler go to the Washington Commanders in free agency.
EX-NFL PLAYER SAYS HE WAS SEXUALLY ASSAULTED BY HIS HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETIC TRAINER
The Chargers were, however, able to renegotiate Khalil Mack’s contract for the 2024 season to create more cap room and keep him with the team. They also signed running back Gus Edwards, tight end Will Dissly and safety Alohi Gilman.
Williams was selected seventh overall by the Chargers in the 2017 NFL Draft and formed a top receiving tandem for years with Keenan Allen. Known for his contested catch ability, Williams had a breakout year in 2019, totaling 1,001 yards on just 49 receptions with two touchdowns. His 20.4 yards per catch led the NFL.

After putting up his best season in 2021 with 1,146 yards and nine touchdowns on 76 catches — all career highs — the Chargers rewarded him with a three-year deal worth $60 million before the start of the 2022 season.
But Williams’ production slid due to injuries. He fractured his back during the team’s regular-season finale in 2022, and he missed the team’s disappointing wild-card loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars. He only played 13 games that season before the injury.
In 2023, he got off to a hot start with 249 yards on 19 receptions with a touchdown in the first three weeks. But he tore his ACL, ending his season prematurely and creating questions about his future with the team heading into the offseason.

"March 7, 2024 5:30pm EST","NFL star Michael Thomas rips journalist over release report, accuses Saints of trying to ruin players' value",Fox News,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Michael Thomas has experienced his fair share of highs and lows throughout his eight-year NFL career. He received offensive player of the year honors following his standout 2019 season, but he has also faced multiple injury setbacks.
A foot injury forced him to finish the 2022 season on injured reserve, while another injury limited him to 10 games this past season. In January 2023, the Saints restructured the five-year, $96.3 million contract that the star wideout signed in 2019. The restructured deal allowed the Saints to have some short-term salary cap flexibility.
Thomas then agreed to a new one-year extension last March. The incentive-laden deal was worth up to $15 million, with $6.3 million guaranteed at signing per data from Over the Cap.

On Thursday, The Times-Picayune columnist Jeff Duncan reported that the Saints plan to release the veteran wide receiver next week, coinciding with the start of the NFL's new league year. Releasing Thomas this offseason will likely save New Orleans just over $1 million against the team's 2024 cap.
SAINTS' JUWAN JOHNSON HOPES TO BUILD CHEMISTRY WITH DEREK CARR AFTER TEAM'S RECENT QB WOES
Thomas took issue with the report and took to social media to dispute how his pending release was characterized. Thomas took aim at Duncan in a series of inflammatory posts on X, the company formerly known as Twitter, and suggested his upcoming separation was simply the result of his expiring contract.
""How they planning on releasing me if I was on a 1 year deal,"" Thomas wrote in one of the posts.
Thomas also accused Duncan of attempting to ""ruin players value.""
""The Saints leak information to him to try to ruin players value but see I’m not broke so I can speak on it,"" Thomas said.
The Saints had no comment when asked by Fox News Digital about Thomas' post.

The Saints selected Thomas in the second round of the 2016 NFL Draft. He finished his rookie campaign with 1,137 receiving yards and nine touchdowns.
Thomas became one of the most reliable possession receivers in the league, and he ended each of his first four seasons with at least 1,000 receiving yards. Thomas' last four years have been particularly injury-riddled, with the wideout appearing in 20 games over the past four seasons.

Elsewhere, on the Saints roster, offensive lineman Ryan Ramczyk inked a five-year, $96 million deal with the team in 2021. His $19.2 million average salary per year ranked eighth among all offensive linemen in the NFL last season. After uneven quarterback play from Jameis Winston and Andy Dalton during the 2022 season, the Saints opted to sign Derek Carr to a massive four-year contract last March.
At the time of the signing, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported that Carr's contract was worth $150 million with $100 million in total guarantees. Carr started all 17 games in 2023, finishing the season with 25 touchdowns against eight interceptions.

""Are we just fire bombing the whole team here or what? I usually don’t comment on these kinds of things but it’s just becoming slow torture at this point.""
Carolina received a second- and fifth-round draft pick in the deal with the Giants for Burns, according to NFL Network.

For McCaffrey, the Panthers traded the star running back to the San Francisco 49ers for second-, third- and fourth-round draft picks. That deal was completed in the middle of the 2022 season. McCaffrey has since been one of the best all-round offensive players in the NFL.
Carolina traded its 2024 first-round pick to the Chicago Bears last season to acquire the 2023 No. 1 overall pick. The team selected Bryce Young with the pick. But the Panthers ended up with the worst record last season and the Bears have the top pick this year.

Minnesota Timberwolves big man Rudy Gobert has been slapped with a big fine from the NBA after insinuating to officials that he believed they had a sports bet on the game against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Friday night.
With less than 30 seconds left in a tight game, where the Timberwolves led the Cavs 97-96, Gobert was called for a foul, which was his sixth of the night. Gobert fouled out of the game, and he did not like Scott Foster’s call.
As he was walking off the court, Gobert rubbed his fingers together, suggesting money was on the game by the referees.

The demonstration was something the league did not like, and now it goes beyond the technical foul Gobert was assessed. The league announced Gobert was fined $100,000 for making the gesture.
""The fine takes into account Gobert’s past instances of conduct detrimental to the NBA with regard to publicly criticizing the officiating,"" NBA executive vice president and head of basketball operations Joe Dumars said.
The worst part was the technical foul ultimately led the Cavs to tie the game, and Cleveland ended up winning, 113-104.

Gobert spoke to reporters postgame, and he doubled down on his belief that betting is destructive to the game.
""I’ll bite the bullet again,"" Gobert said on Friday. ""I’ll be the bad guy. I’ll take the fine, but I think it’s hurting our game. I know the betting and all that is becoming bigger and bigger, but it shouldn’t feel that way.

""My reaction, which I think was the truth, but it wasn’t the time to react that way. It cost my team the game. It was an immature reaction. It’s not just one call. Everyone makes mistakes, but when it’s over and over and over again, of course it’s frustrating.""
Micah Nori, who was filling in for Chris Finch as acting head coach, did not like Gobert’s actions in the moment.
""A technical foul with 27 seconds in the game, to be honest, is unacceptable,"" said Timberwolves assistant head coach Micah Nori, who was filling in for an ill Chris Finch. ""That’s who Rudy is, but you’ve got to be smart. He made a visual that was automatic. He was obviously frustrated — both teams were — but we have to be smarter.""
Gobert, the front-runner for NBA Defensive Player of the Year, left the game with seven points and 17 rebounds for the No. 2 team in the Western Conference.

NFL MVP quarterback Cam Newton went viral on Sunday after footage surfaced on social media of a brawl that broke out during a 7-on-7 football tournament in Atlanta.
Two of the men involved in the altercation, coaches TJ and Steph Brown, say Newton's actions throughout the weekend ultimately led to the physical skirmish that started with him grabbing Steph first before TJ threw a punch.
""It just should never have gotten to that,"" TJ told Fox News Digital on Monday.

Unfortunately, the situation was one that TJ and Steph, who run TopShelf Performance's (TSP) 7-on-7 teams while providing training for wide receivers at all levels, saw festering not just this weekend, but for quite some time.
They have had a relationship with Newton, the first overall pick in the 2011 NFL Draft who won league MVP with the Carolina Panthers in 2015, since 2020, when Newton appointed TJ head coach of one of his ""C1N"" 7-on-7 teams. Steph eventually came into the fold after coaching college ball, becoming Newton's wide receivers coach and a member of his offensive support staff.
Tensions rose within the organization, specifically when TJ's team was beating the team Newton coached. In 2022, TJ and Steph decided to break off from C1N and create their own 7-on-7 team, which became TSP.
NFL MVP CAM NEWTON APPEARS TO GET INTO FIGHT AT 7-ON-7 FOOTBALL GAME
The inaugural ""We Ball Sports"" 7-on-7 tournament took place in Atlanta over the weekend, when both organizations had teams playing, and TJ felt the organizers knew exactly what they were doing when they pitted their 18U teams against each other on Saturday.
""First off, on the organizer’s part, we weren’t even supposed to be playing Cam. They were on the whole other side of the bracket,"" TJ said.
TJ and Steph recalled taunting beginning from Newton's side prior to the game even starting. It was nothing new for teams to share some barbs before going at it on the field, no matter the sport. However, they felt it was personal.
""As we’re warming up, you see in most of the videos, Cam has this chant where he’s like, ‘Ayo!’ So he yells it over on his sideline, then he tells them, ‘Man, y’all go over there and do it to them too,'"" TJ explained. ""So all the players run up on us, and they’re like, ‘Ayo!’ Mind you, he knows a lot of our players don’t mess with his players, and some of them are cool. Obviously, as they’re running up on our players, the We Ball [Sports] folks, they’re recording it. All I said to the camera was, ‘Don’t delete the film when I beat him this time,’ because the last time I beat him – the last three times I beat them – all of a sudden there’s no film. ‘Oh, we didn’t record anything. We took pictures.’""
Football coach Steph Brown was involved in an altercation with former NFL MVP Cam Newton during a 7-on-7 football tournament. (Steph Brown)
TSP ended up beating C1N on Saturday, but Sunday is when things started to get even worse, beginning with an interaction TJ said he had with Newton in the parking lot.
""Sunday comes, I’m walking through the parking lot, walking to the field,"" he recounted. ""Cam jumps out of his car and yells, ‘Hey, all that sorry s--- ain’t gonna work today. What we betting today? What we betting?’ I’m like, ‘I ain’t betting you, bro. I already beat you three, four times. You got to beat me first.’ He like, ‘What we betting? I got plenty of money. I ain’t ever running out of money.’ That’s when I told him, ‘That’s your problem. All you care about is money. You think money is everything. You can’t buy me.’ And I walk off.""
Newton's team began to play in Sunday's slate of games, and TJ noted that he was taunting TSP despite not being opponents in the game. Then, when it was TSP's turn to start playing, Newton was at the top of a flight of stairs (seen in videos of the fight) hurling taunts down at the TSP coaches and players on the field.
""It’s probably three minutes into the game, he’s sitting up top with all his kids around him under a tent yelling down on us,"" TJ said. ""‘Hey, I know that play. That’s my stuff. I taught y’all everything y’all know. I’m y’all daddy. I made y’all. I’m the reason for everything y’all got going on.’ He’s just yelling all this stuff.""
One anonymous parent who was present for the altercation on Sunday confirmed to Fox News Digital that Newton had been taunting those on the field.
Steph went to confront Newton after their game to talk about what was being said, which is when things began to escalate. TJ was just walking up the long staircase when video shows Newton grabbing Steph by his jacket after they were face-to-face trading words.
TJ jumped in, throwing a punch at Newton before the latter grabbed him and the fight moved toward a fence.

""If you’re walking up a flight of stairs, and you see a 6’6"" guy grab your little brother trying to throw him down some stairs, you’re going to intervene,"" TJ said. ""It doesn’t matter who you are, rather it be a punch, rather it be a push, rather it be grabbing him. You’re going to do something. So, at that point, with Cam putting his hands on another grown man, something is going to come behind that.
""If you ask anybody about me, I’m not confrontational, I’m not loud, I don’t get mad at people, I don’t argue with people, I don’t fight, I don’t do none of that crazy stuff. That’s not me.""
Atlanta police and others got involved to de-escalate the situation. No arrests were made and no charges were pressed, though Steph, TJ and Newton were ordered to leave the grounds.
The TSP coaches felt there was a lack of accountability by not only Newton, but the organizers of the event as well. While nothing has ever escalated to a fight, it has gotten close for Newton, as they mentioned him getting into it with an event photographer at a Miami 7-on-7 tournament earlier this month.
""This is typical Cam Newton behavior on the 7-on-7 scene,"" TJ said. ""But yesterday was a little worse, and you can even ask people in his organization. Cam ain’t never act like that. I’ve seen him talk crazy to parents, talk crazy to some of the kids because everybody tries to make it seem like, ‘Oh, the kids just be disrespecting Cam.’ No, Cam be disrespecting people, too.
""He’s just got to understand we’re people. Nobody’s just going to let you go around disrespecting and talking crazy to them. I know how to brush it off, but not everybody’s like that.""

TJ and Steph both pointed out having good relationships with players and others on the C1N side, which is why they did not like their own actions during the situation.
""To the C1N players, I apologize. This is your big brother telling y’all that,"" TJ said. ""A lot of y’all know us personally. We apologize for putting y’all in that situation like that because it should never come to that. We love y’all. Some of the coaches and people that are a part of the organization, we love y’all. We still have relationships.""
Steph added, ""I’m disappointed in myself. I let Cam trigger me to that point where I entertained what he was doing, but it was never out of ill will or to put him in harm’s way. I’m 5’9"", man, but I stand on what I stand on. I say what I’m going to say no matter what. I ain’t got to be loud, this and that. But me going up there was to let him know, ‘Cam, you’re not gonna disrespect our organization, you’re not going to disrespect our kids or our parents out here. You’re bigger than that.’""
While the situation appears to be a relationship that was once good and now torn to pieces, the TSP side hopes they can reconcile their differences with Newton and C1N soon.
""We got to do better as men,"" Steph said. ""We’re Black men. We got to do better. Cam, I don’t care how much money you got, this and that. But you don’t put your hands on nobody. …I look at you as a brother. You let [something] not football come in between that.""

""It still ain’t too late to figure this out,"" TJ said. ""Because at the end of the day, it’s about these kids. He’s got kids on his team that I train and coach. We got kids on our team who he knows. We got kids on our team who know some of the players and play with some of the players on his team in high school. Any time it gets to that, we have to figure this out because now these kids and their relationships are involved.""
Newton and C1N did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the altercation when asked by Fox News Digital.

The rule states that ""any sports, leagues, organizations, teams, programs, or sports entities must expressly designate as one of the following based on the biological sex at birth of the team members/participants when applying for a use and occupancy permit to utilize Nassau County Parks property for the purposes of organizing a sporting event or competition: 1) Males, men or boys or 2) Females, women or girls or 3) Coed or mixed, including males and females.
""Nassau County Department of Parks, Recreation & Museums shall not issue any permits for the use and occupancy of Nassau County Park’s property for the purposes of organizing a sporting event or competition that allows athletic teams or sports designated for females, women, or girls to include biological males.

The executive order defined gender as the ""individual’s biological sex at birth; and a statement of a team member’s/participant’s biological sex on the team member’s/participant’s official birth certificate is considered to have correctly stated the team member’s/participant’s biological sex at birth if the statement was filed at or near the time of the team member’s/participant’s birth.""
""It is imperative that a supportive and safe environment is maintained to foster and nurture these opportunities in sports for biological females,"" the order says.
James sent the cease-and-desist order Friday, calling it discriminatory against transgender women and a ""clear violation of New York’s Civil and Human Rights Law."" She also claimed it violated the U.S. Constitution’s ""equal protection"" clause in the 14th Amendment.
""The attorney general is relying on a human rights law, that, quite frankly, I believe is unconstitutional. But even if it was, (the order) would not violate the state law. The state law is not being violated.
""There are opportunities for transgender athletes to compete here in Nassau County, so we’re not precluding them. And, basically, all it says is that you have to be truthful. And we want a safe environment and a fair environment for women to compete here in Nassau County.""
Blakeman also made the point in an interview with OutKick contributor Riley Gaines on the ""Gaines for Girls"" podcast, saying he had an ""obligation"" to uphold the Constitution in Nassau County.
He told Fox News Digital residents of Nassau County ""don’t want our biological women to be bullied by biological males.""
""That’s the reason why we took this step for me to issue an executive order, which merely states that if you identify yourself or advertise yourself as an all-girls team or an all-women team or league, biological males cannot compete.
""We want our leagues and our teams to be transparent about who they’re letting in so that women know and girls know they have a level playing field to compete, that there’s not unfair competition. And we’re not creating safety and security issues for the young people who use our fields each and every day.

""Again, this is not transphobic. It’s not anti-transgender. Biological males who identify themselves as transgender females can compete against other biological males, or they can compete in coed leagues.

"February 23, 2024 4:00am EST",Ranking top 5 free agent NFL quarterbacks heading into 2024 season,Fox News,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
As NFL fans look ahead to the free agency period next month, where some of the top quarterback options land is always top of mind.
This free agent class is not as star-studded as past years, but there are some interesting names that are likely to find homes as potential starters heading into the 2024 campaign.
Let’s rank the top five options at quarterback in the free agency pool, as every NFL club gears up to improve their rosters for next season, starting at No. 5.

There are arguments for the likes of Sam Darnold, Mitch Trubisky or Tyrod Taylor to be number five on this list, which is not the best group to choose from. However, there is more than meets the eye when it comes to Jacoby Brissett’s career 18-30 record as a starter.
Last season, he did not do much with the Washington Commanders, who worked with rookie Sam Howell all season despite collecting a 4-13 record. However, with the Cleveland Browns in 2022, Brissett went 4-7 while Deshaun Watson served his suspension, throwing for 2,608 yards in 16 games (11 starts) with 12 touchdowns and six interceptions.
Brissett is an accurate passer (over 62% completion rate over the last three seasons) who has proven to do whatever is necessary to pick up first downs and give his team a chance to win. He does not have that X-factor other quarterbacks do, but he is someone the locker room respects for his work ethic and getting it done on the field.
If he is a starter, it is mostly as a holdover looking to the future. However, Brissett will land with some team because of how good of a backup he can be if, like with the Browns, he needs to be called upon.
HOW PATRICK MAHOMES' RESUME STACKS UP AGAINST THE ALL-TIME GREAT ATHLETES THROUGH 7 SEASONS
The 27-year-old gunslinger is not afraid of any moment, even if was taking over the starting role for the Indianapolis Colts when rookie Anthony Richardson went down for the year.
Gardner Minshew almost helped get Indy into the playoffs, owning a 7-6 record as a starter with 3,305 yards,15 touchdowns, nine interceptions and a 62.2% completion rate. He is also sneaky, running in for three touchdowns and picking up seven first downs with his legs this past season.
""Minshew Mania"" has bounced around the NFL since coming in as a Jacksonville Jaguar in 2019, but his performance last season proves he has what it takes to get the job done on game day, and he could be the right someone to compete with, say, Kenny Pickett for the Pittsburgh Steelers job next season.

Speaking of the Steelers, someone like Ryan Tannehill, a seasoned veteran who has years of playoff experience under his belt, could be the perfect fit for a team looking to either add a new starter, or compete with someone already on the roster.
Tannehill will be entering his 12th NFL season, his first six coming with the Miami Dolphins before joining the Tennessee Titans. Former Titans head coach Mike Vrabel decided to give the reins to rookie Will Levis last season, a year that was lost and allowed Levis to get acclimated to the league.
In turn, Tannehill hits the market looking for his third NFL team, and for him, one where he can earn the starting job with a good camp. He is 81-70 during the regular season as a starter and has shown the ability to use both his arm and legs to put points on the board.
CHIEFS' PATRICK MAHOMES DOWNPLAYS TOM BRADY COMPARISONS AHEAD OF SUPER BOWL LVIII
Other than the Steelers, teams like the Atlanta Falcons, Minnesota Vikings and Tampa Bay Buccaneers all need veteran quarterbacks next season to work with their offensive weapons on the roster already, as well as those to come. Tannehill could be the man for one of those jobs.
The Bucs were mentioned as a team looking for a veteran quarterback, but it was only because Baker Mayfield had a one-year, prove-it contract last season. And boy, did he prove it by getting Tampa Bay into the playoffs and beating the Philadelphia Eagles on his home turf, 32-9, in dominant fashion.
Tom Brady’s retirement from football left the Bucs needing to answer many questions last offseason, and they decided to go with the 2018 first overall pick as their next quarterback. It was a one-year tryout for Mayfield, who should be in good standing with the front office now after posting a 9-8 record to win the NFC South.
Mayfield threw for 4,044 yards with 28 touchdowns and 10 interceptions, showed tremendous aggressiveness with his legs when needed and surprised some who believed the Bucs to be one of the bottom-of-the-barrel teams in 2023.
If he does not return to the Bucs next season, other teams should be calling his agent to see if he would suit up for them because of what he proved in 2023.

This one goes without saying, but the four-time Pro Bowler is coming off a torn Achilles he suffered against the Green Bay Packers last season.
The Vikings looked to be heading to the playoffs with Kirk Cousins dropping dimes all over the field, even with Justin Jefferson suffering a hamstring injury that kept him out for weeks. Through just eight games, Cousins threw for 2,331 yards with 18 touchdowns and five interceptions and had a completion percentage just under 70%. Minnesota went 4-4 during those games.
Now, it would not shock anyone if Cousins returns to Minnesota next season to keep things going there as their franchise man. He has spent six seasons up north, where he has had a 50-37-1 regular-season record, though they have not done much in the playoffs.
However, the return of Cousins to a team with Jefferson, Jordan Addison, T.J. Hockenson and others could compete against some of the best NFC teams in the league, including the San Francisco 49ers, who they took down in primetime last year with Cousins under center.
However, do not rule out the other quarterback-hungry teams that could be clamoring to see Cousins working with their weapons, like the Falcons, who have everything they need in place. They just need the right quarterback to lead the way under new head coach Raheem Morris.

The one caveat with Cousins is how his 35-year-old self will return from that Achilles injury. Teams will need to feel secure with their investment in him, and word of that should leak out with free agency just around the corner.

"March 2, 2024 4:51pm EST","Former Steelers star, two-time Super Bowl champion Andy Russell dies at 82",Fox News,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Former NFL linebacker Andy Russell, who helped the Pittsburgh Steelers transition from a struggling franchise into championship contenders, has died, the team confirmed on Saturday. He was 82.
The cause of Russell's death was not immediately known.
Russell won two Super Bowls during his storied run with the Steelers. He was a 16th-round draft pick in 1963 and went on to play in the NFL for 12 years. But he hit pause on his football career for two years after his rookie season to fulfill his military commitment required as an ROTC member.
Russell was named to seven Pro Bowl teams and had a ten-year stint as a team captain.
""Andy was part of the foundation of the great Steelers teams of the 1970s,"" Steelers president Art Rooney II said in a statement. ""He was one of the few players kept by Coach Chuck Noll on the team after he became our head coach in 1969. Andy was the team captain and his leadership was a critical part of Coach Noll’s development of the 1970s Steelers, which paved the way to four Super Bowl Championships.""

Russell's greatness was on full display during the 1975 postseason, when he set a playoff record for the longest fumble return. During a game against the Baltimore Colts, Russell picked up the ball and ran 93 yards for a touchdown.
Cincinnati Bengals linebacker Sam Hubbard broke Russell's earlier this year when he had a 98-yard return in a playoff game against the Baltimore Ravens.
BART STARR'S WIDOW, CHERRY, DIES AT 89
A two-way star during his collegiate career at Missouri, Russell was discouraged from playing in the NFL by his father, who told him it would be an ""embarrassment to the Russell family"" if Andy were to go to the NFL.

Russell followed his father's orders. When NFL teams sent him a questionnaire that included a query on whether he wanted to play professional football, Russell checked the box marked ""No.""
The only team that didn't mail him a survey was the Steelers, who made Russell the 220th pick and then offered him a $12,000 contract and a $3,000 signing bonus.
Russell's initial plan was to play one season for the money and then pursue an MBA. An injury to linebacker John Reger in the season opener against Philadelphia led Russell to enter the lineup to fill in, and he never left.

Russell did eventually fulfill his goal, earning an MBA in finance in 1967 and launching a series of businesses, including an investment firm tied to Wall Street, and starting an investment bank.
Russell retired after the Steelers lost to Oakland in the 1976 AFC championship game. He had two sacks in a divisional round blowout win over Baltimore.
Charles Andrew ""Andy"" Russell was born on October 29, 1941, in Detroit. He was a standout at Ladue Horton Watkins High in the St. Louis, Missouri, suburbs in the late 1950s before earning three letters at Missouri from 1960-62, playing both running back and linebacker.

Russell wrote three books about his career after his retirement and was an avid climber, reaching all 54 peaks in Colorado that reach an elevation of at least 14,000 feet. He remained active in the Pittsburgh community and launched the Andy Russell Charitable Foundation, which supported a variety of local charities across western Pennsylvania.
Russell, a member of the inaugural class of the Steelers Hall of Honor in 2017, is survived by his wife, Cindy, two children and seven grandchildren.

""The attack on Drew Eubanks was unprovoked, and acts of violence such as this are unacceptable,"" the statement reads. ""We unequivocally support Drew, and will continue to work with local law enforcement and the NBA.""
Pistons coach Monty Williams, who was making his return to Phoenix after getting fired last season, called out his former team’s decision to release a statement, which he felt was done too quickly.
""I know there were some statements put out. You know the thing for me is to get all of the information. Make sure I’m clear what happened. The NBA will do an investigation,"" Williams said after the game.

Residents of Kansas City will be voting on whether to repeal a current sales tax that could heavily influence the future of the Chiefs and Royals in the city.
The Chiefs are in the midst of a dynasty, winning their third Super Bowl in the last five seasons a month ago — but team president Mark Donovan admits that dynasty could move.
The city's vote is set to take place April 2, when residents will vote to keep the current tax bill or bring in a new one that both the Chiefs and Royals will use for stadium purposes.

The Chiefs are aiming to overhaul Arrowhead Stadium with renovations that cost $800 million, while the Royals have announced plans to move out of Kauffman Stadium and into the downtown area of the city by the 2031 season (when the current tax deal expires, and as their current lease ends in 2030).
If voters vote to repeal the current tax and replace it with the new proposal, which will last 40 years, the Chiefs and Royals have agreed to sign leases that will keep them in the city throughout the duration of the new tax law.
However, both teams have been mostly silent on their futures if the current tax remains in place, leading to the opposition calling it a ""fear-based campaign"" — until now.

Donovan told KSHB-TV that the Chiefs' ""goal"" is to stay in Kansas City, but that's admittedly no guarantee.
""I just know that for us, the Chiefs, we have to look at all of our options.,"" he said.
When asked about possibly leaving Kansas City, Donovan said, ""I think they would have to include leaving Kansas City.
""But our goal here is we want to stay here. And we're willing to accept a deal, which is actually better for the country, to stay here.""
Those opposed to the bill have expressed concerns that the Chiefs' renovations, and the Royals' new stadium, would be detrimental to local businesses — even knocking some out of the area where the MLB team plans to build.
Donovan admitted that the new bill language is ""confusing,"" but deep down, ""it's really simple"" and ""a better deal.""
""These are not new taxes,"" Donovan said (both bills produce a 3/8-cent tax), ""and we keep both teams.""

There are still some quality arms on the market, most notably defending NL Cy Young Award winner Blake Snell and postseason hero Jordan Montgomery, but the Mets reportedly are not trying to acquire them.
Mets fans may be disappointed with this offseason considering Steve Cohen's wallet should fix wounds after last year's atrocity. But it should be noted that next year's free agent class is stacked.
Juan Soto headlines it, and the Mets' Pete Alonso will reach free agency after this season. But Zack Wheeler, Corbin Burnes, Kyle Hendricks and Shane Bieber are some of the star pitchers expected to test the market, so perhaps the Mets are willing to wait a year to acquire a top arm or two.
But the Mets' rotation was a question mark to begin with, and they are now dealing with another one.

LSU women’s basketball head coach Kim Mulkey sounded off on the melee that ensued late in the team’s SEC Tournament Championship loss to South Carolina on Sunday night.
The incident occurred after Tigers guard Flau’jae Johnson fouled MiLaysia Fulwiley following a steal. Johnson did not appreciate Ashlyn Watkins flexing in her face and pushed her away. As Johnson began to walk away, Gamecocks center Kamilla Cardoso sprinted over and shoved Johnson to the ground.

When asked about the fight, Mulkey did not hold back.
""It's ugly, it's not good, no one wants to be a part of that,"" she said, via ESPN. ""But I'll tell you this, I wish (Cardoso) would've pushed Angel Reese. If you're 6-8, don't push somebody that little. That was uncalled for in my opinion. Let those two girls who were jawing, let them go at it.""

"February 24, 2024 10:08pm EST",Dolphins' Jalen Ramsey takes apparent shot at Vic Fangio's scheme: 'Won't ever forgive dude',Fox News,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
The Miami Dolphins parted ways with defensive coordinator Josh Boyer shortly after the end of the 2022 season. In February 2023, longtime NFL coach Vic Fangio was hired as Boyer's replacement.
Fangio is known for helping develop the two-deep safety look used by teams the past several years to combat high-powered passing attacks.
Miami's defense surrendered an average of 318.3 yards per game under Fangio and finished the regular season ranked 10th in total defense.
Despite what some viewed as a successful first season, Fangio and the Dolphins parted ways last month. The 65-year-old was later named the Eagles' defensive coordinator.

Earlier this week, NFL Network's Mike Garafolo reported the Dolphins told star defensive back Xavien Howard he would be released at the start of the league's new year.
Jalen Ramsey, a seven-time Pro Bowler and Howard's defensive backfield mate, was not happy about Howard's pending departure.
Ramsey took to social media to express his feelings, apparently taking a shot at Fangio in the process.
""I won't ever forgive dude for not utilizing our full skillset!),"" Ramsey said on X, formerly Twitter.
The Dolphins' defensive philosophy did appear to change under Fangio. The team primarily used zone coverage last season, while more than 45% of the Dolphins' defensive plays were man coverage in the years leading up to Fangio's arrival.

Longtime NFL agent Drew Rosenhaus, who represented multiple Dolphins players last season, said there were ""quite a few players"" who were not fond of Fangio's coaching style.
""There were quite a few players on the team that didn't necessarily get along with Fangio, and so it wasn't a great relationship with many of the players,"" Rosenhaus told WSVN-TV. ""There were some guys that loved him, but there were quite a few that didn't.""

President Biden was urged to ""say her name"" Thursday night during his State of the Union address, a reference to Laken Riley, the Georgia college student allegedly killed by an illegal immigrant last month.
When Biden did mention her, it sounded like he botched Riley's first name and said ""Lincoln"" instead.
Naturally, ""Lincoln Riley"" trended on X, formerly Twitter, but the social media platform isn't always perfect.

X described the trend as a ""sports"" topic. Of course, that wasn't correct, but it makes sense.
Lincoln Riley is a real person, the head football coach at USC.
For those who were not watching the speech, it may have been a surprise to see the coach's name top the trending lists on social media out of nowhere. And, sometimes, it's unfortunately not good news.
Pat McAfee, host of ""The Pat McAfee Show,"" spotted the trend and thought the worst had happened to the coach.
""I saw somebody with a microphone last night addressing the entire nation. He made an announcement that Lincoln Riley was dead,"" McAfee said on his show Friday. ""I get on my phone after this event that we’re at, and it’s Lincoln Riley, and he’s trending all over. I click – ‘he’s dead.’ Lincoln Riley’s dead? Wait a second, who said that? The president? Lincoln Riley’s dead? How is this happening?

""I saw his name trending, [so] I’m like, ‘Wait, he was just on the show.’ I was like, ‘What did Lincoln Riley do?'""
Biden was shredded for the apparent mishap, most notably by Laken's mother, Allyson Phillips.
""Biden does not even KNOW my child’s name – it’s pathetic! If you are going to say her name (even when forced to do so) at least say the right name!"" she wrote on Facebook.
""Joe Biden just confused Laken Riley, a college student killed by an illegal immigrant, with USC football coach Lincoln Riley. This just happened. The man’s brain is mush. Incredibly disrespectful,"" Outkick founder Clay Travis said.

Jeremiah revealed he was just texting Mortensen on Saturday.
""He texted me yesterday,"" Jeremiah said as he held back tears. ""He wanted to know how [Spencer] Rattler was doing in the workout. So, we talked about Rattler, we were texting back and forth yesterday. He loved this game.""
""I just want to look at the camera and tell Micki, his wife, and Alex, his son, that every time I talked to Mort, you guys came up because he was so proud of you. He loves you so much. You’re always in his heart. You’re always on his mind. He was a sweet, sweet person with a sweet family. That’s who I’m thinking about right now.""
Eisen added, ""I met Chris Mortensen when I was 26 years old when he was the G.O.A.T. in the making for the ‘Worldwide Leader in Sports’ at ESPN. He was one of the best football reporters that we’ve ever known. He was so nice to me, so welcoming to me when I first got there.""

Three-time Super Bowl winner Patrick Mahomes is a generational talent. In addition to being one of the most physically gifted players in the NFL, Mahomes also brings some strong leadership skills to the table.
Mahomes' former teammate, Tyreek Hill is widely considered the most talented wide receiver in the league. Hill's time in Kansas City came to an end when he was traded to the Miami Dolphins after the 2021 season.
Although Hill believed the Dolphins were the superior team in 2023, the Chiefs went on to win their second consecutive Super Bowl. Hill did recently heap praise on his former quarterback, describing Mahomes as the NFL's best.

""Pat is a different dude, bro,"" Hill said during a recent appearance on ""The Pivot"" podcast. ""He’s obviously the best quarterback in the league.""
Hill then recalled a time when Mahomes' leadership was on full display. He detailed the time when Mahomes devliered a fiery speech and called out the team's entire offensive unit.

""This dude called the whole offense up,"" Hill said. ""This is like on a Tuesday, I believe, he called us all up. He cussed all of us... out. Like, me and Pat, we go back and forth. ""But that was a moment right there where he stood on business and it was like, ‘Bro, I really respect this,’ because he really just called out all his weapons individually, pointed us out, looked us in the eyes and said, ‘Bro? Reek? You think you’re so... fast, but you can’t catch the... ball. You want to be the best receiver in the game?’ And he was letting me have it.""
Hill added that no player was safe from Mahomes critique, including star tight end Travis Kelce.

""Then he went to (Travis) Kelce, then he went to D-Rob (Demarcus Robinson), then he went to Sammy (Watkins). He went to all of us, calling us all out. In that moment right there I was like, ‘Yo, it’s go-time, now. That put so much, I don’t know, fuel in my heart, bro. Like, that next game? That’s when we began to get things rolling, because you never wanna get called out by the leader of your team like that. You don’t.
""And it’s like, ‘Bro, I’m not gonna let nobody die in the circle right here no more.’ And we started killing after that."" Hill did not that he was not clear on the exact year that Mahomes delivered the speech, but it likely happened during 2019 season when the Chiefs were in the midst of a slump.

Hill admitted that it was tough to take in Mahomes' blunt remarks, but he also realized that the words were exactly what the team needed to hear at the time.
""Being able to have them tough conversations is needed, I feel like, bro,"" Hill said. ""Because that got us better when Pat did it. It made me want to kick his ass, but it made me want to get better.""

A pair of Dallas Mavericks fans have gone viral after their reactions to Kevin Durant approaching them after some heckling on Thursday night.
The man in the viral video has admitted to calling the two-time NBA champion a ""b---h,"" but it was the woman's reaction that has become a meme, being left hanging on a high-five.
Luke Brawner said he had called Durant the name because his since-deceased friend, Luke, referred to him as such, because he was had been upset that Durant had left the Golden State Warriors in 2019. Brawner says that he and the woman had gone to the game to honor Luke.

But Durant wasn't happy with the jeer, and security threatened to kick them out. But Durant actually convinced security to let them be.
Brawner seemed blindsided that Durant approached them, admittedly not realizing that athletes are humans, too, despite saying it was ""just a joke.""
""I don’t want to justify anything that was said,’’ Brawner told KEGL radio in Texas. ""But I do want to provide some context. . . . It was just a joke to us, but we forget the humanity of the person on the other end of that joke.""

""I’m used to seeing this person on highlight reels,’’ Brawner said. ""I’m used to seeing this person’s face, and I can yell at the TV all day long, but you sort of forget when you remove the humanity from that person, that your words still really matter.""
Brawner, though, seemed at peace with what he had done.
""Ironically, I do think that the moment did honor my friend,"" Brawner said. ""Wherever people go after you die, wherever he is out in the ether, he was laughing — hard – and loving it. . . .  We had an amazing night. It didn’t ruin our night in any way. But it was wild. I did not imagine so many folks would hear about it.""

Joe Flacco, the NFL’s Comebacker Player of the Year for the 2023 season, won’t be heading back home to await a call from another franchise.
Flacco and the Indianapolis Colts reached a deal for one year worth up to $8.7 million, ESPN reported on Wednesday. Flacco gets $4.5 million guaranteed in the deal.
With Gardner Minshew leaving for the Las Vegas Raiders in free agency, the Colts needed another backup for Anthony Richardson, their fourth overall pick last year who suffered a shoulder injury that ended his rookie season prematurely.

Flacco didn’t start the year with any franchise, but the Cleveland Browns came calling when Deshaun Watson’s season ended due to a shoulder injury.
Flacco was signed to the practice squad in late November, and after head coach Kevin Stefanski tried rookie Dorian Thompson-Robinson first as Watson’s replacement, Flacco earned his first start two weeks later.
JOE FLACCO NAMED NFL COMEBACK PLAYER OF THE YEAR AFTER MIRACULOUS RUN WITH BROWNS
What transpired was jaw-dropping, as Flacco looked like his Super Bowl self, becoming the first player in league history to throw for over 250 yards and multiple touchdowns in his first five games with a new team.
Flacco went under center, and Stefanski did not have training wheels on his playbooks. The first start, a 36-19 loss to the Los Angeles Rams, saw Flacco throw for 254 yards with two touchdowns and one interception.

But from there, the Browns never lost on their way to a wild card berth. Flacco helped Cleveland to a four-game win streak, averaging 340.5 yards per game with 11 touchdowns and seven interceptions. He didn’t even need to play the final regular-season game after clinching.
Flacco, 39, wasn’t able to keep his streak alive in the playoffs, though, falling to rookie phenom C.J. Stroud and the Houston Texans in the Wild Card Round. Still, Flacco’s efforts, which no one saw coming, helped a desperate team reach their playoff goals.
While the Colts certainly hope Richardson can have a healthy 2024 season, knowing Flacco is backing him up — and he clearly still has some left in the tank — gives solace to head coach Shane Steichen in case Richardson can’t play at any point.

The New York Giants are ""absolutely done"" with quarterback Daniel Jones, NFL Network broadcaster and radio host Rich Eisen said on his show on Monday.
The Giants entered the 2024 offseason in an interesting predicament. The team has the No. 6 overall pick in the draft with rumors swirling they are willing to move up in the order with hopes of selecting a quarterback, while some fans may prefer a wide receiver in the first round.

Eisen fanned the flames of the possibility of the Giants moving on from Jones even as he just finished up an injury-filled 2023 in the first year of a four-year, $160 million contract he signed last year. The Giants guaranteed $92 million of that contract with $81 million guaranteed at signing.
""The Giants are absolutely done with Daniel Jones,"" Eisen said on his show. ""Might have to play him this year, but that ain’t it, and they feel that ain’t it. The words I heard at the Combine multiple times were ‘buyer’s remorse.’""
The NFL Scouting Combine is typically when rumors start to move and swirl as teams put up smoke screens to turn other teams to try to drum up interest for players potentially going on the trade block.
Jones only played in six games during the 2023 season. He was coming off of a year in which he led the Giants to the playoffs for the first time since 2016. He showed just how effective he could be when he is at full health.

BRONCOS TO RELEASE RUSSELL WILSON AFTER 2 SEASONS
Giants general manager Joe Schoen expressed faith in Jones last week.
""I have faith in Daniel as our starting quarterback,’ he said.
Schoen said Jones understood the team will need to add a quarterback at some point to back him up.
""He's coming off an injury. Tommy DeVito is under contract and Daniel, so we'll bring in either a veteran quarterback through free agency – Tyrod (Taylor) is in the mix there, too,"" Schoen added. ""We're going to talk to Tyrod’s representatives this week, and Tyrod’s a true pro. He has been really good for not only Daniel but Tommy DeVito and his progress throughout the year. He's a true pro.
""So, we'll address the position. Again, it can be through free agency, and it doesn't preclude us from doing it in the Draft as well.""

""As far as our tour goes, like I said, we're doing our best to create the best product for the fans, and that's really where we're at.""

America's Team apparently is not for everybody.
The Dallas Cowboys are the most valuable franchise in North American sports. Simply put, Jerry Jones has built an empire.
That empire, though, has stretched far beyond the gridiron. AT&T Stadium cost $1.3 billion to build, and The Star, the team's headquarters that holds a practice facility and strip mall, cost $1.5 billion.

But one former Cowboy seemed to hint that all the extracurriculars may be a distraction.
Dalton Schultz spent his first five seasons with the Cowboys before inking a one-year deal with the Houston Texans prior to last season.
Schultz said he was afraid to leave Dallas, considering it was all he had known in the NFL. But once he got to the Texans, he was relieved to know that the organization's ""focus is just football.""
""That was one of the first things that kind of stuck out to me, is like, it feels like much more – I don’t want to say college because it’s not – but the focus is just football, you know what I mean?"" Schultz said on ""The Pat McAfee Show"" on Wednesday.

TRAVIS KELCE SAYS HIS YEARLONG MARIJUANA SUSPENSION WAS 'RED FLAG' FOR COWBOYS IN RESURFACED CLIP
""Going back and telling some people how kind of being around the Cowboys' practice facility, game day, describing some of the interactions and stuff that you see on a daily basis surprised a lot of people. They’re like, ‘Holy c**p, that actually happens at a practice facility?’ You think it’s normal, and then you come to a place like this.""
What apparently has been deemed abnormal, Schultz revealed, is fans being able to see the team work out through one-way mirrors, leading the facility to be ""a zoo.""
""There’s people literally going on tours while you’re lifting in the weight room. And they’ve got, like, they’ve got a one-way mirror for people to like look at. It's a zoo, dude. There’s people tapping on the glass trying to get people’s attention as they’re doing power cleans or what not. It’s just, it’s different.""
""That’s the brand that they’ve built. That’s what Jerry Jones likes. That’s the way that they run things, and there’s nothing wrong with that. It’s just you don’t realize how many eyeballs and how much that can maybe distract from stuff just in a locker room being in the facility until you go somewhere else, and you’re like, ‘Holy c**p, dude, there’s none of that.’""

Schultz recently reportedly signed a three-year extension with the Texans after he played a vital role in their offensive game plan, helping C.J. Stroud win Rookie of the Year this past season.
Houston made the playoffs by winning the AFC South, and many expect them to be an even bigger threat in 2024.

Major League Baseball's decision to reduce the game's pitch clock by two seconds with runners on base was premature, the players' union contends.
Tony Clark, executive director of the MLBPA, suggested conversations about the pitch clock were shorter than they should have been.
""That's a conversation that should have warranted a much longer dialogue than what we had,"" Clark said via The Associated Press. He also noted that some players expressed concerns about the shortened clock when they learned about the proposal.
""We voiced those concerns, players voiced those concerns, and yet, the push through of the change to the pitch clock still happened.""

The pitch clock, along with limits on infield shifts and several other rules, was adopted ahead of the start of the 2023 season. It gave pitchers 15 seconds to start their motion if there are no baserunners and 20 seconds with someone aboard.
The clock is shortening this season to 18 seconds from 20 with men on base and will stay at 15 seconds with no one on.
Game time averages dropped considerably in 2023 as a result of the pitch clock. Major league games were cut by an average of 24 minutes, the quickest games have been finished since 1984.
MLB EXECUTIVES DEFEND NEW JERSEYS AFTER BACKLASH: 'EVERYTHING WAS PERFORMANCE-DRIVEN'
The clock, adopted over the objection of player representatives on the competition committee, was considered a huge success, and the sport drew more than 70 million fans to ballparks for the first time since 2017.

Clark also suggested that the 2024 season should have been used to allow for players to fully adjust to the clock.
""We just had the biggest adjustment this league has ever seen in regards to length of game and how the game was affected by including a clock,"" Clark said. ""Rather than give us another year to adjust and adapt to it, why are we adjusting again, and what are the ramifications going to be?""

Clark’s main concern seems to be that pitchers have less time between pitches to recover, particularly when maximum effort and pitch velocity are so important.
""When fatigue happens, you’re more susceptible to injury,"" Clark said. ""We’re seeing a lot of injuries, and we’re seeing them in a way that simply can’t remove the question of whether or not shortening recovery time is in anyone’s best interest.""

Aside from the pitch clock adjustment, Clark will also have to contend with the uncertainty surrounding the A's potential relocation and backlash stemming from new uniforms, while also keeping an eye on the prospect of players playing in the 2028 Olympics.

Tim Tebow is doing his best to make a difference after his football career, and one of his upcoming efforts is among his most important.
OutKick exclusively learned Thursday that Tebow is set to testify before the the House Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on Crime and Federal Government Surveillance, headed by chairman Rep. Andy Biggs (R-AZ) on March 6th. The focus of Tebow's testimony and the hearing will be about the ongoing increase in child sexual abuse material being distributed across the United States as well as other countries.

Tebow, through his Tim Tebow foundation, has worked together with homeland security investigations (HSI) with a mission to identify and rescue as many victims of child sexual abuse as possible. Tebow intends to share what he's learned through the foundation's work as to the devastating, horrifying rise and prevalence of materials depicting child sex abuse.
CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM
The hearing will be an opportunity to bring more attention and public interest to just how prevalent these child sex abuse materials have become. Tebow and his foundation in 2023 worked in conjunction with HSI on ""Operation Renewed Hope,"" a three week ""surge"" of investigations into child abuse.
According to the foundation, they successfully located ""311 probable identifications of previously unknown victims, including 14 positive contacts and confirmed the rescue of several victims from active abuse.""
The foundation also said that the investigations were widely considered ""the most successful operation of its kind."" International partners across Europe and South America were also involved, highlighting just how global this problem has become.

""At the Tim Tebow Foundation, we are so grateful to work alongside so many heroes in law enforcement from around the world and for the blessing of being a part of ‘Operation Renewed Hope.’ Reflecting on this operation, and the incredible life-changing work being done, I think of the renewed hope for so many of these boys and girls,""  Tebow said. ""The best definition I’ve ever heard of the biblical form of hope is to look forward with confidence, anticipation, and expectation, and I can only imagine that for so many of these children suffering through this abuse that they probably had lost all hope and had little reason to look forward.""

""... He did come away impressed by the makeup of this team. He acknowledged a 7-10 team doesn’t typically have the No. 1 overall pick, and he called the opportunity to potentially go to Chicago pretty exciting.""
A spokesperson for ESPN declined to comment on the matter.

This has led to speculation about what the Bears plan to do with Justin Fields. Chicago has missed the playoffs in each of Fields' first three seasons and has had no postseason wins since the 2010 season.
General manager Ryan Poles did not reveal any details of the Bears' draft plans but did say that he hopes to ""do right"" by Fields if the organization does draft a quarterback in the first round.

Richard Jefferson blasted his ESPN colleague’s take on court-storming after Jay Bilas suggested those who enter the playing field to celebrate upset victories should be arrested for the action.
Jefferson, who played several years in the NBA after a standout collegiate career with Arizona, took apart Bilas’ take on ESPN’s ""NBA Today.""
""That’s gotta be the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard in my entire …,"" Jefferson said on Monday. ""Did he say detain 10,000 people? Did he say give 10,000 people citations?""

Jefferson said he has had the court stormed on him as a player a handful of times, and ""it sucks.""
""But this is about college basketball, this is about college football. To say something, and I love Jay Bilas – a legend in this game – that is asinine to suggest that,"" he continued. ""Because for me, when you look at this, yeah, get your players off the floor. … But this is a part of college sports, it always has been, for what? Forty years? Fifty years?
""You know what? Even in football. You’re gonna stop all the people from running on the field when Alabama loses to Florida A&M? No, you’re not going to stop it. Figured out a way to protect your players. Again, we’re talking about one situation, two situations over the course of how many court stormings?
""We get it. But let’s not get old and get the ‘Get off my lawn, get a citation, let’s arrest them all.’ Do we know what we’re talking about when we say these things?""
Jefferson said if fans paid their tuition and went to support their team in an underdog situation against a blue blood like Duke, Arizona, Kansas or Kentucky, then ""Look, you deserve to storm the court.""
Bilas brought up his idea earlier on Monday.

CAITLIN CLARK MIRRORS ‘PISTOL’ PETE MARAVICH IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE
""The truth is nothing’s going to change now,"" he said on ""First Take."" ""We’re going to talk about it. It’s going to go away, and nothing’s going to change. And if they wanted to stop it, they could stop it tomorrow. The administrations will tell you the security experts tell them that it’s not a good idea to try stop the court-storming, because that could cause more problems than it would solve.
""But you don’t have to stop the court storming. One time, all you have to do is, once they’re on the court, don’t let them off. Just say, ‘You’re all detained,’ and give them all citations, or arrest them if you want to. And then court stormings will stop the next day.""
Bilas then suggested the media was complicit in the court-storming.

""Years ago, when fans would run out on the field or the court during a game, it was network policy not to show that because we didn't want to encourage it. So what does that say about the way we in the media use these images now? We can't deny that we encourage it or at least tacitly approve of it.
""Everyone has to accept some responsibility for this. I don’t think it’s the right thing to allow this, but I know that it’s gonna continue. This is not going to stop.""
Duke star Kyle Filipowski had to be helped off the court after Saturday’s incident.
It appeared a fan made contact with him running from the left side of the court. The fan who appeared to hit Filipowski fell to the court, and Filipowski somehow ended up in the arms of Duke staff.

"March 6, 2024 4:46pm EST","NJ referees admit blowing call in controversial HS basketball playoff game, won't overturn result",Fox News,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
The Garden State remains in an uproar after a controversial ending to a high school boys basketball playoff game, and their frustration will likely grow after referees admitted getting a crucial call wrong at the final buzzer.
The ending in the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association (NJSIAA) Group 2 semifinal between Camden High School and Manasquan High School went viral on Tuesday night for all the wrong reasons, as what looked to be a buzzer-beating tip-in from Manasquan was called off to give Camden the victory.
After further review, the NJSIAA admitted the officials on the floor got it wrong.

""NJSIAA understands Manasquan’s frustration regarding the outcome of last night’s game,"" the NJSIAA wrote in a statement, via NJ.com. ""We never want a contest to end with controversy or confusion.""
The play in question revolves around what happened after Camden’s Alijah Curry hit a free throw that put his team up one point with 5.8 seconds left. Manasquan needed to go the length of the floor to score a game-winner to move on to the state final.
Rey Weinseimer of Manasquan heaved a three-pointer, which was heavily contested, and it hit off the right side of the rim. But his teammate Griffin Linstra appeared to tip the ball back off the glass and into the hoop before the buzzer sounded.
NEW JERSEY HS BOYS BASKETBALL PLAYOFF GAME ENDS IN CONTROVERSY OVER BUZZER-BEATER: ‘THEY SCREWED THESE KIDS’
Video angles of the last-second shot clearly show Linstra’s release coming before the clock struck zero, which should’ve made it a good basket and a Manasquan victory. One official thought so, but after conferring, they ruled it wasn’t released in time and Camden got the victory.
""Here, all of the events happened within the final second of the game. One of the three officials counted the basket as beating the buzzer. The three officials then met at half court to confer. A second official saw the ball in the shooter’s hands when the buzzer sounded. The officials then waived off the basket. Later, after being shown video clips, the second official agreed the basket should have counted.""
Manasquan and its supporters wanted some justice after the wrong call was made, but they’re not going to get it from the NJSIAA, which added a hard truth to its statement.
""That said, the rules are clear – once game officials leave the ‘visual confines of the playing court,’ the game is concluded, and the score is official,"" the NJSIAA said. ""So, while the officiating crews’ reports indicate that a post-game review of footage of the play in question convinced them that the basket should have counted, the results could not then and cannot now be changed.
""Also, NJSIAA Program Regulations, Section 14 – which governs the use of video – states, ‘No video or audio recording may be used to review or challenge the decision of a sports official.’ In addition, NJSIAA Bylaws, Article VII, Section I prohibit protests ‘based upon an official’s judgment or misinterpretation (misapplication) of the playing rules.’ The ruling on the court is, exclusively and by rule, what determines the game winner.""

The NJSIAA also made note that, unlike college and pro sports, the use of replay in high school basketball in New Jersey is not present.
So, overall, it’s an explanation that the NJSIAA can only end with an apology before moving on to the final with Camden playing and Manasquan’s season at an end.
It’s an unceremonious end, one that turned a court-storming celebration into utter confusion and defeat. Manasquan head coach Andrew Bilodeau did not hold back his thoughts to the Asbury Park Press on Tuesday night.
""They reversed the call,"" he said. ""The referee in the C position in the middle signaled ‘basket’s good,’ they huddled up and then 15 kids got screwed in front of 1,000 people.
""Print that. Print it five times. Those three guys huddled up, and they screwed these kids in front of 1,000 people and that video will be on the internet for everyone to see.""
The video from NFHS Network of the final-second play went viral on social media, with many chiming in believing Manasquan was ""screwed"" as Bilodeau put it, including former Rutgers men’s basketball head coach Mike Rice.
""This wasn’t even close. Manasquan got robbed!"" he tweeted.

The Dartmouth men’s basketball team has taken a historic first step in challenging the norms of college athletics, voting Tuesday to unionize.
The team voted 13-2 to join Service Employees International Union Local 560, which already represents some of the school’s employees, in an election supervised by the National Labor Relations Board.

""Today is a big day for our team,"" Dartmouth juniors Cade Haskins and Romeo Myrthil said, via The Associated Press.

""We stuck together all season and won this election. It is self-evident that we, as students, can also be both campus workers and union members. Dartmouth seems to be stuck in the past. It’s time for the age of amateurism to end.""
The vote to unionize was met with immediate pushback from the school, which quickly filed an appeal to the NLRB with hopes of overturning a decision last month that set the grounds for this week’s vote.
""For Ivy League students who are varsity athletes, academics are of primary importance, and athletic pursuit is part of the educational experience,"" the school said in a statement.

CAITLIN CLARK'S HISTORIC PERFORMANCE DRAWS MASSIVE AUDIENCE FOR FOX SPORTS
""Classifying these students as employees simply because they play basketball is as unprecedented as it is inaccurate. We, therefore, do not believe unionization is appropriate.""
Some have praised the vote, including Major League Baseball Players Association executive director Tony Clark who released a statement praising the team’s efforts.
""The MLBPA applauds the Dartmouth men's basketball players for their courage and leadership in the movement to establish and advance the rights of college athletes,"" Clark said.
""By voting to unionize, these athletes have an unprecedented seat at the table and a powerful voice with which to negotiate for rights and benefits that have been ignored for far too long.""

This is just the latest in the ever-evolving landscape of college athletes. If successful, Dartmouth men’s basketball would be the first program in NCAA history to unionize.
Dartmouth had filed a motion to delay this week’s vote unsuccessfully. Now, both sides will have until March 12 to file an objection over the election procedures.

"March 10, 2024 9:23pm EDT",Trevor Bauer reacts after outing vs Dodgers minor leaguers: 'I'm still one of the best pitchers in the world',Fox News,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
For the first time in nearly three years, Trevor Bauer pitched against professional hitters in the United States, and they were members of his former team, the Los Angeles Dodgers, on Sunday afternoon.
Bauer was pitching for the Asian Breeze, an independent team based in Japan that plays exhibition games against minor leaguers in hopes to catch the attention of scouts, in his first game in the States since he was suspended a record 194 days for violating MLB’s domestic violence and sexual assault policy.
Bauer was initially hit with a 324-game suspension in April 2022, which came 10 months after he was placed on administrative leave due to sexual assault allegations. His suspension was later reduced, but the Dodgers released him.

With many fans on hand to see Bauer pitch, including some wearing ""Bring Back Bauer"" T-shirts, the 33-year-old righthander dominated his minor league opponents.
Bauer’s fastball reportedly topped out at 99 mph several times as he went on to record four strikeouts against 12 batters. Three of the batters Bauer faced were on the Dodgers’ 40-man roster: outfielder Andy Pages and catchers Diego Cartaya and Hunter Feduccia.
Just this time three years ago, Bauer was ready to play against some of the best in the game after signing a three-year, $102 million deal to join the Dodgers.
TREVOR BAUER OFFERS ADVICE TO ASPIRING ATHLETES AFTER SETTLING LEGAL DISPUTE
But now he’s playing in hopes of getting back into the league, though reports say no Dodgers or MLB scout was in the stands to watch him pitch.
""I mean, if you think about it, I should have the opportunity to sign with a big league team,"" Bauer told a scrum of media members, per ESPN. ""I'm just asking for the league minimum, so it's not a money thing. I've served my suspension twice over. I've been cleared of everything in the legal system. If you think about it logically, there's really no reason I shouldn't have a job.
""But I don't. So, it is what it is. We'll see how it plays out. I don't want to predict the future. We'll see.""
After his Dodgers release, Bauer went to Japan to pitch for the Yokohama DeNA Baystars. He owned an impressive 2.59 ERA over 156.2 innings in 24 games at two different levels for the Baystars. Bauer struck out 160 batters and walked just 34.

""I just stay ready and maybe people somehow will remember that I’m still one of the best pitchers in the world,"" Bauer said, per USA Today.
Bauer was originally supposed to pitch at the Arizona Diamondbacks’ complex with the Asian Breeze on Saturday, but his start got moved.
ESPN learned a source close to Bauer said that him playing on the Dodgers’ grounds was cleared with the team.
""I don't really care who I pitch against, honestly,"" Bauer said when asked how it felt facing a Dodgers squad. ""I just like to pitch. Hopefully, they enjoyed it and had a good time. I tried to enjoy it and have a good time, tried to entertain the fans, which is what I always try to do. Dodgers or any other team, it doesn't really matter, I just enjoy pitching.""
Bauer said he’s a better pitcher now since playing in Japan. He returned to the States with a splitter in his pitching arsenal as well as his heater, which gained velocity overseas.
""Hopefully, today reminded them that I'm still an elite pitcher. If not, that's fine, too,"" he said.

The New Orleans Pelicans appear firmly entrenched in Stephen A. Smith's crosshairs.
Over the past several months, Smith has brought attention to Pelicans star Zion Williamson's weight. And Smith's most recent criticism of Williamson sparked a feud between the Pelicans social media team and the high-profile television personality.
""Zion Williamson, it’s not about his game,"" Smith said last week during an appearance on ESPN's ""Get Up.""
""It’s about how many burgers he’s eating. Whether he is going to be in shape or keep eating McDonald’s. …That’s what he has to prove, that the chefs don’t love him any longer.""

The remarks appeared to prompt the Pelicans to post a graphic showing Smith's stats from his 1990-91 basketball season. The Pelicans also shared a video on X, formerly Twitter, featuring Smith making a number of athletic blunders.
""It doesn’t bother me that you troll me. I can take it,"" Smith said in response to the video during a recent edition of his podcast, ""The Stephen A. Smith Show.""
""You see, do you realize at Division II Winston-Salem State, I could have been on the court averaging 20 to 25 [points] a game, and I still wouldn’t compare to a single one of y’all who made it to the NBA? Do you understand that I know that no matter how you gloss over anything, meaning myself or anybody else, I don’t compare to y’all?""
Smith cited a 1989 injury for his low point total.
""I was hurt … 1989. I cracked my kneecap in half. They told me I might never be able to walk the same again, and even though I maintained my scholarship, I was nothing more than a practice player because I couldn’t run up and down the court more than three or four times without limping. How do we know this? Because I’m 56, and I still limp after running for a little while."" Smith said.

Smith did acknowledge he does not compare athletically to Williamson or his teammates because they are professional players. But he also took some jabs at the Pelicans.
""I couldn’t shine Zion’s shoes, nor C.J. McCollum, nor Brandon Ingram, nor any of them,"" said Smith. ""That’s why y’all in the NBA and I’m not. But let me tell you something about you New Orleans. Because since we want to be up here and we want to make sure that we are as thorough as we can possibly be. Let’s talk about the New Orleans Pelicans franchise for a second.
""You are in your 22nd season in New Orleans since your relocation from Charlotte. Ladies and gentlemen, do you know that by being named the Hornets and then the Pelicans, you have as many names as you do playoff series victories in 22 years. You have won two playoff series in 22 years. You have the same amount of playoff series victories as you do names! And you are talking about me? At least I’m not robbing the public by getting paid for not doing what I’m supposed to be doing, which is win.""
Smith addressed Pelican analyst Antonio Daniels, who described the ""First Take"" host's initial comments as ""inappropriate and lazy.""

""I was joking around about Zion Williamson not eating too much. We need him healthy, on a good diet so he’s strong and he’s powerful. I did not imply that he’s not doing it now. I said it as a concern, Antonio Daniels. I said it as a concern, New Orleans Pelicans. I was half joking because I’m rooting for the kid, and I’m rooting for the franchise,"" Smith said.
The Pelicans appeared to continue the dispute with Smith by posting a meme that featured three messages that said, ""I ain’t watching all that,"" ""I’m happy for u tho"" and ""or sorry that happened,"" in an apparent response to Smith's 10-minute video.

"February 27, 2024 8:22am EST",LSU star Flau'Jae Johnson reveals what she wants to see from WNBA before turning pro,Fox News,"WNBA star Kelsey Plum wants to see her league market superstar players better.
Name, image and likeness (NIL) deals in college sports has been a hot topic in many circles, and one of the arguments is whether turning pro for student-athletes is appealing, considering they can make substantial money in college now.
LSU Tigers women's basketball star Flau'Jae Johnson knows all about these new opportunities for college athletes. According to On3, the sophomore guard's NIL valuation is at $1.1 million, which is third-highest among females in college sports and 16th overall. Only LSU gymnast Livvy Dunne ($3.5 million) and teammate Angel Reese ($1.7 million) are higher on the list.
Women's college basketball has many stars, which also include the projected No. 1 pick in the 2024 WNBA Draft, Iowa's Caitlin Clark, whose valuation is at $910,000. So, when the average salary in the league is around $147,000, there are some who wonder if going pro is beneficial for these types of stars.

However, while financials are important for Johnson, she pointed out another aspect that she would like to see improve from the WNBA by the time she is allowed to enter the draft, which would be two years from now.
""The conditions for the players,"" she told Fox News Digital while discussing her excitement for Powerade's new ""March Doesn’t Start in March"" campaign heading into tournament season. ""You go to college, and you’re treated like a pro. Then, you go to the pros and you’re treated not like a professional. In that way, I say the league can be better. I know everybody will say revenue, but it’s going to take time for the game to get to where it’s supposed to get.
""I think just the conditions for the players – living arrangements, travel arrangements – that’s very important to the athlete. I was fortunate enough to be in college for the NIL era, so I’ll be more than fine going to the league. But, yeah, that’s very important.""
KELSEY PLUM BELIEVES WNBA MARKETING SUPERSTARS BETTER WILL HELP 'GROW THE GAME TREMENDOUSLY'
Jonquel Jones of the New York Liberty recently spoke to Fox News Digital about the sacrifices WNBA players make every year, which include having to play overseas during the offseason to make up for the financial lapses in WNBA contracts.
Now, players do have the option to stay in the U.S. and do other media work in the offseason, but some choose to go to other countries where they have the chance to earn around $1 million or more.
Players like Johnson don’t have to stop their NIL deals once they turn pro – at that point they’re simply endorsements for the player.
As for the conditions Johnson mentioned, travel has been a major topic of discussion in recent seasons when Liberty owner Joe Tsai, who also owns the NBA's Brooklyn Nets, was fined by the WNBA $500,000 for providing his team charter flights in 2022. It went against the collective bargaining agreement between the league and the players' union, as it said there may be a potential unfair competitive advantage over franchises that could not afford charters.
As such, WNBA teams primarily fly commercial, and sometimes that means entire days traveling across the country. However, heading into the new season, the league expanded its charter flight policy, allowing private flights for all postseason games, back-to-back games and select regular-season games. WNBA teams also have the ability to book flights on JSX, which is in a sense a chartered flight as teams can purchase the entire flight for themselves on an already-scheduled route.

Johnson is used to chartered flights in college, as it’s a requirement that’s federally mandated by Title IX since male athletes at schools are chartered.
Players, though, will say that is not enough, and the likes of Jones, Las Vegas Aces' Kelsey Plum and many other stars in the league continue to fight for what other leagues provide players each season.
""I think shedding a light on that is going to hopefully bring more of those conversations to the table and allow the Caitlin Clarks and Angel Reeses to not have to do what we do,"" Jones told Fox News Digital.
""I think it’s dope that they care about leaving it better than how they found,"" Johnson said about current WNBA players wanting to change the league for future stars like herself. ""I think that’s the goal with everything.""
In the meantime, Johnson will continue to cash in on deals with brands like Powerade, the official hydration partner of March Madness, who also brought in USC men's basketball star Isaiah Collier for their new campaign. Johnson pointed out how the campaign's title is true, as not many see the hard work that goes into the season before March Madness rolls around.
LSU Tigers women's basketball player Flau'Jae Johnson holds up Powerade. (POWERADE)
""March definitely doesn’t start in March,"" she said. ""It’s all a grind. but it’s just about the best player you can be. You’re working every day. I don’t think people understand how hard we go every single day in order to be the best. Even the work nobody sees.""
""March Doesn't Start in March"" is the first March Madness campaign to feature NIL athletes, and they will have activation across many platforms, including a commercial that will debut on national TV on March 17 during the NCAA Selection Show. More than 40 additional NIL athletes also teamed up with Powerade to provide more digital and social content for the campaign.

Anthony Kim put together his best round on the course since returning to professional golf this weekend, but he still finished dead last at his first LIV Golf event.
Kim finished 16-over par in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, over the weekend, which was 32 strokes behind event winner Joaquin Niemann.
Kim, a former prodigy on the PGA Tour who disappeared from the game for more than a decade, posted a 4-over round on Sunday, which was better than the 7-over rounds he posted on Friday and Saturday. He also finished even-par in his final 14 holes on Sunday, which some may view as good progress.

Others, however, may say Kim’s time in professional golf has come and gone.
But in his first tournament action in quite some time, Kim took his brutal start in LIV Golf in stride.
""Obviously, it was a rough week,"" Kim said, per Yahoo Sports. ""I’m excited to be playing professional golf again, and I feel pretty blessed I have this opportunity.""
ANTHONY KIM, GOLF STAR WHO DISAPPEARED FROM PGA TOUR, PLANNING RETURN TO PRO GOLF: REPORT
Kim’s return to professional golf made waves when ESPN initially reported that he would be returning. However, some took exception to him choosing LIV Golf over the PGA Tour, the latter of which he was a fan-favorite.
Kim had a four-season run on the PGA Tour, where he was almost always near the top of the leaderboard. He finished third in the 2010 Masters and tied for fifth at The Open Championship the following year.

But the most memorable was his 2008 Ryder Cup performance as a rookie on the team, starting off the tournament with a dominant 5&4 match-play victory over Spain’s Sergio Garcia. The United States ended up defeating the Europeans in the end.
Kim has three PGA Tour victories under his belt, but injuries eventually shut him down from the game in 2012.
It’s been a while since the days when Kim was once ranked No. 6 in the world on the links, but he’s using this opportunity with LIV, where he’s a wild card who will play as an individual instead of a team for the rest of the season, to make his comeback.
""I’m definitely hitting the ball well, doing lot of things well. I know scores don’t reflect that,"" he said.

Former ESPN star Sage Steele praised UFC President Dana White’s decision to keep Bud Light as the company’s official beer sponsor in partnership with Anheuser-Busch.
Bud Light received immense backlash over the last year for its partnership with trans activist Dylan Mulvaney. Bud Light saw Modelo surpass it as the No. 1-selling beer brand, and its sales were still down through the first month of 2024.

""I get it, but I said to Dana when we met a couple of weeks ago … I love that he did that because it’s like, No. 1, everybody deserves a second chance, in my opinion,"" Steele said on the show. ""I really do believe that. And secondly, what a brilliant business move.""
""When a company is down, down and out, losing billions of dollars, guess what, from a strictly business perspective, they’re going to pay up to try and fix their image.

"March 6, 2024 3:19pm EST",A's unveil rendering of planned Las Vegas stadium,Fox News,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
The Oakland Athletics and their design teams released renderings Tuesday of the club's planned $1.5 billion stadium in Las Vegas that show five overlapping layers with a similar look to the famous Sydney Opera House.
The A's hope to move into that 33,000-seat domed stadium in 2028, depending mostly on the construction timeline. A glass window beyond the outfield provides an outdoor feel with views of the Las Vegas Strip.
Also included is an 18,000-square-foot video board, which would be the largest in Major League Baseball.
VEGAS MAYOR: ATHLETICS' STADIUM PLAN 'DOES NOT MAKE SENSE,' TEAM SHOULD 'FIGURE OUT A WAY TO STAY IN OAKLAND'
Bjarke Ingels Group and HNTB are the architectural firms in charge of the design.
""The collaboration between BIG’s creativity and HNTB’s technical expertise allows for a truly innovative and bold design while ensuring an unmatched fan experience,"" A's owner John Fisher said in a statement. ""We hope to add to the dynamic atmosphere and liveliness of the Las Vegas Strip, creating a welcoming environment for all of Southern Nevada.""
The stadium would be built on nine acres of the 35-acre site owned by Bally's on the corner of Tropicana Avenue and Las Vegas Boulevard. The Tropicana resort that currently sits at that location will be demolished to make room for the stadium and a hotel. The $1.5 billion price tag includes $380 million in taxpayer money approved by the Nevada Legistlature.
""The A’s have created a remarkable design that adds to the rich fabric of must-see attractions in Las Vegas,"" Bally’s Chairman Soo Kim said in a statement. ""This is a once-in-a-generation project, and we are thrilled for the opportunity to develop a comprehensive site plan at this iconic location. We look forward to sharing more on our plan in due course.""
The Sydney Opera House and its roof resembling sails billowing over the city’s harborfront make up one of Australia’s most iconic views.

There also are plans for 2,500 parking spots at the new stadium, though fans will have nearby garages they also can use. Garages are used for parking at T-Mobile Arena, which is down the street on Tropicana Avenue.
This would be the smallest stadium in MLB, though Tropicana Field where the Tampa Bay Rays play has a capacity of 25,000 when the upper levels are closed off. It otherwise holds just under 40,000. The Rays, however, have announced plans to play in a 30,000-seat stadium to be constructed near the current site.
Cleveland plays at Progressive Field, which now seats 34,830. It was 43,345 when the park opened in 1994.
MLB owners unanimously approved in November the A's application to relocate, but there remain many questions before they move.
MLB OWNERS APPROVE A'S MOVE TO LAS VEGAS FROM OAKLAND
The A's will stay in Oakland at least through this season, but no announcements have been made about their home games beyond this year. They met recently with the city to discuss the possibility of an agreement to play there beyond 2024.
Playing across the San Francisco Bay in the Giants home is another possibility, as are a temporary move to Salt Lake City or Sacramento, California.
Though the A's have set 2028 as the target date to play in Las Vegas, construction or legal delays could push back that timeline.
The A's are set to play spring training exhibition games at the Triple-A Las Vegas Ballpark on Friday and Saturday.

He added that he wanted to win at least two more Super Bowls in the next five years.
""For me, it's about winning. In the next five years, I want to win two,"" Wilson said. ""I want to feel the chill of that trophy again. I love the city and everything else, but you also want to be in a place that loves you, too. I want to win, that's all I care about.""

According to Wilson, the conversation revolved around the guarantee against injury in his five-year, $245 million contract he signed last year. The contract kicks in next season.
Wilson has an estimated $37 million salary in 2025, which becomes fully vested in March. If the quarterback suffered a significant injury at any point in the season, it would complicate his financial situation, NFL Network reported.

It may be spring training, but long home runs are always fun to admire.
Daniel Vogelbach did just that when he hit an absolute nuke off defending AL Cy Young Award winner Gerrit Cole.
In Cole's first start of spring training, he faced the Toronto Blue Jays under the lights, and Vogelbach, the fourth batter Cole faced, got the best of him.

On a 2-1 count, the big lefty tanked one off the New York Yankees ace well beyond the right-field fence, giving the Blue Jays a 2-0 first inning lead. But the Yanks got the last laugh with an 8-4 win.
Vogelbach dropped the bat with some swagger and admired his bomb, walking out of the batter's box before a nice slow jog.
Vogelbach took his time trotting around the bases, which Cole took personally.
""Yeah, what’s the day? Are we still in February? March 1? Yeah, he enjoyed that homer,"" Cole said after his outing.
""I don’t forget a lot of things.""
The 6-foot, 270-pound Vogelbach isn't exactly fleet of foot. His sprint speed ranked in the bottom 2% of the majors, and only nine players were slower last year than Vogelbach, who's known as Danny Burgers on social media.

NATIONALS PROSPECT STRETCHERED OFF FIELD AFTER FLIPPING OVER FENCE IN ATTEMPT TO ROB HOME RUN
Yankees manager Aaron Boone added that Cole ""seemed to not love it.""
There is no love lost between the Yanks and Blue Jays. Aaron Judge created controversy last season against the Jays when he seemed to peek into his own dugout just before slugging a home run, prompting sign-stealing talk.
The next night, coaches from both sides got into a war of words, including Blue Jays manager John Schneider, who told someone he referred to as ""fat boy"" to ""shut up.""
Vladimir Guerrero Jr. has said he'd never play for the Yankees, calling them the ""easiest team"" to play against in 2022. The Yankees won the division that year on Toronto's home turf.

Blue Jays pitcher Alek Manoah also called Cole ""the biggest cheater"" in baseball in 2022, citing his use of sticky substances.
Cole won the Cy Young after the league's crackdown on sticky stuff, while Manoah was demoted to the minors for a time last year due to his struggles.
The two have exchanged words on the field before, with Manoah challenging Cole to meet him face-to-face on the field.
Vogelbach has yet to play a regular-season game with the Blue Jays, but it seems like he's been taking notes from some of his new teammates.

""Kenny has given a great deal to this university over a span of nearly 40 years, and he will always be a valued member of our Louisville family,"" Director of Athletics Josh Heird said in a statement provided by the school.
""When we brought Kenny home in 2022, no one had a stronger belief than me in his potential success, but it's become clear that a change is needed to help this program achieve what is expected and attainable. While it is always difficult to make a coaching transition, this is the right one for our program.""
Payne signed a six-year, $8 million deal when he returned to Louisville in 2022. According to The Associated Press, he is expected to receive a buyout on the deal, which paid a base annual salary of $3.35 million plus incentives.

Following Tuesday’s loss, Payne was asked about his future with the program and how he would make his case to return for a third season after his 8-24 campaign this past season. He indicated that he lacked support, but did not specify from whom.
""It’s unfortunate that we’re talking about this right now. When I walked into the program as the new head coach, I talked about (how) I needed everybody on the same page. We sort of forgot that. I talked about how I’m not going to let you blame me – I’m not standing up here by myself. I need all of Louisville with me. We sort of forgot that,"" Payne said.
""I talked about (how) it’s going to take time, and I’m going to watch and see who jumped on and off the Titanic. We sort of forgot that. I gave a specific time – I said three or four years, and I’m good with it. That’s what I believed at that time, and that’s what I still believe it takes to fix this program.""

""Saquon Barkley signing with Philadelphia. How ‘bout this? Huge, huge signing for Philadelphia. And I’m happy for Saquon. I’m not trying to talk trash, but you’re coming to a team that’s had a legitimate offensive line established for a very long time.""

Kelce also pointed out how run game coordinator Jeff Stoutland, the longest-tenured Eagles coach, will certainly help get Barkley acclimated to his new squad quickly.
But, as Travis commented about how many players on the offensive side of the ball are Pro Bowlers, which should give the Eagles another great chance at making a Super Bowl run, Jason couldn't contain his thoughts.
""I could not be more bullish,"" he said. ""We talked about it last week – this is what I’m regretting. I knew when I retired that I was going to miss just an outstanding season for the Philadelphia Eagles. It sucks, it really does. I want to be a part of this so bad. I wish I could.""
EAGLES' JASON KELCE ANNOUNCES RETIREMENT FROM NFL
Eagles fans have been all over social media following Barkley's signing, hitting up Kelce to get back in the building and go at least one more year.
""Social media has been nonstop like, ‘Jason, you sure you want to retire?’ I’m like, ‘Yeah, pretty positive.’ Even though little upset Howie [Roseman] waited until I retired to make a move like this! But it’s fine. It’ll work out great,"" he said.

Kelce is content with his decision, one that has been years in the making. He teetered with the decision to retire earlier, but after a disappointing end to the 2023 campaign, he felt it was time to put away the pads and finger tape.
As of now, it's already an exciting start to the new season in Philadelphia, a team that also brought in dynamic edge rusher Bryce Huff, re-signed Brandon Graham for another season, and had a reunion with safety C.J. Gardner-Johnson.
Kelce may not be on the field, but he'll remain a fan of the only team he played with in his career.

In recent years, the use of gender pronouns has become a controversial topic, and now there are apparently classes for how to use them properly.
Riley Gaines said she had to take a she/her pronoun ""training"" during her senior year at Kentucky, the same year she faced transgender national champion swimmer Lia Thomas.
""Senior in college. Twenty-one years old,"" Gaines said on Joe Rogan's podcast, seemingly still stunned from the ordeal.

""What in the world? How can you be an outside professional?"" she asked rhetorically.
The professional ""sat us down and taught us how to use she/her pronouns.""
Rogan could hardly hold it in.
""They taught you, an actual she/her, how to use she/her pronouns?"" he replied.
Gaines gave a behind-the-scenes look at the ""training.""
""We had to go through these interview questions. They threw a question at us. If we didn’t answer their fake interview question to their standard, we had to go through it again,"" she said.

""I kid you not,"" Gaines added, ""the university responded back, ‘If you as women feel uncomfortable seeing male genitalia, here are some counseling resources that you should seek in an attempt to re-educate yourselves.’""

LSU women’s basketball coach Kim Mulkey came under scrutiny from Pro Football Hall of Famer Shannon Sharpe following the skirmish in the SEC Tournament Championship against South Carolina.

""It's ugly, it's not good, no one wants to be a part of that,"" Mulkey said, via ESPN. ""But I'll tell you this, I wish (Cardoso) would've pushed Angel Reese. If you're 6-8, don't push somebody that little. That was uncalled for in my opinion. Let those two girls who were jawing, let them go at it.""
Sharpe pushed back on that during ESPN’s ""First Take."" He said South Carolina coach Dawn Staley was acting classier for trying to downplay the incident involving one of her players and accused Mulkey of trying to hype the brouhaha up.
""You mean it figuratively, not literally. ‘Oh, we’re gonna fight. We’re gonna fight them tooth and nail. We’re gonna scratch and claw. You give nothing, you allow them to take nothing,’"" Sharpe explained. ""But Kim Mulkey, instead of saying, ‘You know what, sometimes when emotion is high, logic is low. And that’s not what women’s college basketball is about. Especially, with the love and support the women’s game has received this year thanks to Caitlin Clark, thanks to USC, like JuJu Watkins, and some of the others.’ But for you to take that stance: ‘I wish Cardoso could’ve pushed Angel Reese.’ … Really?

Luke McCaffrey ran a 4.47 40-yard dash, according to NBC Sports Bay Area. Christian McCaffrey ran a 4.48 40-yard dash before the 2017 draft.
The 40-yard dash alone doesn’t determine draft position, but McCaffrey showed his versatility on the football field in college. He started his collegiate career at Nebraska playing quarterback. He only played in 11 games during his first two seasons and then transferred to Rice.

McCaffrey started out as a quarterback with Rice but switched to wide receiver before the start of the 2022 season. He caught 129 passes for 1,715 yards and 19 touchdowns during his two seasons of being a wideout.
The 6-foot-2 wide receiver could end up being a day-three draft selection, which means any team, including the 49ers, could end up selecting him at some point.

The NFL franchise tag has long been a topic of discussion among players in the league, but one former player has the latest hot take on the controversial contract situation.
Domonique Foxworth, a former defensive back in the league, believes the franchise tag is ""un-American.""
""So is the salary cap,"" the ESPN analyst said on the ""Ross Tucker Football Podcast"" Monday. ""Like all of these are actually illegal. They violate antitrust law.""
CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM

Foxworth, who used to be president of the NFL Players Association, as well as COO of the National Basketball Players Association, has seen it all from a contractual standpoint in multiple leagues. He explained his case further.
""They only exist because the union exists,"" Foxworth said. ""The funny thing is, in ’93, the way the union was able to get free agency was by de-certifying the union, essentially disbanding the union and forming a trade association and suing the league for their antitrust violations, which include the Draft and all that sort of stuff and not allowing players to have free agency.
""The ironic thing is, upon coming to a settlement, the league required that the players re-form a union, because they needed that union to protect them so they could be allowed to have all these antitrust violations. So, while I think obviously as a former president and leader of two sports unions and very heavily involved, I think the union is very much for the rights of the players. It provides a great deal of protection for the league also. Otherwise, they wouldn’t be allowed to have a draft, or collude in the many ways they are legally allowed to collude.""
COACHES INVOLVED IN CAM NEWTON FIGHT REVEAL WHAT LED TO ALTERCATION WITH NFL QB: ‘TYPICAL CAM’
To break it down even further, the NFL, in exchange for allowing free agency and other benefits to players, forced them to recreate their union, so they can have a collective bargaining agreement. And in said CBA is the ability to have the franchise tag among other things, including the NFL Draft and the salary cap.

Of course, the idea of the franchise tag, which isn’t used in any other major sports league in the country, has been a topic players have become disgruntled with, especially in recent seasons.
Star players can’t hit the open market when their contracts are up like in other leagues, with teams able to lock them in for at least another season.
Some teams do that to allow more time to negotiate contracts. However, looking at examples like the New York Giants and Saquon Barkley in 2023, that doesn’t always come to fruition. Barkley eventually agreed to his franchise tag, but other players might want to hold out even going into the regular season, though that would lead to hefty fines.

Legendary college football coach Nick Saban dished on what contributed to his decision to retire as the general of the Alabama football program after years of dominance.
Alabama’s 2023 season started rocky with a 34-24 loss to Texas in Week 2. But the team managed to win the rest of the way, including on a miracle touchdown from Jalen Milroe against Auburn. Alabama then topped Georgia in the SEC Championship to make the College Football Playoff.

The Crimson Tide then suffered a 27-20 overtime loss to Michigan in the semifinal. The Wolverines went on to win the national championship weeks later.
For Saban, he was seemingly taken aback by his players’ reaction to the loss — both in the immediate aftermath and when the team returned to Tuscaloosa, according to ESPN.
""I want to be clear that wasn't the reason, but some of those events certainly contributed,"" he told ESPN of his decision to retire from the sport. ""I was really disappointed in the way that the players acted after the game. You gotta win with class. You gotta lose with class.
""We had our opportunities to win the game and we didn't do it, and then showing your a-- and being frustrated and throwing helmets and doing that stuff... that's not who we are and what we've promoted in our program.""

Saban said he believed his messaging wasn’t coming across. He said players were asking for ""assurances"" they were definitely going to play and ""how much are you going to pay me?"" Saban said the program was intended to build for the players’ futures and possible NFL careers.
""So I'm saying to myself, 'Maybe this doesn't work anymore, that the goals and aspirations are just different and that it's all about how much money can I make as a college player?’"" Saban added.
""I'm not saying that's bad. I'm not saying it's wrong, I'm just saying that's never been what we were all about, and it's not why we had success through the years.""
Saban’s departure sent shock waves through college football. He finished his college football career with seven national championships — six at Alabama and one with LSU.

Three-time NBA All-Star Ben Simmons lack of availability has been a point of contention in recent years.
He has only appeared in 15 of the Brooklyn Nets' 61 games so far this season, and the point guard's name is once again list on the team's latest injury report. Simmons appears to be continuing to deal with some discomfort from a nerve impingement in his back.
After missing a significant amount of time in the early portion of the season, Simmons returned to the lineup in January. However, after just nine games, Simmons was sidelined again with an injury.

Simmons mental health played a role in his extended absence when he was a member of the Philadelphia 76ers, but his physical health has seemed to cause more setbacks since he's landed in Brooklyn. Simmons held out during the 2021-22 season. The hold out was ultimately compounded by his back issues, which resulted in Simmons missing the entire season.

In two-plus seasons with the Nets, Simmons has missed 121 of 178 possible games. Simmons signed a five-year, $170 million extension in 2019. Simmons' agent, Bernie Lee, is now taking his share of the blame for the NBA star's apparent inability to overcome the string of injuries. Simmons has attempted to work through the back injuries without undergoing surgery.
""It is a continuation of the same injury that he has dealt with all year,"" Lee told SNY. ""We are trying to get clearer answers as to how to get him out of the reactive cycle he's in. ... We continue to try and find non-surgical options to allow Ben to move forward on a permanent basis and that is where this is my responsibility, and I am [the] one to blame.""

Lee also detailed how he vowed to provide Simmons with ""the right answers"" to help him move past the injury issues.
""When I began working with Ben I made a commitment to him that I would do everything I could to find the right answers and specialists for him to work with [in order] to move forward from the issues he has been having. Clearly it hasn't happened, and that's my responsibility.
""In the year I have worked with Ben, he has taken less than seven days off. In my almost 20 years doing this, [it] isn't something I've seen. So the thought that he is doing everything asked of him but not getting the results is something that in no way shape or form sits right with me, and I am committed to finding him the right people and the right answers, and we will.""

""Come the offseason, we're going to implement some processes and outside input that'll allow him to finally move forward from this ongoing issue and resume his career at the levels he's established prior to being injured,"" Lee said.

Initial rumors of his retirement came after the Eagles lost to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the NFC Wild Card round. He was visibly emotional after the game.
""Although last season truly sucked, I wouldn’t trade my team with you or those teams for the world,"" Kelce said. ""Everything happens for a reason. And I truly enjoyed my time with you coach. Sometimes, the flowers get knocked back a bit but the roots remain. And I can’t wait to watch as it re-blossoms next season.""
He played in 193 games in his NFL career, the second most in team history. He made 156 consecutive starts – a franchise record.
""It is difficult to put into words how much Jason Kelce has meant to everyone in this organization, to the City of Philadelphia, and to our fans,"" Eagles chairman and CEO Jeffrey Lurie said in a statement. ""He gave everything he had to all of us for 13 years, and he did it in a way that was truly authentic. Jason was an incredible football player; a future Hall of Famer who would have been successful anywhere. But has there ever been a more perfect marriage between a player, a city, and a team?

""His grit and determination, from being a walk-on linebacker at Cincinnati to an undersized sixth-round pick in 2011, are unparalleled. His intelligence and versatility, from starting as a rookie center in a lockout season to thriving under multiple coaches and offensive schemes, set him apart from others at his position. The genuine love and care he showed his coaches, teammates, and staff endeared him to all he worked alongside. The passion and intensity that he poured into everything he did, both on and off the field, made a city fall in love.
""Jason gave of himself for others, played through injuries, and never wavered through all the ups and downs of our seasons and his own personal career. He is a man of many talents – he could chug beers with fans at a tailgate, he could sing in a Christmas album and raise millions for charity, or he could talk X's and O's all day with coaches and teammates. Then after all of that, he could do things out on the football field that no other offensive linemen are capable of doing. If you talk to anyone in the organization about what Jason has meant to them, they would all come up with something different. That is a testament to who he is as a person and how much he cares about connecting with others.

""But even for the millions of fans who never had the privilege of meeting Jason, he had such a deep understanding and genuine appreciation for what was important to them. Nothing exemplified that better than his Super Bowl Parade speech that brought to the surface the emotions that so many of us had been holding inside for years. Today is a bittersweet day, because while it is hard to imagine the Eagles taking the field without Jason Kelce in uniform, we are also excited to celebrate his career and support him as his journey continues. Although Jason is retiring from the NFL, I have no doubt that he will continue to be successful in everything he does, and his impact on our organization and this city will reverberate for many years to come.
""On a personal level, it has been a pleasure watching Jason's career and getting to know him and his family. He and Kylie have devoted themselves to so many great causes, and I am especially grateful for the work they have done and continue to do with the Eagles Autism Foundation. We wish all the best for Jason, Kylie, and their three wonderful daughters as they begin the next chapter together.

"March 7, 2024 6:40am EST","UFC's Sean Strickland rips Bud Light in vulgar post, says he is the 'definition of America'",Fox News,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Anheuser-Busch found itself in some heat when one of their marketing strategies was to have transgender activist Dylan Mulvaney on cans of Bud Light.
The stunt resulted in a decrease in sales amid boycotts and viral videos of people, including Kid Rock, shooting at cans and boxes of the drink.
However, during all the backlash, UFC inked a deal with the brand to make Bud Light its official beer sponsor.

UFC fighter Sean Strickland, though, is not bowing down to who pays his checks.
Strickland has been outspoken against the LGBT community in the past. In 2022, he said he would have ""failed as a man"" if he had a gay son.
Back in January, a reporter took him to task for that comment. Strickland then asked the reporter if he was gay, if he had a son who was gay and whether he wanted a grandkid. The reporter said he was not gay, and it would not be a problem if he had a grandson or not. Strickland replied that the reporter was ""a weak f---ing man.""
On Monday, Strickland kept up his act.
""I'm so sick of these c---s. Even budlight. I'm the definition of America..."" he posted on X. ""yet I'm the bad guy because I believe in two genders? I am the majority. They force feed your kids f---ing pride flags. I just wanna fight back a little...""

UFC STAR SEAN STRICKLAND CALLS MACHINE GUN KELLY A 'WEIRD DUDE' DURING HEATED CONFRONTATION
Appearing on ""The Sean Hannity Show,"" Dana White said his decision to partner with Anheuser-Busch ""was the furthest thing about money.""
""These guys employ 65,000 Americans, thousands of vets they employ. They spend over $700 million a year with U.S. farmers, you know, buying their crops for their product. And there's many, many other reasons that I did this,"" White told Fox News' Sean Hannity on his radio show. ""Where I sit personally with my core values and I felt like the core values of the UFC, even though we're a global sport, and we have fighters from all over the world. This is an American company. And I love this country and this is more about me being aligned with somebody who is a sponsor of the UFC and somebody I'm going to work with every day.""
White alluded to the backlash Bud Light previously received by saying fans ""might not love"" every business decision that is made by either UFC or Anheuser-Busch, but he insisted ""it wasn't a tough decision at all.""
After Strickland's rant in January, White said he refused to give any of his employees a ""leash,"" citing ""free speech.""

"March 7, 2024 4:46pm EST",Gov. Phil Murphy chimes in on controversial New Jersey boys basketball game: 'I feel very badly',Fox News,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
A controversial ending in a New Jersey high school boys’ basketball playoff game has made its way to the top of government in the Garden State, as Gov. Phil Murphy gave his thoughts on it Thursday.
The game between Manasquan High School and Camden High School has made its rounds on social media, as video shows the former hit a buzzer beater that should’ve won them the game. However, after referees reviewed it together on the court, it was ruled that the basket didn’t count and Camden moved on to the New Jersey Interscholastic Athletic Association (NJSIAA) Group 2 final, which will be played this Saturday at Rutgers University.
Manasquan immediately put in an appeal to the NJSIAA to have the result overturned, but they were denied. Manasquan school district is even looking for legal action to protest the result of the game, which the NJSIAA admitted the officials got wrong.

Murphy feels for everyone in Manasquan, though he revealed he can’t do anything on his end about the result.
""Based on all the objective observations, the last-second shot by that kid… left his hand before the buzzer,"" he said at an event in Asbury Park, via NJ.com. ""I feel very badly, particularly for the players and coaches and their families that had one snatched from them. But apparently, NJSIAA is not gonna review it, and the result is the result.""
As Murphy said his piece, the Manasquan school district is exploring legal action to overturn the game, with Superintendent Dr. Frank Kasyan hoping to get an injunction in to stop games moving forward.
NEW JERSEY SCHOOL DISTRICT EXPLORING LEGAL ACTION AFTER CONTROVERSIAL BASKETBALL GAME DECISION: REPORT
""I don’t know what can happen, that is why I turned it over to Michael Gross, our school board attorney,"" Kasyan told the Asbury Park Press. ""I would like to see him get an injunction from the court to stop the games until our protest is heard, because a lot of time what happens is you’ll protest, it drags on, and then it becomes a moot point. So the game is Saturday. This has to happen quickly, and he’s on it.
""I just want to see a just and ethical decision being made by the NJSIAA, and that is what those officials are there for. This is something different. There is physical evidence that shows the game wasn’t over, and the ball went through, so there you have it.""
Murphy added that he has ""no insight"" on a potential lawsuit being filed, adding, ""It’s a crushing way to lose the game.""
The NJSIAA issued an apology to Manasquan on Wednesday in a lengthy statement, admitting after reviewing video evidence circulating online that officials got the call wrong.

But, due to its rules, it can’t overturn games based on that evidence as well as the officials leaving the court with Camden deemed victorious.
""Here, all of the events happened within the final second of the game,"" the statement read. ""One of the three officials counted the basket as beating the buzzer. The three officials then met at half-court to confer. A second official saw the ball in the shooter’s hands when the buzzer sounded. The officials then waived off the basket. Later, after being shown video clips, the second official agreed the basket should have counted.
""That said, the rules are clear – once game officials leave the ‘visual confines of the playing court,’ the game is concluded, and the score is official. So, while the officiating crews’ reports indicate that a post-game review of footage of the play in question convinced them that the basket should have counted, the results could not then and cannot now be changed.""

The NJSIAA also pointed to its regulations, including ""no video or audio recording may be used to review or challenge the decision of a sports official."" Instant replay is not used in New Jersey high school games.
Manasquan school district released a statement after reading what the NJSIAA had to say.
""We appreciate the NJSIAA’s transparency in admitting the error in the calling of last night’s Group 2 Semifinal Boys Basketball game and appreciate their apology,"" it read. ""It is indeed ‘frustrating,’ however, that the NJSIAA refuses to exercise its discretion to remedy a situation that was so obvious and well documented.

"March 9, 2024 10:21am EST",Camden athletic director accused of trolling Manasquan on social media after NJ basketball controversy,Fox News,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Manasquan school district tried everything to overturn the result of the New Jersey Interscholastic Athletic Association (NJSIAA) Group 2 boys basketball semifinal result, even taking legal action after officials waved off a buzzer-beater that should’ve won them their game against Camden High School.
But Camden’s athletic director Will Hickson appears to be moving on since the Tuesday night controversy got swept into the news cycle.
On Friday night, a post came from an X account that is purportedly Hickson’s. The athletic director said, ""See you at Rutgers.."" with heart emojis and the 1989 movie poster for Spike Lee’s ""Do the Right Thing.""

Some in the comments view this tweet by Hickson as trolling considering the lengths Manasquan has gone in trying to reverse the decision made on Tuesday night.
After Camden took a one-point lead in the game, Manasquan had a few seconds to get down the court and win it with a basket. After an initial three-pointer didn’t go in, a Manasquan player smartly ran for the rebound and was able to get a quick tip-in off before the buzzer sounded. Video of the scene clearly shows that time was still on the clock when the ball was in the air.
However, after reviewing it together on the court, the officials waved off the basket, claiming it hadn't been released in time and that Camden had won the game.
NJ SCHOOL DISTRICT FILES LAWSUIT OVER BLOWN CALL IN STATE SEMIFINAL BASKETBALL GAME
As outraged poured over social media, especially after video of the shot had gone viral, the NJSIAA released a statement saying officials agreed they had gotten the call wrong after further review. However, citing their rules, the NJSIAA couldn’t overturn the result to allow Manasquan a spot in the Group 2 final.
Manasquan has done everything to get their boys back on court, but a denial came from an Ocean County Superior Court judge, and the New Jersey Department of Education upheld the officials’ call on Friday, according to NJ Advance Media.
""We’re asking Judge [Mark] Troncone to put the brakes on this game on Saturday pending judicial review of what happened"" the Clark Law Firm told NJ Advance Media of the ""injunctive relief"" they were requesting. ""What we’re trying to do is put the brakes on the [final] game pending on who should be the right team to be in that game and declare Manasquan the winner. We will argue that the NJSIAA’s rules would require them to use the videotape to get the right result here.""

Even New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy commented on the matter, saying, ""I feel very badly"" for Manasquan after seeing the video. However, it wasn’t in his power to do anything about it.
While Manasquan has done all it can but to no avail, Camden school district’s attorney, Lou Cappelli Jr., called their attempts ""ridiculous.""
""Are we going to go back and look at all 32 minutes of the game and come to the judge and say, ‘Judge, this wasn’t a foul? It’s ridiculous,"" he told The Asbury Park Press.
Hickson’s X account was active on Saturday morning as well, posting several hip-hop album covers that might not sit well with Manasquan fans either.
The first album was Public Enemy’s ""Yo! Bum Rush the Show,"" though a Camden High School Panthers logo was placed underneath ""Public Enemy"" on the album. There was also ""Strictly Business"" by EPMD as well.
Hickson also posted Thursday a tweet that read, ""Here at CAMDEN HIGH we like to say… Let the Coaches, COACH! Let the Players, PLAY! Let the Officials, OFFICIATE! Let the Spectators be POSITIVE!""

""Somebody comes out, some expert says, ‘Well, she hasn’t won a championship.’ If I ever see that guy, I’d just punch him, unless he’s really big,"" Boeheim said. ""I won’t do it if he’s really big. But these people, how do they even get jobs saying stuff like that?""
""There should be certain things you say that disqualifies you from ever being on radio or TV again. To bring that up with Caitlin Clark or Karl Malone or John Stockton or people like that – they make their teams so much better, and without them, the Utah Jazz wouldn’t have won too many games without those two guys. And Iowa, I’m sure, wouldn’t win, although I like their team.""
Former Duke star Jay Williams, an ESPN analyst, initially sparked the furor after he downplayed just how great Clark is, citing the lack of championships. He called her ""probably the most prolific scorer the game of basketball has ever seen.""

With Saquon Barkley heading down the New Jersey turnpike to play for the Philadelphia Eagles, the New York Giants were quick to find his replacement.
Former Houston Texans running back Devin Singletary has reportedly agreed to a three-year deal to join the Giants next season, per multiple outlets.
The deal is worth $16.5 million and could get up to $19.5 million with incentives, per ESPN.

Singletary, 26, is coming off a career-high 898 yards with the Texans, where he earned 10 starts over 17 games. The Texans initially went with Dameon Pierce as their starter, but Singletary stood out more as the season progressed, and Houston preferred his services more.
He also collected four rushing touchdowns and averaged 4.2 yards per carry in his one and only season with the Texans.
SAQUON BARKLEY, EAGLES AGREE TO 3-YEAR DEAL: REPORTS
Singletary was drafted by the Buffalo Bills in the third round of the 2019 NFL Draft, and earned the starting role in 2020 when he rushed for 687 yards in 16 games. He was better in 2017 with 870 yards and eight total touchdowns (seven receiving), and had 819 yards and five rushing scores in 2022.

The arrival of James Cook in Buffalo led to him signing with the Texans in free agency last year, and he made the best of his opportunity for a team that made it to the AFC Divisional Round.
It's also worth noting Giants head coach Brian Daboll is familiar with Singletary given his time with the Bills as offensive coordinator prior to joining the Giants in 2022.
Giants fans are still shocked, though, to see Barkley playing for a hated rival in the Eagles, who reportedly will sign him to a three-year pact worth up to $46.76 million when the new league year begins on Wednesday.
Barkley all but confirmed the news with an X post thanking everyone for his six years in a Giants uniform, while being ""excited for the next chapter.""

Singletary will join a backfield that has running backs Eric Gray, a 2023 NFL Draft pick, and Gary Brightwell on the roster now. As of now, Singletary should be the presumed starter in 2024 and beyond.

Jackson, the younger brother of Kansas City Chiefs star quarterback Patrick Mahomes, has been under scrutiny for more than a year. He was charged with aggravated sexual battery stemming from an incident at a Kansas restaurant.
Mahomes was accused of grabbing a woman by her neck and forcibly kissing a woman at the restaurant in February 2023. He appeared at his sentencing hearing on Thursday and pleaded no contest to a single count of misdemeanor battery, online court records showed. Mahomes was then sentenced to six months of probation.
Mahomes was then taken into the custody of the Johnson County Sheriff’s office, which will determine whether he’s eligible for work release.

He previously pleaded not guilty to felony charges for aggravated sexual battery, which were later dropped due to a lack of cooperation from the woman, according to a court filing.
""Like I said from the beginning, Jackson has done nothing wrong. We had full confidence that the truth of the matter would ultimately be revealed. The defense will reserve further comment until the remaining count is disposed of,"" Mahomes’ attorney, Brandon Davies, said in a statement shortly after felony charges against his client were dropped.
The woman reported that she had endured death threats and harassment and that her restaurant had been vandalized in the wake of the charges. She closed the restaurant in August.

She explained that she came to the realization she had to ""grow and learn"" on her own and ""figure out"" what made her happy, and once she did that, she suggested the universe put the right people in front of her.
Break-up rumors between Allen and Williams swirled last year as Williams unfollowed the quarterback on Instagram and appeared to celebrate her birthday without him. Additionally, any mention of Buffalo was removed from her account.
Things got a bit more interesting when the two went to the Kentucky Derby, but without each other. One of Williams’ friends had an eyebrow-raising post on her Instagram Stories.

JuJu Watkins hasn't even finished her freshman season with the USC Trojans, and she has taken the college basketball world by storm.
In the fourth quarter of a game against the Colorado Buffaloes, Watkins drained a deep 3-pointer to secure the 11th 30-point game of her career.
Watkins surpassed former USC star Cheryl Miller's school record for 30-point games in a single season.
Miller was in attendance Friday night and watched Watkins write her name into USC record books, finishing with 42 points.

Watkins expressed gratitude for being a part of USC basketball history.
""That’s insane honestly,"" Watkins said after the game. ""But, of course, it’s Cheryl Miller, so long way to go until I’m in that conversation. I’m just happy to be able to be a part of that Trojan legacy and continue to evolve and grow the game, grow the culture here at SC.""
TOP WNBA PROSPECT PAIGE BUECKERS VOWS TO RETURN TO UCONN NEXT SEASON: 'THIS WILL NOT BE MY LAST SENIOR NIGHT'
USC coach Lindsay Gottlieb described the matchup with Colorado as a ""heavyweight fight."" Before the game, Watkins showed off her impressive talents when she made a one-handed basket from behind the team bench.
The football-style throw caught the attention of Gottlieb, who playfully made sure Watkins' was not on football coach Lincoln Riley's radar.
""Don’t get any ideas,"" Gottlieb jokingly wrote on X, formerly Twitter, tagging Riley and USC football.

Miller has sat courtside during multiple USC games this season. USC's resurgent season has attracted multiple music stars, actors and professional athletes.
Basketball Hall of Famer Spencer Haywood, former NBA player Matt Barnes and WNBA All-Star Satou Sabally also attended Friday's game to watch Watkins and USC win their seventh consecutive game.

Gottlieb said Watkins' success this season has helped remind others of the greatness of Miller and other USC women's basketball alumni.

""The attention that JuJu has gotten, to me and to the team, actually shines a light on Cheryl in a way that it should be, right?"" Gottlieb said. ""She’s breaking these records, and we get to say, ‘Hey, by the way, Cheryl is the greatest of all time.’
""It’s not just Cheryl, but the women who are the ones who played here. They’re not just great USC players, they’re the greatest women’s basketball players of all time.""

Top-ranked UConn suffered a shocking upset loss to Creighton on Tuesday. The 85-66 loss marked just the second defeat for the defending national champion Huskies.
As February itches toward a close, March Madness comes into focus. Aside from UConn, other highly-ranked teams, such as Houston, Purdue and Arizona, appear to be virtual locks for the upcoming Selection Sunday event.
The NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament field is made up of 36 ""at-large"" teams. An NCAA selection committee selects those teams, which are announced during Selection Sunday. The 32 teams who win their respective Division I conferences round out the field of 68 teams.

The teams that are on the cusp of making the tournament typically dominate conversations in the sports world in the days leading up to the announcement.
During a recent appearance on OutKick’s ""Don’t @ Me with Dan Dakich"" former college basketball coach and current ESPN analyst Seth Greenberg discussed the teams he would be surprised if they did not advance to the Final Four.

""I would think its Purdue and UConn in terms of what they've done… their body of work,"" Greenberg said in response to a question about which teams he would be surprised if they did not make it to the semifinals. ""But I think between one and 65, everyone's got scars. Everyone can have a bad day.""

""Connecticut loses at Creighton… it happens. It's just the business of college basketball.""
Greenberg also pointed to the increasing number of distractions today's college basketball players have to contend with, noting that the ""static"" contributes to the team's being upset.
""I think the reason is because of the static around the players. I think it's workout gurus, it's AAU coaches, it's parents, it's NIL … and I'm all for it … I've got no problem with it, but it's just so much more that's on their plate. It's collectives, I guess school fits in there somewhere. It's social media. There's just so much static around these kids it's hard for them to focus on the most important things all the time.""

Now that Caitlin Clark's regular season is over, the fun part of the season is about to begin.

But Clark made the most of the regular season.

Throughout the regular season, Clark rewrote the record books. She first became women's college basketball's all-time leading scorer, and earlier this week, she surpassed ""Pistol"" Pete Maravich for the most points scored in NCAA history among both men and women.
Clark averaged 32.3 points per game in the regular season and was named the Big Ten Conference Player of the Year.
Clark's No. 2-seeded Hawkeyes will play in their first Big Ten tournament game Friday at 6:30 p.m. ET in the quarterfinals. Ohio State, which Iowa defeated Sunday, holds the top seed.
The Hawkeyes will face the winner of Thursday's game between No. 7 Penn State or No. 10 Wisconsin.

Their seed in the tournament will likely be based on their success in the conference tournament. A tournament win would likely give them a top seed.

Steve Belichick, the son of legendary NFL coach Bill Belichick, revealed what’s in store for his father after he didn’t land a head coaching job this offseason.
Steve Belichik made an appearance on ""Green Light with Chris Long,"" where he divulged his father’s intentions heading into the new NFL season, which includes a role in television.
""He’s definitely pursuing some other stuff, whether it’s TV or a regular on ‘Green Light’ or whatever it may be,"" he said of his father.

Steve Belichick also commented on how his father was holding up after leaving the Patriots following 24 years of dominance that included six Super Bowl rings.
""I think he’s good, you know?"" Steve Belichick said after being asked if his father was ""OK"" leaving the Patriots. ""Let the stuff roll off your back and move forward. He doesn’t dwell unless we lost the game and need to get on some guys, but eventually you’ve got to turn the page. Honestly, I wasn’t too involved in any of that stuff. He did his thing, I did my thing and that was kind of that.""
It wasn’t for the lack of trying that Bill Belichick didn’t land a head coaching job. He interviewed with the Atlanta Falcons twice following his mutual parting of ways with the Patriots, which came after a dismal 4-13 season.
TOM BRADY ‘SURPRISED’ BILL BELICHICK DID NOT GET COACHING JOB: ‘THE GREATEST COACH EVER’
However, the Falcons and owner Arthur Blank decided to go with Raheem Morris, the former Los Angeles Rams defensive coordinator, for the job. Several other teams, including the Los Angeles Chargers, Seattle Seahawks and Washington Commanders didn’t bring in Belichick as well.
In turn, a media role became a topic of conversation in NFL circles with regard to Belichick.

Of course, Belichick was known for being stoic when asked questions by the media during his many years as a head coach. But an appearance before the Army-Navy Game this year on ESPN’s ""College GameDay"" might have changed some minds about what he’d be like as an NFL analyst, especially after he put a 1962 Navy helmet on his head.
""I hope he just goes out and is himself and … shows his personality a little bit, which he doesn’t do most of the time, unless you’re in the building,"" Steve Belichick said. ""… Putting on the helmet and stuff like that, he does s--- like that a lot but no one ever sees it. And so, I was happy that people at least saw a better side of him that not a lot of people see.""
Steve Belichick took the Washington Huskies’ defensive coordinator position this month despite Jerod Mayo, his father’s successor with the Patriots, offering him and his brother, Brian, a spot on his staff, per Sports Illustrated.
He joined his father’s staff in New England in 2012, serving as a coaching assistant before working up the ranks. He was named safeties coach prior to the 2016 season, when the Pats eventually won it all on the famous Malcolm Brown interception at the goal line against the Seahawks.

"March 5, 2024 4:00am EST",Paul Heyman to be inducted into WWE Hall of Fame in first ceremony without Vince McMahon,Fox News,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Paul Heyman was announced as the first inductee of the WWE’s Hall of Fame class of 2024 on Monday as the ""Wiseman"" will finally be honored ahead of WrestleMania 40 in Philadelphia.
This year’s Hall of Fame class is one of the more intriguing ones in recent memory. It’s the first one that Paul ""Triple H"" Levesque, WWE’s chief content officer, will be handling without the input of Vince McMahon. The pro wrestling executive left WWE and TKO Group Holdings after he was accused of sexual misconduct – allegations McMahon has denied.

Most of Heyman’s illustrious pro wrestling career is rooted in the rivalry he had with McMahon’s WWE when he helped start Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW). Heyman later worked for WWE after the company bought out ECW and has since been a managerial figure for some of the top stars in the promotion.
""It’s a terribly difficult situation for me to process,"" Heyman told Fox News Digital of the allegations against McMahon. ""And I’m not done trying to understand it all. And therefore, I’m completely unqualified to offer anybody a proper perspective on it because I’m trying to grasp the enormity of the situation still to this moment.""
The WWE began its Hall of Fame inductions in 1993, starting with Andre the Giant, and then stopped after 1996. The company restarted its classes in 2004 to coincide with WrestleMania XX. It has since evolved into a major event.
WrestleMania comes to Philadelphia, the birthplace of ECW. Heyman joined ECW in 1993 and helped turn the company into the hardcore promotion it is famously remembered as.
Heyman told Fox News Digital he doesn’t think of his induction into the Hall of Fame as ""vindication"" for what he helped build in ECW and the impact the brand made on pro wrestling.

""I always thought that what we started in Philadelphia and then what we accomplished on a global basis with ECW was exactly what we had intended to accomplish, which was a complete disruption of the status quo in the industry,"" Heyman said,
""I think this is simply an acknowledgment of a career that is far from over and just giving flowers to someone while they’re still around instead of my children accepting it posthumously for me.""
Heyman revealed he turned down offers to be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame ""several times.""
""I accepted this because, No. 1, and very important to me, this is Paul Levesque’s first year of being completely in charge of the induction process,"" Heyman said. ""And there will be many, many, many years that Paul Levesque will bestow this honor upon people, but there will only be one first. And I have great respect for that man and the job he’s been doing. I would be remiss if I would have turned him down.""

""No. 2, it’s in Philly. No. 3, it’s WrestleMania 40. No. 4, my kids have been nagging me to accept it, and it means an awful lot to them, and so this is really the perfect storm of me accepting it. Though I’ve always been hesitant because I feel like I have so many more years or decades to contribute to this industry, and to accept what is, in essence, a lifetime achievement award while still achieving, has always been, at least to me, somewhat of a humbling conflict.""
Heyman is so far the first inductee of this year’s class. The ceremony takes place April 5 at the Wells Fargo Center.

""Heyman’s influence on sports-entertainment has become immeasurable, as his brash, in-your-face attitude has paved the way for multiple generations of managers and Superstars,"" WWE said in a statement.

And in his very first NHL shift, he dropped the gloves with Matt Martin right as the puck dropped. So, in just one second of ice time, he had accumulated five penalty minutes.
But that was just a preview. On Thursday, in his very first shift in the Hudson River Rivalry against the New Jersey Devils, he was assessed a match penalty for a hit to the head and was ejected in just 10 seconds.
And Rempe hasn't toned things down.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis went after Libs of Tiktok – the popular social media account run by former real estate agent Chaya Raichik – for supposedly ""lying"" about a Florida law that does not permit illegal immigrants to obtain driver's licenses.
Raichik, whose account has nearly three million followers, posted a news video on X about three illegal immigrants from Guatemala who were arrested for forcing a woman into her car and sexually assaulting her. The post garnered over two million views on Wednesday.
""Apparently FL also gives illegals drivers licenses!"" Raichik posted. ""Biden's open borders allows v*olent criminals to terrorize Americans.""
DeSantis, a staunch critic of President Biden's handling of the border crisis, informed Raichik in a follow-up post that Florida law prohibits illegal immigrants from obtaining driver's licenses, in addition to prohibiting ""recognition of licenses issued to illegal aliens from other states.""
Raichik's post also received a ""community note,"" a feature on X that allows users to provide additional context or fact check.
""Truth shouldn't be a casualty of attempts to generate clicks and engagement farm,"" DeSantis wrote on X.

DeSantis' press secretary, Jeremy Redfern, also chimed in and posted screenshots of users questioning why the governor would allow illegal migrants to obtain driver's licenses.
""This is the problem with posting things on the internet: people take you at your word, regardless of the truth,"" Redfern posted.
""The idea that Florida would provide a drivers license to any illegal alien, especially under this governor, is absurd,"" he said.

Prior to the responses, Raichik posted in a separate thread, ""To clarify- Florida law does not allow illegals to get a drivers license.""
The interaction received mixed reactions. Some X users questioned whether DeSantis made the post himself and defended Raichik, while others asked her to delete the original post.
""This could have all been avoided with basic due diligence,"" Jenna Ellis, a former member of Trump's campaign legal team in 2020, wrote on X.
""@libsoftiktok should delete the tweet and apologize, more to preserve her own credibility than anything,"" she wrote.

Libs of TikTok gained popularity beginning in 2021 for exposing controversial elements in the education system, such as sexually explicit material in books and LGBTQ+ resources.

"March 13, 2024 2:54pm EDT",Fox News Politics: TikTok chopping block,Fox News,"Welcome to Fox News’ Politics newsletter with the latest political news from Washington D.C. and updates from the 2024 campaign trail.
What's happening?
-Hunter Biden refuses to attend House hearing
-Trump secures the 2024 Republican nomination
-CNN forced to correct story over Sen. Katie Britt
The House of Representatives has passed a bill that could pave the way for TikTok to be banned in U.S. app stores.
The measure passed 352-65, with one abstention.
Both Democrats and Republicans supported the measure, which advanced out of committee in a unanimous 50-0 bipartisan vote. It's a rare show of bipartisan unity in a heavily fractured political environment.
The bill, led by House China select committee Chair Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., and ranking member Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., would block TikTok in the U.S. if its parent company, Bytedance, does not divest from it within 165 days of passage. It would also require it to be bought by a country that is not a U.S. adversary.
Opponents of the bill — mostly Democrats — raised concerns over free speech issues. Some Republicans objected to the proposal saying it expanded government control over business, and could be abused.
TikTok's release of the Series and Creativity Program Beta incentivizes creators to post minute-long videos by only monetizing content that meets their length requirement.  (iStock)

A coalition of nearly two dozen liberal groups has banded together to protect progressive left-wing ""Squad"" members in Congress from an onslaught of spending before the November elections.
The coalition, Reject AIPAC, was launched to counter the proposed big-money spending by entities linked to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). The coalition seeks to rally behind Democrat politicians such as Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Cori Bush of Missouri, Jamaal Bowman of New York and Summer Lee of Pennsylvania.
AIPAC has vowed to target those progressive lawmakers, and others, over their criticisms of Israel.

""Reject AIPAC is a broad coalition of progressive groups working together to take on the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) and its affiliated dark money Super PACs across electoral, political, digital and organizing strategies,"" its website states.
""The coalition calls on candidates for federal office to take the Reject AIPAC Pledge to not take endorsements or contributions from AIPAC and/or aligned PACs.""
Reject AIPAC's strategy revolves around connecting grassroots organizations behind a seven-figure ""electoral defense campaign"" to shield the progressive lawmakers targeted by AIPAC, the Associated Press reported.

"March 14, 2024 9:58am EDT",Lauren Boebert won't 'further imperil' slim GOP majority by running in special election for Ken Buck's seat,Fox News,"Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram has the latest on how Buck's departure will further narrow the GOP majority on 'America Reports.'
Populist firebrand Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., will not run in the special election for Colorado GOP Rep. Ken Buck's seat, she declared Wednesday.
Buck stunned Republicans on Tuesday by announcing he will leave Congress on March 22, a move that triggers a special election on June 25 to temporarily fill the vacancy in Colorado's 3rd Congressional District. His early retirement will reduce the House GOP majority even further.
Boebert, who currently represents Colorado's 4th Congressional District, earlier this year announced she would run to succeed Buck in the 3rd. But on Wednesday, the congresswoman clarified she will not run in the special election to fill Buck's vacancy, as doing so would require her to vacate her own seat.
In a post on X, Boebert called Buck's announcement ""a gift to the uniparty"" and claimed establishment Republicans were attempting to ""rig"" an election ""I'm winning by 25 points.""

""Forcing an unnecessary Special Election on the same day as the Primary Election will confuse voters, result in a lameduck Congressman on day one, and leave the 4th District with no representation for more than three months. The 4th District deserves better,"" Boebert said.
""I will not further imperil the already very slim House Republican majority by resigning my current seat and will continue to deliver on my constituents’ priorities while also working hard to earn the votes of the people of Colorado’s 4th District who have made clear they are hungry for a real conservative,"" she continued.
""I am the only Trump-endorsed, America First candidate in this race and will win the 4th District’s Primary Election on June 25th and General Election on November 5th.""

Buck will leave Congress after serving in the House of Representatives since 2014. He is currently assigned to the House Judiciary Committee and Foreign Affairs Committee.
Though he holds a conservative voting record, Buck has demonstrated an independent streak that has at times put him at odds with other Republicans.
Buck was one of three House Republicans who opposed the impeachment of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.

Instead of seeking re-election to Colorado's 3rd Congressional District, Boebert announced in December that she would be running for the House seat that's being vacated by Buck. Boebert claimed the decision to hold a special election to fill Buck's vacancy on the same day as the GOP primary was an ""establishment"" attempt to ""rig"" the election. (Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)
After his resignation, the breakdown of Congress will be 431 members with 218 Republicans and 213 Democrats. The GOP will only be able to lose two votes of their own on any given issue.
The next special election is for the seat occupied by former Rep. Brian Higgins, D-N.Y., on April 30.

If that seat stays in Democratic hands, the new breakdown is 432 members with 218 Republicans and 214 Democrats. That would mean the margin would effectively be one seat for the GOP.
Should the GOP lose just two votes there is a tie, and by rule, the vote will fail in the House.

"March 14, 2024 3:35am EDT",Hunter Biden's ex-business partner Tony Bobulinski slams him for 'running away' from House Oversight Committee,Fox News,"Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., tells 'Hannity' why he invited Hunter Biden and three of his business associates to appear at a public hearing.
Hunter Biden’s former business partner, Tony Bobulinski, has criticized the president’s son for ""running away"" from the American people after he declined to appear for a congressional hearing next week.
Hunter Biden declined an invite from Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., to attend the House Oversight Committee hearing on March 20, when committee members of both parties will get a chance to ask about alleged influence peddling and the Biden family's business dealings, his lawyer said in a letter Wednesday.
""One week from today — on Wednesday, March 20 — I will testify publicly before the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability,"" Bobulinski responded in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""I was disappointed to see the news today that Hunter is running away from his chance to tell the American people the truth. He’s been adamant in wanting to go before the American people, and Oversight is now giving him that opportunity.""
Bobulinski added: ""Now is the time to step up, Hunter, as you have said you want to do. Don’t cower in the face of accountability and in this fight for truth and democracy!""

Bobulinski previously testified that President Biden ""enabled"" Hunter Biden to sell access to America's ""most dangerous adversaries,"" including China and Russia.
In his statement, Hunter Biden’s former business partner called for ""truth and transparency"" to prevail.
""Joe Biden and Hunter Biden, along with countless members of Congress, keep claiming that they are 'fighting for our Democracy.' Why don't we as a nation agree to fight for the truth!"" Bobulinski said. ""Nearly three-quarters of the American people believe the country is headed in the wrong direction, and I can’t blame them. Truth and transparency would help expose the rot at the center of our political system and begin to fix what ails us.""
""I am excited and happy to have the opportunity to once again share the facts with the American people. I am deeply committed to getting the full truth before the nation,"" he said, calling for the witnesses in the hearing, including himself, to be subject to a polygraph with ""real time results to be viewed by the American people.""
HUNTER BIDEN REFUSES TO ATTEND HOUSE HEARING WITH FORMER BUSINESS ASSOCIATES
""What better way to ensure that the truth is being told by every witness, including Joe, Hunter and Jim Biden in any future potential hearings?"" he asked.

Bobulinski also openly offered to appear before the committee for an additional hearing whenever it is convenient for Hunter Biden.
""If by chance March 20th really doesn't work due to your multiple criminal indictments, please name the date and time and I will be happy to join you at a second hearing for the American people,"" he wrote.
In addition to Hunter Biden and Bobulinski, the House Oversight Committee invited Devon Archer and Jason Galanis to testify at the 10 a.m. hearing on March 20.

On Wednesday, Hunter Biden's attorney Abbe Lowell criticized the hearing as a ""carnival side show.""
""To begin, even if that hearing was a legitimate exercise of congressional authority, neither Mr. Biden nor I can attend because of a court hearing the very next day in California,"" Lowell said in a letter sent to Comer. ""The scheduling conflict is the least of the issues, however.""
""Your blatant planned-for-media event is not a proper proceeding but an obvious attempt to throw a Hail Mary pass after the game has ended,"" Lowell wrote.
""Mr. Biden declines your invitation to this carnival side show,"" the attorney concluded.

Comer responded Wednesday, saying his committee has ""called Hunter Biden's bluff.""
""Hunter Biden for months stated he wanted a public hearing, but now that one has been offered alongside his business associates that he worked with for years, he is refusing to come,"" Comer said.

House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., invited Hunter Biden, Tony Bobulinski, Devon Archer and Jason Galanis to testify at a public hearing on March 20 at 10 a.m.
All four individuals have already testified behind closed doors as part of the impeachment inquiry, but Comer said the public hearing would ""examine inconsistencies among the witnesses’ testimonies in order to get the truth for the American people.""
But on Wednesday, Biden attorney Abbe Lowell sent a letter to Comer, blasting the hearing and the investigation altogether, and rejecting the invitation to what he called a ""carnival side show.""

""To begin, even if that hearing was a legitimate exercise of congressional authority, neither Mr. Biden nor I can attend because of a court hearing the very next day in California,"" Lowell said. ""The scheduling conflict is the least of the issues, however.""
""Your blatant planned-for-media event is not a proper proceeding but an obvious attempt to throw a Hail Mary pass after the game has ended,"" Lowell continued.
Lowell reminded Comer of a statement he made in January when he said: ""All we need are people to come in for the depositions and then we’ll be finished. We just need people to show up to the depositions and we’ll wrap this up. Nobody wants to wrap this up more than I do.""
Lowell said his client, the president's son, ""did just as you asked and, as you did when you announced that witnesses could choose depositions, you want to ignore what you said.""
""I must confess my surprise by your hasty request,"" Lowell wrote. ""After that six-plus hour deposition on February 28, 2024, along with the realization that your inquiry was based on a patchwork of conspiracies spun by convicted liars and a charged Russian spy, I thought even you would recognize your baseless impeachment proceeding was dead.""

Lowell said that ""even before Mr. Biden testified, witness after witness undermined the central premise of your partisan charade.""
""President Biden has done nothing wrong and certainly nothing, even in your misapplication of the impeachment provisions of the Constitution, to warrant further proceedings,"" Lowell said.
HUNTER BIDEN ADMITS HE PUT HIS FATHER ON SPEAKERPHONE, INVITED HIM TO MEETINGS, BUT DENIES 'INVOLVEMENT'
Lowell added that Hunter Biden's answers to questions during his deposition ""were the final nail in the coffin of your wasteful year-long misadventure.""
""As Mr. Biden said numerous times, backed up by an accurate reference to the records in the Committees’ possession, his father was never involved in or derived any financial benefit from Mr. Biden’s businesses,"" Lowell said. ""Your allegations of any wrongdoing by anyone comes only from your taking a word, phrase, or line out of context in a few communications usually written by people other than Mr. Biden or when Mr. Biden explained he was in the throes of addiction.""

He added: ""In total, your entire house of cards impeachment inquiry is built on one of those isolated texts, a drop-by hello at a dinner where Mr. Biden was pitching support for the World Food Program, a handshake hello in the lobby of a hotel, one of your colleagues not knowing the difference between ‘having a meeting’ and ‘meeting’ someone, Mr. Biden’s father chipping in to pay his share of a family bill, or Mr. Biden’s uncle paying back a loan he owed.""
Lowell said all of that is ""far from the ‘smoking guns’ you claim,"" and said ""the ‘evidence’ does not amount even to droplets from a water pistol.""
Meanwhile, as for the March 20 hearing, Lowell said it is ""not a serious oversight proceeding.""
""It is your attempt to resuscitate your Conference’s moribund inquiry with a made-for-right-wing-media, circus act,"" he said. ""Your idea of congressional ‘fact-finding’ is, amazingly, to have Mr. Biden appear with the discredited ‘witnesses’ you continue to promote.""
JOE BIDEN 'ENABLED' FAMILY TO SELL ACCESS TO 'DANGEROUS ADVERSARIES,' TONY BOBULINSKI TESTIFIES
Lowell went on to blast Bobulinski and Galanis, claiming they have lied.
""Mr. Biden declines your invitation to this carnival side show,"" Lowell wrote.
Comer responded Wednesday, saying his committee has ""called Hunter Biden's bluff.""
""Hunter Biden for months stated he wanted a public hearing, but now that one has been offered alongside his business associates that he worked with for years, he is refusing to come,"" Comer said. ""During our deposition and interview phase of our investigation, Hunter Biden confirmed key evidence, including evidence that his father, President Joe Biden, lied to the American people about his family’s business dealings and in fact attended meetings, spoke on speakerphone, and had coffee with his foreign business associates who collectively funneled millions to the Bidens.""
But Comer again said that parts of the first son's testimony ""contradict the testimonies"" of Archer, Galanis and Bobulinski.
""Next week’s hearing with Hunter Biden and his associates is moving forward and we fully expect Hunter Biden to participate,"" Comer said. ""The American people demand the truth and accountability for the Bidens’ corruption.""
Comer, appearing on Fox News Channel Tuesday, also accused the White House of ""colluding with the mainstream media,"" saying his committee didn't receive the Lowell letter ""for over an hour.""
""I'm shocked because all I've heard from Hunter Biden is that he wanted to come and have a public hearing and now we have a venue for a public hearing and he's declining to come,"" Comer said. ""The media attacked me for weeks because we wouldn't allow him to testify in public. Well, now we are. What's the media going to do now?""
Comer had subpoenaed Hunter Biden for a deposition scheduled for early December, but the president's son defied that subpoena for a closed-door deposition, demanding a public hearing instead. Comer vowed to give Hunter Biden that public hearing after the committee had him for a deposition--like all other witnesses.
""When you're investigating a family for this level of corruption you deserve the truth, the American people deserve the truth,"" Comer said. ""We're giving Hunter Biden a venue to testify publicly.""
He added: ""I think he'll be there. We expect him to be there and we look forward to seeing him next week.""

Hunter Biden appeared for a highly-anticipated deposition last month before both the House Oversight and Judiciary committees and maintained that his father was never involved in and never benefited from his businesses.
The committee also heard testimony from James Biden, the president’s younger brother, who testified the same.

Hunter Biden did admit, however, that he put his father on speakerphone with his business associates and invited him to drop by his business lunches.

And Bobulinski testified he personally met with Joe Biden in 2017 for more than 45 minutes. He also testified that Joe Biden ""enabled"" his son Hunter to sell access to America's ""most dangerous adversaries,"" including the Chinese Communist Party, Russia and more.

Meanwhile, Galanis, who is serving a 14-year sentence, testified from prison that Joe Biden was allegedly considering joining the board of a joint venture created by Hunter Biden and his business associates with ties to the Chinese Communist Party after he left the vice presidency.
Galanis also said that the words ""lean in"" were ""used often by Devon and Hunter in our business dealings as a term for access to Vice President Biden’s political influence.""
Bobulinski told Fox News Digital he will attend the hearing on March 20, regardless of whether Hunter Biden attends.

"March 5, 2024 3:00am EST",How left and right justices found common ground in restoring Trump to the ballot,Fox News,"Fox News anchor Shannon Bream has the latest on the ruling that the 14th Amendment does not allow states to strip candidates from the ballot on 'Special Report.'
Let’s cut through the legal jargon: the Supreme Court yesterday did the only thing it could do, and did it unanimously.
The justices rejected the notion that a Colorado court – all-Democratic appointees – could simply kick Donald Trump off the ballot. Just on the face of it, the idea was ludicrous, absurd and anti-democratic, and the court explicitly banned any other state from trying such a stunt.
On Sunday’s ""Media Buzz,"" I was griping about the fact that the justices were taking so long, and said they must be honing their opinions and concurring opinions. That turned out to be the case.
In the unsigned opinion, all nine justices declared that ""nothing in the Constitution requires that we endure such chaos – arriving at any time or different times, up to and perhaps beyond the inauguration.""

While legal observers say the court moved at rocket speed, the ruling came on the last day before voters in Colorado head to the polls, along with those in the other Super Tuesday states.
Much of the back and forth had to do with the 14th Amendment, but put that aside for a moment.
When Colorado’s court first made its ruling, a veritable army of anchors, correspondents and legal analysts, especially on MSNBC, cheered the move, saying Trump was finally being held accountable for fomenting the Capitol riot.
Many of the anti-Trumpers wanted more states to remove the former president from their ballots – as Maine’s Democratic secretary of state did, followed by an Illinois judge late in the game.
LIBERAL PUNDITS, URGING BIDEN TO WITHDRAW, PUSHING CONVENTION SCENARIO
That means they were all taking a hard-line stance that has now been rejected Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson. That should tell us something: Who’s more out of step with the country?
Trump, stepping before the cameras at Mar-a-Lago, calling the ruling a step toward national unity:
""They worked long. They worked hard. And frankly, they worked very quickly on something that will be spoken about a hundred years from now and 200 years from now. Extremely important.""
Trump then pivoted to the other case the Supreme Court just took, his claims of total unity for actions taken while president. The legal pundits say SCOTUS may well rule against him on that one, though no one knows for sure, which would amount to a split decision on the two high-stakes cases.
Trump was soon doing the greatest hits, attacking such prosecutors as Jack Smith, Letitia James and Fani Willis, and slamming the judges hearing several of his cases.
A New York Times reporter said that Mario Nicolais, attorney for the Colorado side, said the Supremes had ""abrogated their responsibility to our democracy….I hope that the cowardice of the court today doesn’t lead to bloodshed tomorrow."" Pretty gracious, huh?
Remember, Kagan, Sotomayor and Jackson found common ground with Sam Alito, Brett Kavanaugh and Clarence Thomas, but the critics are still carping.

Roberts, Jr., and Associate Justices Ketanji Brown Jackson, Samuel A. Alito, Jr., Elena Kagan, and Brett M. Kavanaugh. (Collection of the Supreme Court of the United States via Getty Images)
Jim Acosta, the anti-Trump CNN anchor, said his antagonist ""has sort of played the legal system like a fiddle over the last couple of years. He’s thrown the kitchen sink into the gears of America’s judicial system.""
Maine GOP director Jason Savage told the Times that his goal is replacing Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, the Democrat who ruled in December that Trump was ineligible for the Maine ballot: ""One bureaucrat was trying to alter the presidential election based on her opinion.""
What triggered the entire battle was Colorado dusting off an obscure, little-used legal provision passed after the Civil War: Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. It was aimed at former Confederate officials and soldiers who had rebelled against the country.
MEDIA DEEM TRUMP THE NOMINEE, DESPITE HALEY TYING HIM TO PUTIN
Where some of the justices parted company was over the scope of the unsigned opinion, with the court’s three liberal members saying in concurring opinions that the conservative majority went too far in attempting ""to insulate the court"" and Trump from ""future controversy….
""In a sensitive case crying out for judicial restraint, it abandons that course.""

Some of the conflicting views involve whether only Congress has the power to utilize Section 3 and whether the president is considered an officer of the United States.

Justice Amy Coney Barrett agreed with the liberals, saying the majority should not have raised ""the complicated question whether federal legislation is the exclusive vehicle through which Section 3 can be enforced…
""This is not the time to amplify disagreement with stridency … Particularly in this circumstance, writings on the court should turn the national temperature down, not up.""
However you slice and dice it, it was a big win for Donald Trump, and for those who believe the voters, not partisan state officials, should get to pick the president.

House Republican leaders are blasting Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and demanding he apologize for urging Israel to hold new elections while criticizing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
The top four GOP lawmakers held an impromptu press conference during their annual retreat this year at the Greenbrier Resort in West Virginia, immediately after Schumer’s statement.
""As we were in a work session here within the last half hour, there was a buzz among the audience as people were seeing notices come across their phone as something that was rather shocking to us,"" Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said.
""We saw the remarks from Sen. Chuck Schumer calling for new elections in Israel. And we want to speak very clearly and concisely to say that this is not only highly inappropriate, but just plain wrong for an American leader to play such a divisive role in Israeli politics, while our closest ally in the region is in an existential battle for its very survival.""
WORLD, UN SIGNAL NO EXIT FOR CIVILIANS CAUGHT UP IN GAZA WAR: 'POLITICALLY TOXIC'
House GOP leadership held an impromptu press conference just after Senate Majority Leader Schumer's Israel comments.
House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., said Schumer’s comments were ""disturbing"" in the wake of Hamas’ Oct. 7 surprise attack on Israel, in which terrorists invaded the southern part of the country and killed over 1,200 people – mainly civilians.
""Sen. Schumer owes an apology to the people of Israel, who elected their leadership,"" Scalise said. ""This isn't a time for games. This is a time to stand with our friends who are under attack and show no daylight between the United States and Israel.""
House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., accused Schumer and fellow Democrats of choosing Hamas over Israel.
""Our Democrats, Chuck Schumer, et al., the White House, they have a problem. But it's not with Netanyahu. It is with the anti-Israel members of their own party that have taken over the woke left. While they choose Hamas, House Republicans will continue to stand with Israel,"" Emmer said.

They left without taking questions from reporters. It comes just as House Republicans are expected to hear from Israeli Ambassador Michael Herzog at their multi-day retreat.
Back in Washington, Schumer took to the Senate floor on Thursday morning, where he condemned both Hamas and Israel for the high death toll of Palestinians and the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza as Israel responds to the Oct. 7 attack.
He called on Palestinians to throw off their leader, President Mahmoud Abbas, and for Israelis to demand a new election to elect a less ""radical"" government.

""Hamas and the Palestinians who support and tolerate their evil ways, radical right-wing Israelis in government and society, President Abbas, Prime Minister Netanyahu – these are the four obstacles to peace, and if we fail to overcome them, then Israel and the West Bank and Gaza will be trapped in the same violent state of affairs they’ve experienced for the last 75 years,"" Schumer said.

""These obstacles are not the same in their culpability for the present state of affairs. But arguing over which is the worst stymies our ability to achieve peace.""

"February 21, 2024 3:00am EST","Liberal pundits, urging Biden to withdraw, pushing convention scenario",Fox News,"Biden’s memory, NATO, Migrant crisis
A growing number of left-leaning pundits are hopping off the Biden train and they’re trying to come up with a plan to enable the president to jump off as well.
The attacks from the right are one thing, but these are Joe Biden’s people, who say he’s been a good president, who say he’s accomplished a great deal, but who say his age renders him either too likely or too certain to lose to Donald Trump. It’s the one problem he can’t fix.
At the same time, a new report says the Resistance is growing frustrated and burned out.
Nate Silver, the data guru and hardly a right-winger, says: ""Personally, I crossed the rubicon in November, concluding that Biden should stand down if he wasn’t going to be able to run a normal re-election campaign — meaning, things like conduct a Super Bowl interview. Yes, it's a huge risk and, yes, Biden can still win. But he's losing now and there's no plan to fix the problems.""
MEDIA DEEM TRUMP THE NOMINEE, DESPITE HALEY TYING HIM TO PUTIN

After noting that an improving economy hasn’t helped him, Silver says ""it’s become even clearer that Biden’s age is an enormous problem for him. As many as 86% of Americans say he’s too old in one poll, though numbers in the 70-to-75% range are more common — still an overwhelming majority in a bitterly-divided country.""
And that wasn’t helped by the special counsel’s report calling him an elderly man with a poor memory.
""But even the most optimistic Democrats, if you read between the lines, are really arguing that Democrats could win despite Biden and not because of him. Biden is probably a below-replacement-level candidate at this point because Americans have a lot of extremely rational concerns about the prospect of a Commander-in-Chief who would be 86 years old by the end of his second term. It is entirely reasonable to see this as disqualifying.""
Wait, there’s more.
FANI WILLIS IS IN A ‘DANGEROUS SPOT’: JACQUI HEINRICH
""I can now point you to moments when he is faltering in his campaign for the presidency because his age is slowing him. This distinction between the job of the presidency and the job of running for the presidency keeps getting muddied, including by Biden himself. And what I think we’re seeing is that he is not up for this. He is not the campaigner he was, even five years ago…The way he moves, the energy in his voice.""
Ezra Klein, the uber-liberal New York Times podcaster, also wants the president out.
""Step one, unfortunately, is convincing Biden that he should not run again. That he does not want to risk being Ruth Bader Ginsburg — a heroic, brilliant public servant who caused the outcome she feared most because she didn’t retire early enough.""
Despite what he called the ""Kamala Harris problem,"" Klein says to assume that Biden steps aside. ""Then what? Well, then Democrats do something that used to be common in politics but hasn’t been in decades. They pick their nominee at the convention.""
Silver agrees with this scenario as well.
I’m here to tell you, barring a major health scare, that’s not happening. Biden has been running for president since 1987 (I did a long interview with him during that campaign). He finally got the job. He likes being in charge. He’s not going to walk away.

And in fairness, Biden has made adjustments in the last two weeks. He now takes on-camera questions from reporters almost every day, sometimes longer than others. Just yesterday, he walked over to say, in the wake of Alexei Navalny’s murder, he’d be announcing a package of sanctions against Russia on Friday. And he’s given two televised speeches.
Still, liberal Times columnist Michelle Goldberg has been arguing since 2022 that Biden should step aside, and without a major change in strategy, ""he should find some medical pretext to step aside in time for a replacement to be chosen at the Democratic convention.""
Moderate conservative Ross Douthat says flatly in his Times column that Biden should not be running for re-election.
As if the Times might be in danger of under-covering this issue, the paper also says that ""anti-Trump voters are grappling with another powerful sentiment: exhaustion.""
""Some folks are burned out on outrage,"" Rebecca Lee Funk, founder of the liberal activist group Outrage, told the paper.
A Pittsburgh security guard said  ""It’s crisis fatigue, for sure.""
DEMOCRATS WIN SEAT, REPUBLICANS WIN IMPEACHMENT, TWO PRESIDENTS CLASH OVER NATO
How about the right? National Review’s Noah Rothman, who thinks Biden will narrowly win, explains the grand voting shift that has the Democrats in trouble:
""Despite his self-set reputation as a lunch-pail-toting nine-to-fiver with familial roots set deep in the carbon-rich soil of Scranton, Pennsylvania, Joe Biden has presided over the hemorrhaging of his party’s support among non-college-educated voters. The Democratic Party is increasingly dominated by degree-holders…The party is pinning all its electoral hopes on driving up turnout among this relatively affluent, highly educated slice of the electorate. The big problem with that plan is that there just aren’t enough of those voters…
""In 1999, according to Gallup’s historical surveys, working-class Americans identified more as Democrats than as Republicans by 14 points. Today, that has flipped, with the GOP enjoying a 14-point advantage over Democrats among those voters. Democrats have suffered similarly with young voters: Today, only 8% more voters between the ages of 18 and 29 associate themselves with the Democratic Party than with the GOP.""
This is eye-popping for those of us who grew up with the Republicans holding the monopoly on wealthier college graduates and favoring aggressive military intervention abroad.
Rothman concludes: ""Even with Trump at the top of the ticket, Democrats appear committed to a strategy that will produce, at best, the narrowest of re-election victories.""

On the other side, meanwhile, Nikki Haley gave a South Carolina speech to declare she’s not going anywhere. Plenty of Republicans have ""surrendered"" to pressure because ""they didn’t want to be left out of the club. Of course, many of the same politicians who now publicly embrace Trump privately dread him. They know what a disaster he’s been and will continue to be for our party…I feel no need to kiss the ring. I have no fear of Trump’s retribution. I’m not looking for anything from him, my own political future is of zero concern.""
But the most important part of her appearance was when she choked up while discussing her husband (who Trump has taken vague shots at). He is a National Guardsman now serving a year-long deployment in Africa after an earlier one in Afghanistan.
""Michael is at the forefront of my mind,"" Haley said, her voice breaking. ""I wish Michael was here today, and I wish our children and I could see him tonight, but we can’t. He’s serving on the other side of the world.""
It was a striking moment because Haley is usually so scripted and disciplined. A burst of emotion in 2008 helped Hillary Clinton win the New Hampshire primary. The problem is that the press will write off Haley if Trump clobbers her in Saturday’s South Carolina primary, no matter how long she keeps campaigning.

A reporter asked Biden yesterday whether he’d rather run against Trump or Haley. He responded, ""I don’t care,"" while walking away.
But given that Haley is 52, I believe he and his advisers very much care. At 77, while projecting a much more vigorous persona, Trump is the one opponent who might help Biden neutralize the issue that most threatens his re-election campaign.

"March 14, 2024 4:00am EDT",Biden-Trump sequel underway in history-making first presidential election rematch since 1956,Fox News,"'Fox News @ Night' anchor Trace Gallagher reports on former President Trump likely clinching the 2024 GOP nomination.
Minutes after they clinched the Democratic and Republican presidential nominations, President Biden and former President Donald Trump took aim at each other as their 2024 general election rematch fired up.
""Donald Trump is running a campaign of resentment, revenge, and retribution that threatens the very idea of America,"" Biden argued in a statement as he targeted his Republican challenger.
And Trump, blasting his Democratic predecessor in the White House, charged in a social media post that Biden was ""the Worst, Most Incompetent, Corrupt, and Destructive President in the History of the United States.""
The 2024 rematch – which polls indicate most Americans are anything but enthused about – is now underway.
GAME ON: TRUMP, BIDEN, CLINCH 2024 MAJOR PARTY PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATIONS
And the general election campaign started earlier than at any point in 20 years - when then-Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts locked up the 2004 Democratic nomination in early March and faced Republican President George W. Bush.
The November showdown between Biden and Trump is the first rematch in the race for the White House since 1956, when Republican President Dwight D. Eisenhower defeated former Democratic Gov. Adlai Stevenson of Illinois as they faced off a second time.
WHERE THE 2024 PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION RACES STAND
Trump is aiming to become only the second president to serve two non-consecutive terms. That hasn't been accomplished in over 130 years, since Grover Cleveland, who won the White House in 1884 but lost re-election four years later, won back the presidency in 1892.

With over seven and a half months to go until Election Day on November 5, Trump enjoys the early edge in public opinion polling – both in most national surveys and in many of the polls in five of the six key battleground states where Biden narrowly topped Trump to win the White House in 2020.

But in another key metric – fundraising – Biden currently enjoys the upper hand.
The Biden-Trump rematch offers up stark contrasts when it comes to their style and demeanor, and on where they stand on key issues, such as the economy, health care and entitlements, immigration, abortion, foreign policy, the war in Ukraine, and America's overseas role going forward.
The 81-year-old Biden, who four years ago made history as the oldest American ever elected president, will continue to face questions about his mental and physical durability, even after last week's vigorous State of the Union address.

The president also needs to show that he can energize younger voters, progressives, and Black and Latino Americans, who are all key parts of the Democratic base. Biden is also facing primary ballot box protests - materializing in ""uncommitted"" votes - over his support for Israel in its war in Gaza against Hamas.
CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP
The former president is also dealing with plenty of problems.
Trump, who last year made history as the first president or former president to face criminal charges, now faces four major trials and a total of 91 indictments – including federal cases on his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election and on handling classified documents. There's also a $355 million civil fraud judgment that Trump is appealing. He will have to juggle his appearances in court with his time on the campaign trail.
The 77-year-old Trump will also need to court the sizable block of Republican voters who backed Nikki Haley in the GOP nomination race. The former U.N. ambassador and former South Carolina governor was Trump's last remaining rival before ending her White House campaign last week. Haley's support is shining a spotlight on Trump's weakness with suburban and highly educated voters.
Complicating matters further – the presidential rematch between Biden and Trump won't be a two-candidate race.
Democratic-turned-Independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is working to place his name on state ballots across the country. Kennedy, a longtime environmental activist and high-profile vaccine skeptic who's a scion of the famous Kennedy political dynasty, is grabbing double-digits in many general election polls.
Green Party candidate Jill Stein and progressive independent candidate Cornell West are polling in the single digits. And the centrist group No Labels is moving ahead with plans to launch a third party ""unity"" presidential ticket.
While third party and independent candidates didn't play much of a role in the 2020 presidential election, they did in the 2016 showdown between Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. And they may again in 2024.

"March 14, 2024 11:40am EDT",Schumer calls for new Israeli leader to replace Netanyahu in Senate floor speech,Fox News,"Schumer shreds Israeli prime minister in lengthy floor speech.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has called on Israel to elect a new prime minister to replace Benjamin Netanyahu in order to move towards a lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians in the form of a two-state solution.
In what was billed as a major speech on a two-state solution, Schumer said on the Senate floor on Thursday that Netanyahu was one of four obstacles to this solution.

The majority leader said he believed that ""Prime Minister Netanyahu has lost his way by allowing his political survival to take the precedence over the best interests of Israel.""
Along with Netanyahu, Schumer listed ""Hamas, and the Palestinians who support and tolerate their evil ways, radical, right-wing Israelis in government and society, [and] Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas"" as the other obstacles.

According to Schumer, who is Jewish, Israeli elections are ""the only way to allow for a healthy and open decision-making process about the future of Israel."" He added that he believed a majority of Israelis also recognize a need for change in their government.

In his reasoning for calling on elections to potentially replace Netanyahu, Schumer explained: ""He has put himself in coalition with far-right extremists like Ministers Smotrich and Ben-Gvir, and as a result, he has been too willing to tolerate the civilian toll in Gaza, which is pushing support for Israel worldwide to historic lows.""

After Schumer’s speech, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R–Ky., took to the floor and addressed the remarks of his Democratic colleague, but did not call him out by name.
""The Jewish state of Israel deserves an ally that acts like one,"" he said, condemning the call for new Israeli elections as ""unprecedented.""
""Israel's unity, government and security cabinet deserve the deference befitting a sovereign democratic country.""
The Kentucky Republican added that ""foreign observers"" who aren’t able to recognize these important distinctions should not give their own prescriptions. McConnell additionally claimed the Democratic Party’s issue is not with Netanyahu, but with the state of Israel itself.
Michael Herzog, Israeli Ambassador to the U.S., posted his reaction to the news on X, formerly Twitter:
""Israel is a sovereign democracy. It is unhelpful, all the more so as Israel is at war against the genocidal terror organization Hamas, to comment on the domestic political scene of a democratic ally. It is counterproductive to our common goals.""

As recently as January, Netanyahu rejected the prospect of two states, claiming, ""I will not compromise on full Israeli security control over all the territory west of Jordan — and this is contrary to a Palestinian state.""
The Palestinian Authority has also reiterated its desire for the territories of Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem, with Jerusalem as the capital.

"March 14, 2024 1:42pm EDT",$12B in earmarks: Congress' roller-coaster history with earmark spending takes another twist,Fox News,"Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram has the latest on the spending bill push on 'Special Report.'
6,628. That’s the number of earmarks bipartisan House and Senate lawmakers tucked into the $467 billion minibus spending bill which just passed last week. The funding plan covers six areas of federal spending – averting a partial government shutdown through Sept. 30.
Earmarks totaled $12.7 billion of that spending package, a little less than 3%.
Is this pork barrel spending? Government waste? Or are lawmakers simply doing the nation’s business – in the public interest?
Earmark defenders argue that Congress is simply adhering to the Constitution.
Article I, Section 9 of the Constitution states that ""No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.""
Now to be clear, not all congressional appropriations are earmarks. But all earmarks are part of appropriations bills. That’s why earmarks are in the eye of the beholder.
Earmark defenders argue that Congress is simply adhering to the Constitution. (Win McNamee/Getty Images)
Let’s start by establishing a definition for a congressional earmark: It’s a specific amount of money for a specific project at a specific place.
MEMBERSHIP HAS ITS PRIVILEGES FOR DISGRACED EX-REP GEORGE SANTOS
Earmarks got a bad name in the mid-2000s. There were multiple ethics investigations in the House. And there was a federal corruption probe into the late Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, and the late Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska. The feds convicted Stevens on corruption charges related to accepting improper gifts. A court later reversed Stevens’ conviction. Investigators also looked at Young – but never charged him.
Young faced criticism for the mother-of-all-earmarks: the so-called ""Bridge to Nowhere."" At the time, Young chaired the House Transportation Committee. He tacked on an earmark requiring that the government spend $175 million to connect Gravina Island and Ketchikan, Alaska. The bridge was intended to replace an auto ferry. After much consternation – and a nationwide controversy – lawmakers stripped the earmark.
That’s what prompted Republicans – and then Democrats – to impose a ban on earmarks. Former President Obama even warned that he would not sign any bill which included earmarks.
So, there was a moratorium on such set-aside programs. But Democrats ended the freeze in 2021. Republicans then enthusiastically joined.
And so earmarks are back in full force.
About $1 million for a coffee shop and greenhouse for refugees in Minnesota. Another million bucks designated for organic dairy farmers in San Francisco. And $3.5 million for a new headquarters where they build floats for the annual Thanksgiving Day parade in Detroit.

""These earmarks are like cocaine,"" said Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo. ""I mean, it’s like spending crack. It’s just got to stop.""
Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., argued that lawmakers should be ashamed of authoring earmarks.
""I think if senators had to go to the floor and defend some of these (earmarks) they do, they might then think they wouldn’t have offered them,"" said Marshall.
But many lawmakers who earmark are proud to earmark.
Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., is one such lawmaker.
""Everything from infrastructure to criminal violence abatement,"" said Durbin. ""All I insist on is full disclosure of everything.""
Rep. Jack Bergman, R-Mich., is also willing to earmark.
""What we look for is community projects. That's going to update sewer systems. Wastewater systems. Bridges. Things that involve safety and quality of life for our citizens,"" said Bergman. ""Not some pork barrel project.""
For his efforts, Bergman scored multiple earmarks in the minibus bill.
The city of Ironwood, Michigan, in the Upper Peninsula, notched $481,000 for new emergency and rescue equipment. And there was $770,000 to expand classrooms at the Traverse City, Michigan, YMCA.
But lots of earmarks are still contentious.
Sens. Bob Casey, D-Pa., and John Fetterman, D-Pa., and Rep. Brendan Boyle, D-Pa., initially requested a $1,000,000 allotment for a LBGTQ community center – which is also known to host events focusing on kink.
Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., railed against that particular earmark.
""Government taxation and spending must be for the general welfare of the people,"" said Paul. ""It’s not for a sex club in Philadelphia.""
Paul applauded when Keystone State lawmakers withdrew the earmark because of the optics.
""That was a confusion within my office. I wasn’t part of that,"" said Fetterman.
The senator defended the right for people to engage in those activities. Just not on the public dime.
""To me, it’s about freedom and adults. And I don’t know why that’s really controversial,"" said Fetterman.
GOP COLORADO REP KEN BUCK TO RESIGN FROM CONGRESS BY END OF NEXT WEEK
Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, opposes earmarks. He offered amendments to remove earmarks, but without any success.
""I was told by the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, 'Sorry, no can do,’"" said Lee.
The Utah Republican then found it rich that lawmakers later struck money for the controversial community center in Philadelphia.
""They were embarrassed to defend that. So [Senate Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Patty Murray, D-Wash.,] went to the floor and had that removed.""
Sen. John Fetterman speaks to reporters before a Senate luncheon at the U.S. Capitol on Dec. 12, 2023. (Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)
And some earmarks even outlast the members who authored them. Even a dead or former lawmaker can score an earmark. Even 112 earmarks. Such was the case with late Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. Feinstein passed away late last September, one day before Congress was supposed to have spending measures approved for this fiscal year. But here we are in mid-March still wrestling with appropriations. So earmarks live on. Feinstein submitted those requests last year – sometimes alongside Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., or Reps. Salud Carbajal, D-Calif., or Jim Costa, R-Calif. This isn’t a new phenomena.
Among Feinstein’s earmark requests: money for a Chinese railroad worker history center and a fire truck for a county in northern California.
But Feinstein isn’t the only one. Former Reps. Brian Higgins, D-N.Y., and Bill Johnson, R-Ohio, resigned from Congress earlier this year. Both received earmarks – even though they left. For instance, Higgins marshaled money for a radio project with the Niagara Country, New York, Sheriff’s Department and for wind tests at the State University of New York-Amherst. Johnson also received money for sewer and water projects in Youngstown and Steubenville, Ohio.

The minibus spending bill covered six of the 12 individual appropriations bills for fiscal year 2024. But that measure only handled one-third of all ""discretionary"" federal spending. The remainder comes in another, massive six-bill tranche due at the end of next week. That accounts for two-thirds of all ""discretionary"" spending.So guess how many earmarks might wind up in that one.

"March 12, 2024 3:40pm EDT",Fox News Politics: Light Hur up,Fox News,"Welcome to Fox News’ Politics newsletter with the latest political news from Washington D.C. and updates from the 2024 campaign trail.
What's happening?
-Biden and Trump continue to mop up the remaining primaries
-Trump declares himself ‘not a Conservative’ in news interview
-Fetterman slams Democrats for not taking action against Menendez
The newly released transcript of Special Counsel Robert Hur's interview with President Biden has confirmed the president's frequent memory lapses, as well as contradicted his claims surrounding their exchange over his son Beau's death, a Fox News Digital review of the transcript has found.
Hur took fiery questions — from both sides of the aisle — during a fiery hearing Tuesday. He explained that he did not bring charges against the president despite the willful retention of classified records about military and foreign policy in Afghanistan and other countries, among other records related to national security and foreign policy, which Hur said implicated ""sensitive intelligence sources and methods.""
However, Hur affirmed that he identified evidence that ""pride and money"" were ""strong"" motivating factors for President Biden to retain classified records, as the former vice president sought to keep materials to use for a memoir he wrote that brought him $8 million.
Hur insisted that a frequent Democratic characterization of the report was false. Multiple Democrats parroted that Hur's report ""exonerated"" Biden, but Hur repeatedly told the House panel that was incorrect. When asked again if his report is a ""total and complete exoneration,"" Hur maintained ""that is not what the report says.""
Democrats took aim at Hur for the potential damage done to President Biden. Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Ga. used his allotted time during the hearing to take jabs at the Federalist Society and suggested Hur would gain personally from a Trump victory in November.
""Despite clearing President Biden from being prosecuted, you used your report to trash and smear President Biden because he said in response to questions over a five-hour interview that he didn't recall how he got the documents,"" Johnson said.
""Congressman, I reject the suggestions that you have just made. That is not what happened. Partisan politics played no part whatsoever in my work. My work was independent and fair,"" Hur hit back, speaking over Johnson as he attempted to interrupt Hur's response.

"March 14, 2024 2:22pm EDT",Lawmakers blast Biden Gaza port plan as political move to win back progressives,Fox News,"U.S. officials announced last week the construction of a pier off Gaza for large-scale aid deliveries to the territory by sea.
House Republicans are accusing President Biden of building a temporary aid port for Gaza in a bid to win back progressive voters ahead of November, and they're worried it will put American lives at risk.
Biden unveiled a plan to build a temporary floating port off the coast of Gaza to deliver humanitarian aid to Palestinians who were displaced as a result of the war between Israel and Hamas.
International groups and several nations have raised concerns about the spread of famine and disease while struggling to get food and medical aid to the population there.
The initiative is expected to take several weeks, and it still remains unclear what the cost would be to taxpayers.
WORLD, UN SIGNAL NO EXIT FOR CIVILIANS CAUGHT UP IN GAZA WAR: 'POLITICALLY TOXIC'

Though the administration announced it would not require American troops to set foot in Gaza, lawmakers raised concerns about their proximity to the war zone.
""It is clearly putting our troops in harm's way,"" Rep. Austin Scott, R-Ga., a member of the House Armed Services Committee, told Fox News Digital earlier this week. ""[Biden] doesn't seem to understand their hatred for the American soldiers, sailors and airmen and Marines, and if he puts them within range of Iranian proxies’ rockets, then Iranians proxy rockets are going to be flying at our people.
""I think it's got more to do with his politics and trying to appease a faction of the Democratic Party.""
Rep. Pat Fallon, R-Texas, who is also on the committee, chalked up the Gaza port plan to Michigan Democrats’ backlash against Biden in the recent primary election. Arab and Muslim leaders in the state urged voters to choose ""uncommitted"" instead of the president in protest of him not taking a harsher public stance against Israel.

""I think he's worried about losing Michigan in November, so he wants to throw [something] … to Muslim American voters, particularly in Michigan,"" Fallon said, adding the plan was ""not in our nation's best interest.""
""That aid in Gaza has been used by Hamas as currency,"" Fallon added.
A third Armed Services Committee member, Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., said, ""We’re going to be a target out there, and it will help Hamas in the end. Let Israel defeat Hamas, then let us help out with humanitarian aid. We didn’t do aid to Germany in 1944. We did it after [the Nazis] were defeated.""

Rep. Troy Nehls, R-Texas, also accused Biden of launching the Gaza port effort for political reasons.
""He's doing that, in my opinion, because he had a lot of uncommitted voters out there. These American Palestinians that could vote for him are saying, ‘What the hell, you ain't supporting us enough.’ So, he's going to try to do what government does, throw some money at it,"" Nehls said.

Biden made his announcement as the U.S. joined other countries in airdropping aid into Gaza.
""Tonight, I’m directing the U.S. military to lead an emergency mission to establish a temporary pier in the Mediterranean on the Gaza coast that can receive large ships carrying food, water, medicine and temporary shelters,"" Biden said during the State of the Union March 7. ""No U.S. boots will be on the ground.
""This temporary pier would enable a massive increase in the amount of humanitarian assistance getting into Gaza every day.  But Israel must also do its part. Israel must allow more aid into Gaza and ensure that humanitarian workers aren’t caught in the cross fire.""

"March 14, 2024 8:27am EDT",American nonprofit tied to UNRWA sued by Oct. 7 survivors for 'aiding and abetting' Hamas terrorists,Fox News,"Natalie Sanandaji, an American who survived Hamas’ assault, recounted her harrowing escape from terrorists to Fox News Digital and reacts to seeing antisemitism and pro-Palestinian protests now that she’s back in the United States.
An American nonprofit that has raised millions of dollars for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East – commonly known as UNRWA, – is being sued by 10 survivors and family members of slain victims of the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks on southern Israel who argue the U.S.-based group knowingly provided material support for Hamas and terrorist activities for years.
The lawsuit was filed earlier this month in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on behalf of Lishay Lavi, Noach Newman, Adin Gess, Maya Parizer, Natalie Sanandaji, Yoni Diller, Hagar Almog, David Bromberg, Lior Bar Or and Ariel Ein-Gal against the UNRWA USA National Committee., claiming that UNRWA USA and UNRWA are ""[i]nextricably [l]inked"" in supporting Hamas.
""501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations generally do good work. They feed the hungry, help the poor, and house the homeless. But on some very rare occasions, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization finances an international terrorist plot that kills over 1,200 innocent people,"" the lawsuit says. ""This case involves one of those rare occasions.""
More than 1,200 Israelis were killed, more than 6,900 civilians are estimated to have been injured, and hundreds more were taken hostage when Hamas launched a surprise attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.
WHITE HOUSE PREPARING IN CASE CONGRESS MAKES UNRWA FUNDING PAUSE PERMANENT
From 2009 to 2024, a little under $4 billion in taxpayer money was given to the humanitarian relief organization, according to a Fox News Digital review. (Mahmoud Issa/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)
""During this attack, Hamas terrorists brutally beat, tortured, raped and murdered men, women, and children. But Hamas did not carry out these attacks alone. Rather, they were financed and aided by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) and Defendant UNRWA USA National Committee, Inc. (""UNRWA USA""),"" the suit says.
Earlier this year, the Israeli government accused 12 UNRWA employees of having directly participated in the Oct. 7 attacks, prompting the U.S. and at least a dozen other countries to temporarily suspend funding to the agency amid a United Nations investigation.
But Mark Goldfeder, one of the attorneys for the plaintiffs, told Fox News Digital that UNRWA USA did not suspend sending money to UNRWA until March 1.
""Way too little, way too late. They funded it up until the point, even after the reports came out of UNRWA staff literally participating in the massacre,"" Goldfeder said Wednesday. ""Even after the United States suspended its own UNRWA donations, even after all of that, they continued fundraising, and they continued sending money.""

""This is the largest private donor to UNRWA, and they have been materially and knowingly, actively, systematically using their quote unquote, charity, to operate a terrorist financing scheme in violation of federal law,"" Goldfeder said. ""And it's gotten to the point where the evidence is so overwhelming that even UNRWA USA has now suspended donations to UNRWA because they couldn't deny it publicly anymore, but they knew all along what they were doing, and they need to be held accountable."" The complaint alleges that UNRWA USA ""has been and is fully aware that UNRWA works with and for Hamas, providing operational and financial support for their activities, and UNRWA USA aids, abets, and provides material support for those activities under the guise of humanitarian assistance.""
""UNRWA USA collects donations in the United States and then transfers nearly all its funds to UNRWA, which has significant operations in the Gaza Strip,"" the lawsuit says. ""Once the funds reach the Gaza Strip, UNRWA redistributes those funds to Hamas members on their payroll, some of whom are directly engaged in acts of terrorism, including but not limited to, the October 7th atrocities; to schools that are used to store Hamas’s weapons and other equipment; and to the production of educational materials that promote violence against Jews, including the destruction of the state of Israel.""
Fox News Digital reached out to UNRWA USA for comment on the lawsuit, but they did not immediately respond.
AMERICAN SURVIVOR OF HAMAS ATTACK ON MUSIC FEST RETURNS TO SEE ANTI-ISRAEL PROTESTS IN US: 'I DON'T FEEL SAFE'
The lawsuit alleges that UNRWA USA ""raises and transfers such funds knowingly, willfully, and with the intention that the funds be used by a designated foreign terrorist organization and its members for terrorist purposes"" and ""knowingly, willfully, and intentionally works directly and indirectly in confederation and agreement with UNRWA, Hamas, and other terrorist organizations to provide material support to the designated foreign terrorist organizations and their members and for their terrorist activities.""
The complaint also states that in addition to having ""common missions, finances, and activities,"" UNRWA USA and UNRWA ""also employ overlapping staff."" It cites posts on social media platform X in which UNRWA USA described an UNRWA employee as a freelance content producer for UNRWA USA and described UNRWA employees as ""colleagues."" The lawsuit also states that UNRWA USA board member Karen AbuZayd was appointed UNRWA commissioner-general in 2005, and that in April 2006 she ""stated that she commonly met with Hamas and would continue to do so.""
The plaintiffs accuse UNRWA USA of violating the Anti-Terrorism Act and the Alien Tort Statute.
A group of seven Republican senators penned a letter to U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland last month demanding the Justice Department open a criminal investigation into UNRWA USA, its principals and its leadership ""for knowingly providing material support to foreign terrorist organizations, including Hamas.""
""This support facilitated and continues to facilitate terrorism, including the October 7 terrorist attack,"" the letter penned by Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, Marco Rubio, R-Fla., Roger Marshall, R-Ks., Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., Rick Scott, R-Fla., Pete Ricketts, R-Nebraska, and Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., said.
According to its 2021 annual report, UNRWA USA dispersed nearly $5 million in donations to UNRWA that year, making the organization UNRWA’s largest institutional donor. In 2004, the senators also noted, the then-UNRWA Commissioner-General Peter Hansen said in an interview, ""I am sure there are Hamas members on the UNRWA payroll and I don’t see that as a crime.""
""That assessment is incorrect. It is in fact a crime,"" the Feb. 15 letter from the senators said.

In tandem with the civil litigation seeking monetary damages, Goldfeder told Fox News Digital he hopes the DOJ picks up the criminal probe and holds UNRWA USA accountable.
EXPERTS SLAM LEAKED UNRWA REPORT CLAIMING ISRAEL COERCED WORKERS INTO MAKING FALSE STATEMENTS: 'RIDICULOUS'
On Feb. 13, the Senate passed a controversial $95 billion national security supplemental package to assist Ukraine, Israel and the Indo-Pacific. It contains a provision that would block funding from going to UNRWA. The Biden administration said it was waiting on the results of the United Nations’ investigation into UNRWA to decide on whether to resume funding.
Growing bipartisan opposition to the relief agency prompted the White House to explore alternative ways to provide humanitarian assistance to Gaza should Congress permanently halt UNRWA funding. The U.S. is UNRWA's largest donor, usually contributing between $300 million to $400 million annually.
Lavi, an Israeli citizen, is suing after her husband, Omri Miran, was kidnapped by Hamas terrorists on Oct. 7 and still remains held hostage. Newman’s brother, David Yair Shalom Newman, was killed by Hamas terrorists at the Nova music festival. They both are and were U.S.-Israeli dual citizens.
Diller, Parizer, Bromberg and Or, dual U.S.-Israeli citizens, and Sanandaji, a U.S. citizen visiting from New York, all managed to escape Hamas’ attack on the Nova festival after fleeing by car and foot – in some cases for hours – while under heavy gunfire and were forced to witness friends and fellow attendees being massacred. Ein-Gal, an Israeli citizen, was asleep on Zikim Beach when swarms of terrorists began infiltrating the coast by boat but managed to escape the attack alive. Gess, a U.S. citizen, and Almog, an Israeli citizen, were not home on their kibbutzes when Hamas attacked but witnessed the massacre of their community members on a shared WhatsApp group loved ones used to beg for help.
""They have been through hell. Each of them have been through their own individual hell, and they are still, many of them, in hell,"" Goldfeder said of the plaintiffs.

Around 10% of UNRWA’s Gaza employees have links to the Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad terrorist organizations, and 50% have close relatives who belong to those groups, according to UN Watch.
""UNRWA has demonstrated time and time and time again that they are utterly, morally bankrupt. UNRWA is Hamas. In 2004, they admitted that they have Hamas on their payroll and they don't think that's a crime. Well, they're wrong. Under American law, that is a crime. That's material support for terror,"" Goldfeder said.

"March 7, 2024 4:45pm EST",Fox News Politics: 5 things to watch in Biden's State of the Union,Fox News,"Welcome to Fox News’ Politics newsletter with the latest political news from Washington D.C. and updates from the 2024 campaign trail.
Follow live coverage of Biden's State of the Union address on Fox News.
One of the biggest crises of the Biden administration revolves around the southern border and the flood of immigrants entering into the country. President Biden backed a bipartisan bill to address immigration and provide additional border security funding, but many Republicans saw it as insufficient — and Biden has attempted to lay the blame on the GOP.
How Biden addresses the border, and whether he mentions Laken Riley – the student found brutally murdered in Georgia, allegedly by an illegal immigrant – will be crucial. But the White House pushed back on rumors that Biden would announce executive action related to the border during his speech.
Nearly 30 years ago, Biden's predecessor Bill Clinton said in the 1995 State of the Union address that Americans are ""rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our country"" – language that seems unthinkable coming from a Democratic president today.

Biden addresses Congress Thursday night amid growing concerns about his age and fitness for office. Republicans have long questioned Biden's mental acuity, and polls indicate many voters do as well. And some congressional Democrats reportedly worry that Biden will make mistakes during his high-profile speech tonight.
People can even place prop bets on whether Biden makes any major gaffes.
Biden's State of the Union address also comes days before a congressional hearing with Special Counsel Robert Hur — whose report on the president's mishandling of classified documents also pointed out Biden's embarrassing memory lapses. Hur is set to testify before the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday.
House Speaker Mike Johnson hopes Biden will address the economic malaise taking hold of the country, despite the administration's insistence that ""Bidenomics"" is working.
""In just three years, President Biden’s policies have rapidly accelerated American decline on every issue from the economy to national security and foreign policy. The American people don’t need empty words on a page for a reset. We need better policies and a real leader,""
The formal Republican rebuttal to Biden's address will be given by freshman Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala. Rep. Monica De La Cruz, R-Texas, will deliver the Spanish-language rebuttal.
Grappling with negative approval ratings and trailing former President Trump in the latest polling average of their general election rematch, Biden may have a golden opportunity to try and turn the narrative around with eight months to go until the November showdown.
The White House told Fox News Digital that Biden will stress the importance of ""uniting the country"" and ""saving our democracy."" He will draw a contrast between the ""MAGA Republican agenda,"" which he claims is focused on ""rewarding billionaires and corporations with big tax breaks, taking away rights and freedoms and undermining our democracy.""
First lady Jill Biden's guests for the State of the Union address on Thursday night include an Alabama woman who is seeking in vitro fertilization (IVF), Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson and United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain.
""Each of these individuals were invited by the White House because they personify issues or themes to be addressed by the President in his speech, or they embody the Biden-Harris Administration’s policies at work for the American people. The Second Gentleman, Mr. Douglas Emhoff, will also join the First Lady in the viewing box,"" her office said in a statement.
On the GOP side, members of Congress have invited ex-Hamas hostages and families of those still held in Gaza, a Cuban opposition leader, women's sports activist Riley Gaines, families of victims of the disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal, and more.

"March 14, 2024 1:33pm EDT",Israel's US ambassador slams Schumer's 'unhelpful' anti-Netanyahu speech: 'Israel is a sovereign democracy',Fox News,"Schumer shreds Israeli prime minister in lengthy floor speech
Israeli Ambassador to the United States Michael Herzog charged that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer's criticism of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's leadership is ""unhelpful"" as the Jewish state continues its war against Hamas in response to the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks that left over 1,200 dead and hundreds more taken hostage.
""Israel is a sovereign democracy. It is unhelpful, all the more so as Israel is at war against the genocidal terror organization Hamas, to comment on the domestic political scene of a democratic ally. It is counterproductive to our common goals,"" Herzog wrote on X.
The highest ranking Jewish elected official in the U.S., Schumer, D-N.Y., excoriated Netanyahu in a speech on the Senate floor on Thursday.
""I believe in his heart, his highest priority is the security of Israel,"" Schumer said. ""However, I also believe Prime Minister Netanyahu has lost his way by allowing his political survival to take precedence over the best interests of Israel.""
SCHUMER CALLS FOR NEW ISRAELI LEADER TO REPLACE NETANYAHU IN SENATE FLOOR SPEECH

""He has been too willing to tolerate the civilian toll in Gaza, which is pushing support for Israel worldwide to historic lows. Israel cannot survive if it becomes a pariah,"" Schumer added.
The speech came a day after the No. 3 Senate Republican, John Barrasso, of Wyoming, invited Netanyahu to speak at a GOP retreat in Washington. Herzog spoke in Netayahu's place due to a ""scheduling conflict,"" the New York Times reported.
Along with Netanyahu, Schumer listed ""Hamas, and the Palestinians who support and tolerate their evil ways, radical, right-wing Israelis in government and society, [and] Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas"" as the other obstacles. The Senate majority leader said that Israeli elections are ""the only way to allow for a healthy and open decision-making process about the future of Israel."" He added that he believed a majority of Israelis also recognize a need for change in their government.

AMERICAN NONPROFIT TIED TO UNRWA SUED BY OCT. 7 SURVIVORS FOR 'AIDING AND ABETTING' HAMAS TERRORISTS
""The Netanyahu coalition no longer fits the needs of Israel after Oct. 7. The world has changed – radically – since then, and the Israeli people are being stifled right now by a governing vision that is stuck in the past,"" Schumer said.
He promoted a two-state solution with a ""a demilitarized Palestinian state living side by side with Israel in equal measures of peace, security, prosperity and dignity.""
""As a democracy, Israel has the right to choose its own leaders, and we should let the chips fall where they may,"" Schumer said. ""But the important thing is that Israelis are given a choice. There needs to be a fresh debate about the future of Israel after Oct. 7.""

As recently as January, Netanyahu rejected the prospect of two states, claiming, ""I will not compromise on full Israeli security control over all the territory west of Jordan – and this is contrary to a Palestinian state."" The Palestinian Authority has also reiterated its desire for the territories of Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem, with Jerusalem as the capital.

After Schumer’s speech, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R–Ky., took to the floor and addressed the remarks of his Democratic colleague, but did not call him out by name.
""The Jewish state of Israel deserves an ally that acts like one,"" he said, condemning the call for new Israeli elections as ""unprecedented.""
""Israel's unity government and security cabinet deserve the deference befitting a sovereign democratic country.""

"March 14, 2024 8:02am EDT",Johnson says House will 'apply every amount of pressure' to Senate to pass TikTok bill,Fox News,"Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., discusses the dangers of TikTok and why it could be banned in the United States on 'Hannity.'
Speaker of the House Mike Johnson says the lower chamber of Congress will fiercely pressure the Senate to approve the bipartisan bill targeting TikTok.
The bill — which would force Chinese company Bytedance to divest from the social media app or ban it entirely — sailed through the House of Representatives easily yesterday with a 352-65 bipartisan vote.
Its future in the Senate is unknown, as Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has remained uncommitted to the idea of bringing it to the floor.

""Let’s see what the House does,"" Schumer told reporters on Tuesday before the bill's success in the lower chamber. ""I’ll have to consult — and intend to consult — with my relevant committee chairmen to see what their views would be.""
The overwhelming bipartisan support for the bill thus far will make it difficult for Schumer and other senators to ignore.
""We’re gonna apply every amount of pressure that we can because we think that that’s the right thing,"" Johnson told the New York Post just hours after the successful vote.
DEFYING TRUMP, HOUSE GOP PLANS TO FORGE AHEAD WITH TIKTOK BILL THAT COULD BAN APP

President Biden has publicly stated he would sign the proposed TikTok divestment legislation if it reached his desk.
By contrast, former President Donald Trump shocked both parties by completely flipping his views on the app since his term in the Oval Office. He urged against the bill, claiming it would only empower other tech giants such as Facebook.
The bill was led in the lower chamber by House China select committee Chair Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., and ranking member Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill.

TikTok’s critics have long warned that the social media app poses a national security threat. Lawmakers have cited concerns about the Chinese government’s ability to leverage its power over Bytedance to access sensitive user data.
China hawks have also warned that the app’s popularity among young Americans gives the ruling Chinese Communist Party a platform for a mass influence campaign.

"March 13, 2024 7:39pm EDT",Hunter Biden’s federal gun charges trial slated for early June,Fox News,"Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., tells 'Hannity' why he invited Hunter Biden and three of his business associates to appear at a public hearing.
A federal judge on Wednesday ruled that the president’s son, Hunter Biden, will go on trial for federal firearms charges as soon as June 3.
U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika set the date during a telephonic hearing Wednesday, though she is still weighing several defense motions to toss out the case against Hunter Biden.
Hunter Biden, son of U.S. President Joe Biden, makes a surprise appearance at a House Oversight Committee markup and meeting to vote on whether to hold Biden in contempt of Congress for failing to respond to a request to testify to the House, on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., January 10, 2024. (REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque)
The younger Biden has pleaded not guilty to lying about his drug use when he filled out a form to buy a gun in October 2018 – a violation of federal law.

Biden has acknowledged his struggles with substance abuse during that period, including crack cocaine, but his lawyers have said he didn't break the law and another nonviolent, first-time offender would not have been charged.
HUNTER BIDEN REFUSES TO ATTEND HOUSE HEARING WITH FORMER BUSINESS ASSOCIATES
He was indicted after a plea deal that would have resolved the case without the spectacle of a trial imploded in July 2023 when a judge who was supposed to approve it instead raised more questions.

Hunter Biden's attorneys have since sought to have the case tossed out by arguing that prosecutors bowed to political pressure after the agreement was publicly pilloried by Republicans – including former President Trump – as a ""sweetheart deal.""

Prosecutors have said there's no evidence the case is politically motivated, the evidence against him is ""overwhelming"" and the immunity deal blew up with the rest of the plea deal.
Biden’s attorneys also argued that immunity provisions from the original deal are still in effect, and defense attorney Abbe Lowell pressed Judge Noreika to make a final ruling on the matter.

Noreika said she hadn't fully decided how she would handle the case's four pending motions to dismiss but wanted to ensure that time for any trial would be available on her calendar.
The legal team for lawyer Derek Hines, who represents Special Counsel David Weiss, anticipates it will take three to give days to present the Delaware gun case to a jury. Lowell said he would need two days to present his case to a jury.

Hunter Biden has also pleaded not guilty to the separate tax charges in Los Angeles alleging a four-year scheme to avoid paying $1.4 million in taxes while living an extravagant lifestyle. The trial in that case is scheduled from late June until mid-July.

"March 13, 2024 1:00pm EDT",Nickelodeon former child star exposes alleged sex abuse in bombshell documentary,Fox News,"The ""Kenan & Kel"" and ""All That"" actor, who is starring in the holiday film ""All I Didn't Want for Christmas,"" details his journey in becoming a youth pastor.
Nickelodeon dominated the children’s television space in the 1990s and 2000s, but behind the cultural phenomenon, there were troubling instances of alleged sexual harassment, abuse and a toxic work environment.
In the new Investigation Discovery four-part docuseries ""Quiet on the Set: The Dark Side of Kids TV,"" premiering March 17, former Nickelodeon stars and crew members share their negative experiences working on multiple Nickelodeon series, many of which were run by Dan Schneider.
Schneider was the network’s top creator across three decades, working with stars like Ariana Grande, Amanda Bynes, Jamie Lynn Spears, Victoria Justice, Jeanette McCurdy, Drake Bell, Josh Peck and Miranda Cosgrove.
In Bell’s case, he opened up for the first time about the alleged sexual abuse he experienced at the hands of Brian Peck, a dialogue coach and actor frequently employed by Nickelodeon.

DRAKE BELL CLAIMS SEXUAL ABUSE AT NICKELODEON BY CONVICTED SEX OFFENDER
During the series, Nickelodeon provided a statement included at the end of each episode regarding the allegations.
""In response to producers’ questions, Nickelodeon has stated it, ‘investigates all formal complaints as part of our commitment to fostering a safe and professional workplace…[W]e have adopted numerous safeguards over the years to help ensure we are living up to our own high standards and the expectations of our audience,'"" their comments reads.
Nickelodeon issued a statement to Fox News Digital regarding the alleged behaviors on past production sets.
""Though we cannot corroborate or negate allegations of behaviors from productions decades ago, Nickelodeon as a matter of policy investigates all formal complaints as part of our commitment to fostering a safe and professional workplace environment free of harassment or other kinds of inappropriate conduct,"" the statement said. ""Our highest priorities are the well-being and best interests not just of our employees, casts and crews, but of all children, and we have adopted numerous safeguards over the years to help ensure we are living up to our own high standards and the expectations of our audience.""
Below are more details of the biggest bombshells revealed in the documentary.
Bell went in-depth about the abuse he allegedly suffered at the hands of convicted sex offender Brian Peck while he was a teenager at Nickelodeon. (Christopher Polk)
Drake Bell starred on ""The Amanda Show"" and ""Drake & Josh"" during his time with Nickelodeon, where he encountered and was allegedly abused by Brian Peck (no relation to co-star Josh Peck).
Bell recalled Peck integrating himself into the young actor’s life, driving a wedge between him and his father, Joe Bell, who had been his manager.
Under Peck’s guidance, Bell’s mother took over Bell’s career, with Peck heavily involved. Peck also attended Bell’s concerts, took him on trips to Disneyland, threw him a 15th birthday party, and generally connected with his interests, which Bell feels now was ""probably a little calculated.""
Bell recalled the day the relationship went from uncomfortable to full-blown assault and abuse.

""I was sleeping on the couch where I would usually sleep, and I woke up to him … I opened my eyes, I woke up and he was sexually assaulting me. And I froze and was in complete shock and had no idea what to do or how to react,"" Bell said. ""And I had no idea how to get out of the situation. … What do I do, call my mom, ‘Hey, can you come pick me up? This just happened, I’ll sit here and wait.’ I had no car, I didn’t drive. I was 15 at this time.""
He continued, ""The abuse was extensive. And it got pretty brutal, pretty brutal. I don’t know, I really don’t know how to elaborate on that on camera really.""
When asked by a producer what he would feel comfortable talking about, Bell said, ""Why don’t you do this, why don’t you think of the worst stuff that someone can do to somebody as a sexual assault and that’ll answer your question. I don’t know how else to put it. It was not a one-time thing.""
Peck’s alleged abuse was eventually reported after he broke down to his mother over the phone about it, and she called the police.
Brian Peck was convicted of a lewd act against a child and oral copulation of a person under 16 in 2003. He spent 16 months in prison. (Albert L. Ortega)
Peck was arrested in August 2003, and court documents in the documentary show excerpts that mention lewd or lascivious acts with a child, sodomy, forcible penetration, using a foreign object, employment of minor for pornography, and oral copulation with a minor.
Bell attended Peck’s sentencing, where Peck pleaded no contest and was ordered to 16 months of jail time and to register as a sex offender.
Over time, Bell has grappled with his abuse and other struggles that came with it.
""I didn’t know how to process it, and I think that led to a lot of self-destruction and a lot of self-loathing, really. I would try and just escape with alcohol abuse, substance abuse, really just anything to escape,"" he said.
The now-37-year-old added that he’s sought treatment for his issues and ""took responsibility"" for a 2021 arrest in Ohio for charges related to ""attempted endangering [of] children.""
Bell noted that he had no issue with Schneider and recalled that after Peck's arrest, ""Really, the only person I remember being there for me was Dan [Schneider].""
A spokesperson for Schneider stated, ""Neither ‘All That’ nor ‘The Amanda Show’ were Dan's shows, they were created and produced by Tollin/Robbins. Dan was not involved in hiring Peck or [production assistant Jason] Handy [also accused of abuse] and did not know anything about what happened until he heard Peck had been arrested. Dan has not spoken to Peck since then, as what he did was unforgivingly awful. Dan did not know Handy or work directly with him.""
Nickelodeon issued a statement to Fox News Digital about Bell. ""Now that Drake Bell has disclosed his identity as the plaintiff in the 2004 case, we are dismayed and saddened to learn of the trauma he has endured, and we commend and support the strength required to come forward,"" the statement said.

At Peck’s sentencing, Bell recalled seeing a packed courtroom with people, including ""recognizable faces,"" in attendance to support Peck.
Peck also received support in the form of letters from individuals who had worked with him in the past, defending him. The letters were revealed through a petition to the court to unseal the documents in the case by producers (the case was originally sealed due to Bell being a minor at the time).
Among some of the more well-known names to write letters were James Marsden, who wrote, ""I assure you, what Brian has been through in the last year is the suffering of a hundred men.""

""SNL"" alum Taran Killam also wrote a letter, as did the late Alan Thicke, ""X-Men"" producer Thomas DeSanto, Ron Melendez, Rider Strong, Will Friedle and Kimmy Robertson.
Representatives for Marsden and Killam did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.
""Growing Pains"" star Joanna Kerns also wrote a letter of support, suggesting Peck had been subjected to temptation.
She provided the documentary team with a statement that stated, ""I have now learned that my letter of support was based on complete misinformation. Knowing what I know now, I never would have written the letter.""
The documentary makes clear it is not known what any of the letter writers were told about the situation and who was present during sentencing.
""Boy Meets World"" star Strong and Friedle recently addressed their support of Peck on their podcast, ""Pod Meets World.""

""There's no way I could have been manipulated like this because I was an adult,"" Friedle said. ""By the time I had heard what had happened, I had known this man for years and years, had no idea that any of this was going on, obviously, and the idea that now at 24 or whatever I was, 24 or 25 when I found out about it – that I didn't know, couldn't spot it – that was a failure of my own.""
Strong remembered Peck admitting to the crime but spinning the assault so that it appeared as though Peck was the victim.
""It was always in the context of, ‘I did this thing, I am guilty. I am going to take whatever punishment the government determines, but I’m a victim of jailbait. There was this hot guy. I just did this thing, and he’s underage.’ And we bought that storyline,"" Strong said.
Neither indicated if they were aware that Bell was the victim or who he was at the time.
Friedle remembered one victim's mother telling the court, ""Look at all the famous people you brought with you. And it doesn’t change what you did to my kid.""

In an interview with ""All That"" cast member Kyle Sullivan, he recalled making a disturbing discovery at Peck’s home during a party with the cast and crew.
According to Sullivan, Peck was in possession of a painting by convicted serial killer John Wayne Gacy.
""I noticed a painting in the room that stuck out to me because it had nothing to do with ‘Planet of the Apes.’ It was of a birthday clown holding balloons. And Brian got very excited when I asked him about it. He flipped the thing around, and on the back it said, ‘To Brian, I hope you enjoy the painting, Best wishes, John Wayne Gacy.’ It was a self-portrait of serial killer John Wayne Gacy,"" Sullivan recalled.
Sullivan also claimed that Peck had ""actually developed a pen pal relationship with John. He kept this pile of letters and photos from John Wayne Gacy in a nightstand next to his bed. He pulls them out and starts showing them to me.""
The actor remembered telling other people about the painting during the party, including adults, but nothing came of it.
""Your instinct is to give someone the benefit of the doubt if you’ve known them for that long,"" he said. ""Even in the face of, like, this really bad sign. It was one of those, like, [classic] failures of group psychology. This man who is, like, trusted as basically a supervisor of kids is not safe.""

Peck was not the only alleged predator on the sets of Nickelodeon series.
The second episode of ""Quiet on Set"" details the case of Jason Handy, a production assistant who often escorted the child actors around on set.
Handy was arrested in April 2003 after his home was searched and over 10,000 images of child pornography were found, as well as an incriminating journal and plastic baggies with what were described as ""tokens"" from underage girls.
A woman, identified as MJ in the documentary, spoke about the case, as her daughter, identified only as Brandi, was a victim of Handy and had once received inappropriate emails from him.
MJ noted there was ""never an apology to Brandi for what happened. Everything got swept under the rug.""

A recurring complaint against Schneider across the episodes is the apparent sexual nature of the sketches and jokes written or overseen by him.
Some scenes include actors displaying their feet in what many looked back on as suggestive, licking objects, liquids or gels thrown on actors’ faces, and other actions that all who participated in the documentary said seemed inappropriate.
Bryan Christopher Hearne, who appeared on ""All That,"" recalled being very uncomfortable filming a challenge for the show ""On Air Dare.""
""On Air Dare"" featured ""Fear Factor""-like stunts, and Hearne was tasked with being covered in peanut butter and having dogs lick it off him.

""That sound like some awkward fantasy from some freaky dude. It was really uncomfortable. I didn’t like that."" He added, ""I don’t think any of that was necessary,"" Hearne said.
""Zoey 101"" star Alexa Nikolas recalled ""one of the most disturbing memories"" of hers was filming an episode that featured her chewing on a jelly candy item that ends up squirting on the face of series star Jamie Lynn Spears.
Nikolas recalled Schneider laughing at the scene and overhearing ""the boys saying, ‘It’s a c-m’ shot,'"" not realizing the implications of the scene until she was an adult.
Schneider's spokesperson addressed the content, saying, ""Everything that happened on the shows Dan ran was carefully scrutinized by dozens of involved adults, and approved by the network. If there was an actual problem with the scenes that some people, now years later, are ""sexualizing,"" they would be taken down, but they are not, they are aired constantly all over the world today, still enjoyed by both kids and parents.""
They continued, ""Remember, all stories, dialogue, costumes and makeup were fully approved by network executives on two coasts. A standards and practices group read and ultimately approved every script, and programming executives reviewed and approved all episodes. In addition, every day on every set, there were always parents and caregivers and their friends watching filming and rehearsals. Had there been any scenes or outfits that were inappropriate in any way, they would have been flagged and blocked by this multilayered scrutiny.""
""Unfortunately, some adults project their adult minds onto kids' shows, drawing false conclusions about them. The logo at Nickelodeon used to be a foot because kids think feet are funny.""
They added, ""The ‘On-Air Dares’ were Nickelodeon’s & Tolin/Robbins’ answer to ‘Fear Factor’; they were not shows Dan created.""

Schneider ran an entire universe’s worth of shows on Nickelodeon from the mid '90s to the late 2010s, during which multiple people claimed he fostered a toxic workplace and participated in discrimination.
""The Amanda Show"" writers Christy Stratton and Jenny Kilgen both claim they were not paid fairly during their time on the show and pressured to do things like massage him on set.
Kilgen sued Schneider, with her lawyer filing complaints alleging gender discrimination, hostile work environment, harassment and pay discrimination. The matter was settled after an internal investigation, but the details were not specified in the documentary.
Other cast and crew members spoke about Schneider’s massage requests on set as well, including a costumer who chose to remain anonymous but said she reported him to her union and that the union informed her she was not the only person to complain.
Schneider's spokesperson said, ""Dan deeply regrets asking anyone for neck massages. Though they happened in public settings, he knows this was highly inappropriate and would never happen again.""
Regarding the pay discrepancies, they said, ""'The Amanda Show' was produced by a different company (Tollin/Robbins) not Dan. Additionally, Dan was not involved in writers’ salaries, they were controlled by the network and also by the WGA, not by Dan even on shows he did create.  However, unfortunately writers' rooms were often off-color places, especially more than 20 years ago. Dan is extremely sorry if his behavior contributed to that environment, and he has grown a lot since then. That behavior is clearly wrong and not for the workplace, and certainly he would never act that way again.""

In 2018, Schneider and Nickelodeon parted ways. The anonymous costumer noted that when people returned to work after his firing, ""It was a much happier workplace.""
A spokesperson for Schneider told Fox News Digital, ""Dan expected and asked a lot from his teams. They worked long hours and consistently made successful shows. In the challenges of production, Dan could get frustrated at times, and he understands why some employees found that intimidating or stressful. In a career spanning 30-plus years, Dan worked with thousands of people, many of whom still tell him how much they enjoyed and appreciated working on his shows. But he also knows some people did not have a positive experience, and he is truly sorry for that.""
Russell Hicks, former president of content and production at Nickelodeon, told Fox News Digital in a statement, ""Dan Schneider is one of the most prolific producers of hit television in the kids and family entertainment business. Dan’s shows transcend children's television and are staples on many streaming platforms today, enjoyed by both kids and their parents.""
He continued, ""Dan cared about the kids on his shows even when sometimes their own families unfortunately did not.""
Hicks also noted, ""What people seem to be forgetting is the fact that the network has a talent management department that is keeping tabs on everything that is happening and going to every event these kids go to.""
""There is a standards and practices group that reads every script and programming executives looking at every episode. Add to that every day on every set, were the parents and caregivers and their friends watching every single frame of footage and listening to every joke. Every single thing that Dan ever did on any of his shows was carefully scrutinized and approved by executives at Nickelodeon.""

""Wheel of Fortune"" fans were audibly surprised by a moment on Thursday's episode of the popular game show.
Contestant Tara Brown beat the odds twice when she managed to land on the small $1 million wedge at two different points, and both times, she failed to secure the big prize.
Fans of the show, hosted by Pat Sajak and Vanna White, know that the $1 million wedge works differently than the others – when a contestant lands on it and then correctly guesses a letter, they pick it up, and if they solve the final puzzle, then the $1 million prize will be available to win after the bonus round.

The first time Brown obtained the wedge, it was when the contestants had nearly solved a puzzle in the ""Let There Be Light!"" category. There were only two letters left before the puzzle was complete, and it read ""BULB, BEA__N, SUN, STARS.""
Sajak reminded her that she needed to ""call a letter that's in the puzzle, and she hesitantly guessed ""H?""
The audience audibly reacted in dismay, and one person could be heard crying out, ""Oh no!""
She lost out on her chance to get the coveted prize, and another contestant then correctly solved the puzzle by saying ""Bulb, Beacon, Sun, Stars.""

Later on, she managed to get a chance at the wedge once again, but she was unable to .
Viewers in the audience weren't the only ones to have a big reaction to the first flub – fans at home took to X, formerly Twitter, to react to the moment.

This reaction is a change of pace for ""Wheel of Fortune"" fans, as many complaints lately have been about the show itself.
In an episode that aired last week, fans began rallying around a contestant, insisting that she had actually named the right answer to the puzzle but that Sajak had failed to recognize it.

The contestant, a woman named Tamara, chose ""What Are You Doing?"" for the category for the final puzzle. After White turned over both the letters the show traditionally provides and the ones Tamara chose, she was left with ""___N_NG A B___ _L_B.""

An autopsy report revealed in December that Perry died from acute effects of ketamine. Coronary artery disease and buprenorphrine effects were also listed as additional conditions that contributed to his death. The actor was found dead in a hot tub at his Los Angeles home in October.

""Toward the end of his life, they were closer than I've seen them – had seen them for decades. Texting each other constantly. Him sharing things with her that most middle-aged men don't share with their mothers.""

""It's gone, but you still feel the echo of it everywhere,"" he said of Perry's presence.

""He took a look and knew immediately it needed a biopsy! He did it then and there! So make your own good luck by making that check up appointment today. And slather up my friends!""

"February 28, 2024 1:05pm EST",'Jeopardy!' under fire over 'woke' question about pronouns,Fox News,"Fox News Flash top entertainment and celebrity headlines are here.
""Jeopardy!"" fans are in an uproar over a clue presented on Monday's episode.
In the category ""Speech! Parts of Speech!,"" one of the contestants selected the $600 clue, which, as host Ken Jennings read, was ""xem, xyrs, xemself."" The same contestant buzzed in to answer ""What are pronouns?,"" and Jennings awarded him the money, saying, ""Those are pronouns, neopronouns.""
The prefix ""neo"" means ""new"" — neopronouns are new pronouns, typically ones that are used to avoid ""he"" or ""she.""
'JEOPARDY!' FANS CALL OUT CONFUSING FINAL JEOPARDY CLUE: ‘NOT THE FIRST WORD I’D USE'

The show moved on quickly, with Jennings and the contestants jumping to the next question, but many viewers were surprised to see a clue about neopronouns on the game show.
""So, in order to win at Jeopardy, you need to be able to keep up with whatever bull the wokes are coming up with?"" one person asked on X.
Another former fan said they are ""done"" with ""Jeopardy!,"" and one said that if they were asked the question, ""I would answer by turning off the television, never watching that effing show again.""
Contestant Chris correctly answered the clue about pronouns. (Jeopardy!/Sony Pictures Television)
""So much for Jeopardy,"" a complaint read. ""The woke crowd has claimed another. That's OK. I have my King James Bible to read. Like God, that will never change.""
Several viewers brought up Alex Trebek, the longtime host who died in 2020 after battling pancreatic cancer. The suggestion was that Trebek never would have agreed to such a question being presented on the show.
‘JEOPARDY!' FANS BLAST CONTESTANTS MISSING POP CULTURE QUESTIONS: ‘NONE OF THESE NERDS KNEW THE ANSWER’
""They didn’t waste time making Alex start spinning in his grave; did they?"" a fan wrote. Another asserted that ""Jeopardy died with Alex Trebek.""
One more former fan insisted, ""I will NEVER watch Jeopardy after this. After Alex, it all went downhill.""

But other fans applauded the clue. One person wrote, ""Jeopardy just had a question about neo pronouns & it's probably silly of me, but that was so exciting to see. And it wasn't treated like a joke, either.""
Another commented, ""I don’t really get the outrage on this one. It’s a good Jeopardy! question because those are a confusing example of pronouns that would take most people time to realize what part of speech they are.""

"March 13, 2024 11:52am EDT",Meghan Markle’s photographer denies ‘doctoring’ photo amid Kate Middleton’s Photoshop scandal,Fox News,"Royal reporter Neil Sean joins ‘The Story’ to discuss Kate Middleton’s post claiming her altered Mother’s Day photo was due to her amateur photographer editing skills.
Meghan Markle’s photographer hit back at claims that he edited a photo of the Duchess of Sussex when she announced her second pregnancy.
The former American actress and her husband Prince Harry were accused of adding a tree into the background of their family snap. The couple welcomed their daughter, Princess Lilibet ""Lili"" Diana Mountbatten-Windsor in June 2021.
MEGHAN MARKLE SCORES LEGAL VICTORY IN DEFAMATION LAWSUIT BROUGHT BY HALF-SISTER SAMANTHA MARKLE
Misan Harriman took to X, formerly known as Twitter, to address the allegation. He also posted the original photo on Instagram, along with the black and white image that was used as the couple's announcement.
""Hey, I’ve just got back to reality from the Oscars and unfortunately there’s been an article on the Daily Mail saying that I have admitted to doctoring the pregnancy announcement portrait I took of Harry and Meghan,"" Harriman said in a video. ""Apparently, I was switching out trees and meadows and I admitted to this in an episode of a podcast called Private Passions.""
""This is crazy,"" said Harriman. ""I was interviewed, I think it was in 2022, by Michael Berkeley on Private Passions, and we were talking about the technology I used to shoot people during lockdown. Many photographers were doing virtual shoots in those days.""
Misan Harriman photographed the Duke and Duchess of Sussex as the former American actress was expecting their second child, Princess Lilibet. (Max Mumby/Indigo)
Harriman accused Berkeley of ""leading questions"" in the interview about the couple. Harriman noted that when it comes to certain questions about the couple, he tries to ""swerve, ignore, try and get back on track and say what I’m there to say rather than any intrigue and gossip.""
During the four-minute video, Harriman played snippets of the podcast episode. During the segment, Harriman can be heard saying, ""My most well-known virtual shoot is the portrait I took of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle announcing their pregnancy."" He described it as a ""very joyous image.""
""The technology allows you to take over a phone or an iPad,"" he explained. ""They can hear my voice and I can press the shutter and compose with ease.""

The interviewer could be heard saying, ""They weren’t actually under a willow tree, were they? They were lying outside in a meadow, weren’t they?""
Harriman replied, ""Yeah they were lost in their love, at home, in their garden, comfortable, celebrating new joy. New life. The fortitude of hoping for life in life after such a loss that they went through with the miscarriage. So it was a particularly joyous image to celebrate life itself.""
Harriman then looked at the camera and said, ""How that exchange could amount to me admitting to doctoring an image is insidious and really dangerous journalism. Any mention of meadows and willow trees came from the person doing the interview. Not my mouth.""

""I did my best to ignore it and focus on what I wanted to talk about,"" he shared. ""So to see an article saying as fact that I did what I did not do is extraordinary to me. And then to try and merge it with this current news cycle of what’s happening – it’s just… tragic to see.""
""It was a virtual shoot that I shot on an iPad, an 8-megapixel iPad. And the only thing that was changed is the black and white color grade,"" Harriman explained. ""That’s it. The Daily Mail and the journalist that wrote this [accusation] has to be better than this. Dangerous and unacceptable behavior.""
The accusation came amid Kensington Palace's photo crisis, which has put Kate Middleton in the middle of a social media firestorm.

On Monday, the Princess of Wales spoke out after photo and news agencies pulled a new photo released by Kensington Palace for Mother’s Day in the U.K. due to suspicions of manipulation.
""Like many amateur photographers, I do occasionally experiment with editing,"" read a message the mother of three shared on X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram Stories.
""I wanted to express my apologies for any confusion the family photograph we shared yesterday caused,"" the 42-year-old wrote. ""I hope everyone celebrating had a very happy Mother’s Day.""

The message was signed ""C"" for Catherine.
A spokesperson for Kensington Palace, which handles the office of the Prince and Princess of Wales, didn’t immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment.
The image in question showed Middleton with her children, Prince George, Prince Louis and Princess Charlotte. As of Monday afternoon, it remains up on the Prince and Princess of Wales' X account.

""Thank you for your kind wishes and continued support over the last two months. Wishing everyone a Happy Mother’s Day,"" the caption read, signed with a ""C.""
The Associated Press and other news agencies began pulling the image from their websites over concerns that it was ""manipulated.""
""AP initially published the photo, which was issued by Kensington Palace. But AP later retracted the image because at closer inspection, it appeared the source had manipulated the image in a way that did not meet AP’s photo standards. The photo shows an inconsistency in the alignment of Princess Charlotte’s left hand,"" the news agency said.

According to AP, their ""editorial standards state that images must be accurate. AP does not use altered or digitally manipulated images.
""AP’s news values and principles explain that minor photo editing, including cropping and toning and color adjustments, are acceptable when necessary for clear and accurate reproduction and should maintain the authentic nature of the photograph.
""Changes in density, contrast, color and saturation levels that substantially alter the original scene are not acceptable. Backgrounds should not be digitally blurred or eliminated by burning down or by aggressive toning. The removal of ‘red eye’ from photographs is not permissible.""

When AP determined the photo appeared to have been manipulated, it issued what is known as a ""photo kill,"" an industry term that retracted the image and instructed clients to remove the photo from their systems.
The Associated Press also announced that ""no replacement photo will be sent."" Fox News Digital confirmed that Reuters and Getty also pulled the photo from their sites.

The caption noted that the photo was taken in ""2024"" by Middleton's husband, Prince William, who is heir to the British throne.
Middleton was previously accused of Photoshop mishaps with her family's 2023 Christmas card, which also featured her children and Prince William. In that image, Louis appears to be missing a finger.
The princess is known for photographing the official birthday portraits of her children. In 2020, she participated in a project where she photographed Holocaust survivors with their grandchildren. In 2022, she shot a portrait of Queen Camilla for the British magazine Country Life.

Speculation about Middleton’s whereabouts and health has been running wild since January when it was announced that she had been hospitalized.
A spokesperson for Middleton previously commented on the rumors, telling Fox News Digital at the end of February, ""Kensington Palace made it clear in January the timelines of the Princess’ recovery and we’d only be providing significant updates. The guidance in January stands that the Princess would be recuperating at home in Windsor.""
Recommendations from her medical team indicated that the princess would likely not resume public duties until Easter, later this month.

""The Princess of Wales appreciates the interest this statement will generate. She hopes that the public will understand her desire to maintain as much normality for her children as possible; and her wish that her personal medical information remains private,"" the original statement read. ""The Princess of Wales wishes to apologise to all those concerned for the fact that she has to postpone her upcoming engagements. She looks forward to reinstating as many as possible, as soon as possible.""
The Princess of Wales was first seen publicly in an unofficial capacity when she was spotted by photographers being driven in a car by her mother, Carole Middleton.

Roman Polanski received a trial date over sexual assault allegations of a minor in 1973.
The controversial director must face an American judge on Aug. 4, 2025, for a 10-day trial, the plaintiff's lawyer, Gloria Allred told Fox News Digital.
Allred announced during a press conference Tuesday that Polanski, 90, received the case from a process server at his home in Paris on behalf of the plaintiff, Jane Doe. Doe accused Polanski of ""childhood sexual assault"" in a lawsuit initially filed in June 2023.
It's unclear if Polanski will appear in court as he hasn't stepped foot on American soil since fleeing the country in 1977 after pleading guilty to having unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor.

""I have waited a long time to file this case against Mr. Polanski, but I finally decided to file it in order to obtain justice and accountability,"" Jane Doe said in a statement to Fox News Digital.
Following Allred's press conference, Polanski's lawyer told Fox News Digital, ""Mr. Polanski strenuously denies the allegations made against him in the lawsuit and believes that the proper place to try this case is in the courts, and not in press conferences.""
Jane Doe allegedly met Polanski at a party in 1973 when she was a minor, according to documents obtained by Fox News Digital. She claimed that he invited her to dinner knowing that she was underage. Doe alleged in the lawsuit that she met Polaski at his home in Benedict Canyon the night they were having dinner.
ROMAN POLANSKI CRIMINAL CASE TRANSCRIPTS ORDERED RELEASED, COURT RULES
She claimed that Polanski gave her two shots of tequila before they went out. He drove them to Le Restaurant on La Cienega in Los Angeles, according to the complaint. Their table was not yet ready when they arrived, so they waited at the bar where Polanski proceeded to order more tequila for them both.

Once seated at their table, ""Plaintiff began feeling dizzy from the tequila and went to the restroom where she was ill,"" documents stated. She stepped outside for fresh air, and Polanski followed her out before ""driving her back to his house.""

She woke up with the director next to her, documents stated. ""Defendant Polanski removed Plaintiff’s clothes and he proceeded to rape her causing her tremendous physical and emotional pain and suffering.""
Allred told Fox News Digital, ""In 2017, I held a press conference with Jane Doe who alleged at that time that Mr. Polanski had sexually victimized her when she was a minor and that she was ‘infuriated’ that the victim, Samantha Geimer, in Mr. Polanski’s prior criminal case asked the Court to dismiss the criminal case against Mr. Polanski after he fled California prior to being sentenced.
""Judge Scott Gordon, in rejecting the defendant’s request stated, ‘Polanski cannot avail himself of the Court while standing in contempt of it.’""

ROMAN POLANSKI ACCUSED OF 'EXTREMELY VIOLENT' RAPE OF FRENCH WOMAN IN 1975 WHEN SHE WAS 18: REPORT
Allred added, ""Although the defendant has appeared to return to business as usual in his life, our client has not been able to return to business as usual since her victimization. The criminal justice system has not yielded a just outcome for the people of California who had a right to see Mr. Polanski sentenced for his sexual crime against a child, but we look forward to our fight for justice and accountability for Jane Doe in the civil lawsuit which we have filed.""
The ""Chinatown"" director reunited with Samantha Geimer last year, the woman he pled guilty to having unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor more than 40 years ago.

Geimer was 13 years old at the time Polanski — who was in his 40s — was arrested and charged with rape by use of drugs, perversion, sodomy, providing controlled substances to a minor, and lewd and lascivious acts upon a child under 14.
Following his guilty plea in 1977, Polanski fled the country and became a fugitive, first finding refuge in London and then settling in France.
While Polanski has never stepped foot on U.S. soil or any country that would extradite him to the United States, he has still created films and won the Academy Award for best director in 2002 for ""The Pianist.""

""Let me be very clear: what happened with Polanski was never a big problem for me,"" Geimer told Polanski's wife Emmanuelle Seigner, per IndieWire. ""I didn’t even know it was illegal, that someone could be arrested for it. I was fine, I’m still fine.""
In 2018, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences voted to kick Polanski out and subsequently defended its decision by saying he was given a fair opportunity to challenge the Academy's ruling.
Polanski sued the Academy the following year on the grounds that the group had failed to follow its own procedures when it voted to kick him out. He was expelled alongside Bill Cosby for violating the organization’s standards of conduct.
In its response, the Academy said the board considered voluminous materials submitted by Polanski on appeal, including more than 400 pages of exhibits and a detailed memo from his attorney. Polanski also recorded a videotaped statement directly addressing the board of governors.

"March 11, 2024 1:58pm EDT",Sydney Sweeney wore Marc Bouwer gown also worn by Angelina Jolie to Oscars 20 years ago,Fox News,"Comedian Jimmy Kimmel targeted Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., during the Oscars, slamming the rising GOP star for her rebuttal to President Biden's State of the Union.
Sydney Sweeney stunned the carpet of the 2024 Vanity Fair Oscar Party in a gown that may have looked familiar to Oscar fans. Angelina Jolie, actress and filmmaker, wore the same dress to the Oscars 20 years ago.
The silk cream-colored dress designed by Marc Bouwer was first worn by Jolie in 2004. The gown displays a plunging neck line, an open back and a long train.
Sweeney chose to accessorize the dress similarly to Jolie's look. Sweeney accompanied the gown with the matching shawl, and a long, custom-made tiered necklaces by Messika.

2024 OSCARS: COMPLETE WINNERS LIST
Jolie paired the dress with the same shawl and a custom-made tiered diamond necklace.
One of the key differences between the actress's looks was the way their hair was worn. Jolie went with a half up, half down style, while Sweeney used the occasion to debut an old-Hollywood bob.
When Jolie wore the dress in 2004, she was not nominated for an award herself but presented the Oscar for Achievement in Art Direction. The Oscar went to Grant Major for his work in ""Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.""

In 2000, Jolie won an Oscar in the category Best Actress in a Supporting Role for ""Girl Interrupted."" In 2009, she was nominated for Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role for ""Changeling.""
Sweeney was not nominated for an Oscar, though she has had a busy year in Hollywood. She recently starred in the hit rom-com ""Anyone But You"" opposite Glen Powell. She is also one of the A-list stars in the popular TV drama ""Euphoria"" and a reoccurring cast member in the first season of the popular TV mystery, ""White Lotus.""
Sweeney was photographed with ""Euphoria"" co-star Maude Apatow as well as Billie Eilish and Camila Cabello at the highly recognized Oscar party. Sweeney also showcased the dress in a photo with ""White Lotus"" co-star Jennifer Coolidge.
It is not uncommon for celebrities to wear dresses worn by icons many years prior. One of the recent most memorable fashion moments was when Kim Kardashian wore Marilyn Monroe's dress to the 2022 Met Gala.

"March 10, 2024 8:25pm EDT",Screenwriter accuses Oscar-nominated film ‘The Holdovers’ of plagiarism before awards show,Fox News,"A look at nominees for this year's Academy Awards, announced Tuesday morning from Hollywood
A screenwriter has accused the Oscar-nominated film, ""The Holdovers,"" of plagiarizing a script he wrote more than a decade ago.
Simon Stephenson, who has worked on the films ""Luca"" and ""Paddington 2,"" outlined his allegations in emails to the Writer’s Guild of America (WGA).
Stephenson alleged that The Holdovers’ director, Alexander Payne, likely read his script ""Frisco"" when it made the rounds of Hollywood’s ""black list"" in 2013. The list refers to an annual survey of Hollywood executives’ favorite unproduced screenplays. ""Frisco"" peaked at number three.
This image released by Focus Features shows Paul Giamatti in a scene from ""The Holdovers."" (Seacia Pavao/Focus Features via AP)
In emails, obtained exclusively by Variety, Stephenson alleged that there was ""overwhelming"" evidence that The Holdovers screenplay ""has been plagiarized line-by-line"" from ""Frisco.""
""[A]nybody who looks at even the briefest sample pretty much invariably uses the word ‘brazen,’"" Stephenson said in one email to the WGA.
Stephenson went to lengths to compare the two films scene-by-scene, as well as important sequences and dialogue.
ACADEMY AWARDS DRAMA, CONTROVERSIES, SNUBS AND MORE FROM OSCARS PAST
""I can demonstrate beyond any possible doubt that the meaningful entirety of the screenplay for a film with WGA-sanctioned credits that is currently on track to win a screenwriting Oscar has been plagiarized line-by-line from a popular unproduced screenplay of mine,"" Stephenson reportedly wrote late last month.
""I can also show that the director of the offending film was sent and read my screenplay on two separate occasions prior to the offending film entering development.""
Fox News Digital has reached out to representatives of Stephenson and Payne as well as the WGA for further comment.

"March 13, 2024 3:16pm EDT",Christina Applegate ignored early MS symptoms: 'I didn't pay attention',Fox News,"Christina Applegate thanked her friends and family for taking care of her, especially her daughter, who she called 'the most important' person.
Actress Christina Applegate is discussing her ongoing battle with multiple sclerosis, detailing symptoms that she initially ignored before being formally diagnosed in 2021.
Prior to being told she had MS, Applegate remembers feeling a tingling sensation while filming the final season of her Netflix series, ""Dead to Me.""
""My symptoms had started in the early part of 2021, and it was, like, literally just tingling on my toes. And by the time we started shooting in the summer of that same year, I was being brought to set in a wheelchair. Like, I couldn't walk that far,"" she explained on ""Good Morning America"" with Robin Roberts. ""So I had to tell everybody, because I needed help.""
CHRISTINA APPLEGATE ADDRESSES FUTURE AS AN ACTRESS AMID MS DIAGNOSIS

Applegate believes she had likely been suffering from the disease for much longer, but explained how she'd ignored other symptoms. ""I probably had it for many, many years,"" she told Roberts. ""Probably six or seven years.""
""I noticed, especially the first season [of ‘Dead to Me’], we'd be shooting and I would like, buckle. Like my leg would buckle. I really just kind of put it off as being tired. Or ‘I’m dehydrated' or ‘It’s the weather,'"" Applegate noted of her dismissiveness. ""And then nothing would happen for like, months. And I didn't pay attention.""
According to the Mayo Clinic, MS ""is a potentially disabling disease of the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system)."" It ""attacks the protective sheath (myelin) that covers nerve fibers and causes communication problems between your brain and the rest of your body. Eventually, the disease can cause permanent damage or deterioration of the nerve fibers.""
Christina Applegate says friend and actress Selma Blair encouraged her to get tested for MS. Both actresses suffer from the disease. (Getty Images)
""But when it hit this hard, I had to pay attention,"" Applegate continued, of eventually seeking medical intervention. Thanks to her friend and fellow actress Selma Blair, who also battles the disease, Applegate got tested for MS.
""She goes, ‘You need to be checked for MS.’ I said, ‘No. Really? The odds? The two of us from the same movie, come on. That’s not gonna be — that doesn't happen.' She knew,"" Applegate shared of her ""Sweetest Thing"" co-star. ""If not for her, it could have been way worse.""

In a joint interview with People magazine, the women joked about the negatives of MS. ""Well, you pee… in your pants. Because you probably can’t get to the bathroom in time. So yeah, diapers,"" Applegate said, of the disease. ""And we have a bone to pick with the designers, because who wants a beautiful flower on your diaper? It should really say, ‘F--- my life,’"" Sigler joked.

As debilitating as the disease is, Applegate has clearly not lost her humor or wit. ""It sucks, it's not my favorite disease. I've had a couple,"" she told Roberts, referencing her previous diagnosis of breast cancer. ""It's not my favorite one.""
""I'm never gonna wake up and go, ‘This is awesome.’ I'm just gonna tell you that. Like it's just not gonna happen. I wake up and I'm reminded of it every day,"" she said. ""But I might get to a place where I will function a little bit better.""

"March 14, 2024 12:02pm EDT",Valerie Bertinelli moves on with new boyfriend after dramatic divorce from ex-husband Tom Vitale,Fox News,"Fox News Flash top entertainment and celebrity headlines are here.
Valerie Bertinelli has found love again.
Bertinelli, 63, recently shared that she's in a new relationship, and although she didn't give the man's name, she did say that she feels ""incredibly blessed and lucky to have met him.""
The actress, who was married to musician Eddie Van Halen from 1981 to 2007 and businessman Tom Vitale from 2011 to 2022, told USA Today that she's ""incredibly grateful"" for her new boyfriend.

""It’s unlike any relationship that I’ve ever experienced with a man,"" she explained, saying that she ""wasn't expecting"" to get into a relationship after her last divorce was finalized.
She continued, ""He was not on my radar. I was going to die with my six cats and my dog and be incredibly happy doing it. So this came out of left field, and I’m grateful it did. He’s very special.""
Bertinelli shared a video to her Instagram story earlier this week in which she vaguely hinted at the relationship – she reposted an old video that showed her claiming that she wouldn't date again, and in the new version, she added, ""This didn't age well.""

""What was I doing?"" she asked in her new interview. ""I just can’t help it. When I’m flipping happy, it’s all over me, and he’s one of the main reasons. I really want women and men to take away that it’s the work that you do (on yourself) that can lead you to meeting someone like I’ve been lucky enough to meet right now. This would not have happened three years ago, four years ago, last year ―  it wouldn’t have. And I feel incredibly lucky to have met him and made a connection with him.""
VALERIE BERTINELLI REFLECTS ON BEING CALLED ‘FAT AND LAZY’ THROUGH TEXTS AMID HEALING FROM DIVORCE
The ""Hot in Cleveland"" star has spoken out about the difficulties she had in her marriage to Vitale several times, even telling Hoda Kotb in a 2022 interview on the ""Today"" show that she was done with love.
""I am gonna be more than happy to be happily divorced and spend the rest of my life alone,"" she said. ""I'll be happy that way. Well, with my six cats and my dog and my son, and hopefully one day grandchildren.""
When she was asked if she'd look for love again, Bertinelli responded, ""Oh God, no.""

""Because of the challenges that I'm going through right now, because divorce sucks, I can't imagine ever trusting anyone again to let into my life. So I have some trust issues that I'm sure I'm going to have to get past.""
Later that year, when the divorce was finalized, she called herself ""happily divorced,"" and she called the day her marriage was officially over the ""second best day of [her] life,"" the first presumably being the day her only child, son Wolfgang Van Halen, was born.
On the ""Out Comes The Sun"" podcast, Bertinelli touched on the split from Vitale again, saying, ""I think because that divorce was so wicked, and it's really brought me to my knees, but I think of that as a gift because I get to learn so much about myself through this.""

"March 14, 2024 4:00am EDT",Kate Middleton's photo scandal leaves Meghan Markle 'conflicted' despite her own family victory: expert,Fox News,"Royal reporter Neil Sean joins ""The Story"" to discuss Kate Middleton’s post claiming her altered Mother’s Day photo was due to her amateur photographer editing skills.
Meghan Markle may have scored a legal victory, but several royal experts insist the Duchess of Sussex is also paying close attention to the drama unfolding across the pond.
The 42-year-old’s lengthy battle with her half-sister, Samantha Markle, came to a close on Tuesday. Samantha’s defamation lawsuit, originally brought against the duchess in 2022, was dismissed with prejudice, which means Samantha cannot file the claims again.
Samantha had alleged that she was defamed by her famous sibling during her 2021 interview with Oprah Winfrey, along with the Netflix series ""Harry & Meghan."" A spokesperson for Markle didn’t immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment.

""Sure, Meghan is delighted that she once again beat her half-sister in court,"" Christopher Andersen, author of ""The King,"" told Fox News Digital. ""But there’s no doubt that Meghan and [her husband, Prince] Harry are also keeping a very close eye on what’s happening back in the U.K.""
Markle’s recent triumph came as her sister-in-law, Princess Kate Middleton, is in the middle of a social media firestorm.
On Monday, the Princess of Wales spoke out after news and photo agencies pulled a new photo released by Kensington Palace for Mother’s Day in the U.K. due to suspicions of manipulation. The royal has kept a low profile as she recuperates from recent abdominal surgery for undisclosed reasons.

""Like many amateur photographers, I do occasionally experiment with editing,"" reads a message the mother of three shared on X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram Stories.
""I wanted to express my apologies for any confusion the family photograph we shared yesterday caused,"" the 42-year-old wrote. ""I hope everyone celebrating had a very happy Mother’s Day.""
The message was signed ""C"" for Catherine.

A spokesperson for Kensington Palace, which handles the office of the Prince and Princess of Wales, didn’t immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment.
""Meghan, in particular, must be incredibly conflicted about all the incoming heat Kate and the royals are taking, not to mention the way the palace … continues to bungle things on a daily basis,"" Andersen explained. ""On one hand, Meghan had to be sympathetic about all the stress Kate is going through as she copes with a serious medical issue. On the other hand, the palace media machine has never been more exposed for what it is: a complete mess, a total disaster.""
""When the future queen of England spends two weeks in the hospital and then takes months to recuperate – all without any real explanation – it’s hardly any wonder that conspiracy theories would proliferate,"" Andersen said. ""It isn’t difficult to imagine [the drama] that is going on behind palace walls as the power struggle between competing factions inside the monarchy heats up. Who is going to take the blame for the murky palace statements that tell us nothing or for issuing a doctored photo that Kate is then forced to try and explain away? The monarchy’s PR machinery was never that great, but this ... is bungling things in epic fashion.""
The Associated Press withdrew an image of Princess Kate Middleton and her children. Kate later apologized. (Associated Press)
The image in question showed Middleton with her children, Prince George, Prince Louis and Princess Charlotte. As of Monday afternoon, it remains on the Prince and Princess of Wales' X account.
""Thank you for your kind wishes and continued support over the last two months. Wishing everyone a Happy Mother’s Day,"" the caption read, signed with a ""C.""
Andersen doesn’t doubt that Markle can identify with Middleton’s current struggles with the press. It’s also noted that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have previously spoken out about the many hiccups the palace has had in addressing social media hate and a ruthless U.K. press.

""Meghan and Harry know what it’s like to wake up and see those screaming tabloid headlines targeting them for one thing or another,"" said Andersen. ""In [the couple’s] case, they were pilloried for, among other things, saying too much. In the royal family’s case, it’s for not saying enough about the medical crisis being faced by Kate … all this uncalled-for secrecy feeds the public’s distrust of the monarchy and, by extension, the royal family itself.""
""It’s all gotten so out of hand,"" Andersen added.
The Associated Press and other news agencies began pulling the image from their websites over concerns that it was ""manipulated.""

""AP initially published the photo, which was issued by Kensington Palace. But AP later retracted the image because at closer inspection, it appeared the source had manipulated the image in a way that did not meet AP’s photo standards. The photo shows an inconsistency in the alignment of Princess Charlotte’s left hand,"" the news agency said.
According to AP, their ""editorial standards state that images must be accurate. AP does not use altered or digitally manipulated images.
""AP’s news values and principles explain that minor photo editing, including cropping and toning and color adjustments, are acceptable when necessary for clear and accurate reproduction and should maintain the authentic nature of the photograph.""

""Changes in density, contrast, color and saturation levels that substantially alter the original scene are not acceptable. Backgrounds should not be digitally blurred or eliminated by burning down or by aggressive toning. The removal of ‘red eye’ from photographs is not permissible.""
When AP determined the photo appeared to have been manipulated, it issued what is known as a ""photo kill,"" an industry term that retracted the image and instructed clients to remove the photo from their systems.
The Associated Press also announced that ""no replacement photo will be sent."" Fox News Digital confirmed that Reuters and Getty also pulled the photo from their sites.

The guidance in January stands that the Princess would be recuperating at home in Windsor.""
Recommendations from her medical team indicated that the princess would likely not resume public duties until Easter later this month.
""The Princess of Wales appreciates the interest this statement will generate. She hopes that the public will understand her desire to maintain as much normality for her children as possible; and her wish that her personal medical information remains private,"" the original statement reads. ""The Princess of Wales wishes to apologise to all those concerned for the fact that she has to postpone her upcoming engagements. She looks forward to reinstating as many as possible, as soon as possible.""
Ian Pelham Turner told Fox News Digital that he would tell the Sussexes to ""keep a dignified silence."" (Getty Images)
Royal expert Ian Pelham Turner told Fox News Digital that the key piece of advice he would give the Sussexes right now is to ""keep a dignified silence.""
""Or, at the very most, release a statement which would say all people can make mistakes in their lives, but they wish a speedy recovery for … the Princess of Wales,"" he said. ""Meghan and Harry may use the situation to support their claims while they feel sympathy. It recognizes as well that not all is what it seems in the House of Windsor.""
Pelham Turner said the controversy is a teachable moment for the royal family: the princess should no longer take official portraits of the family and instead rely on the services of seasoned photographers, he said.

""[They have] responsibility and integrity,"" he said. ""Now everyone is waiting to see if the original image without Photoshop will be released for public scrutiny.""
Andersen said this was an ""I told you so"" moment for Markle.
""She echoed the late Princess Diana’s distrust of the power brokers inside the monarchy,"" said Andersen. ""Now it seems that even Kate, who has always seemed to handle the pressure with effortless grace, is falling victim to palace intrigue and an inept press office.
""The only way to fix things is to come clean. Until all is revealed, confidence in the monarchy as an institution will continue to erode.""

Lenny's daughter, actress Zoë Kravitz, was in attendance with her fiancé, Channing Tatum. In addition to being a guest, Zoë took to the podium to share a loving speech about her father, with hilarious jokes intertwined.

Lenny is known for his edgy look, notably the see-through shirts he is often spotted wearing. Zoë took a moment during her speech to point out the revealing shirts her father frequently fashions.
""We've been through a lot. We've seen a lot. I've seen a lot. I've seen you change in the most beautiful ways. I've seen the way you've stayed the same in the most important ways,"" Zoë said during her speech. ""I've seen the way you show up and take care of the people you love.

""And sure, it used to embarrass me when you picked me up from school as a kid, but I got to say, at this point, I respect it. You really do pull it off. Your relationship with the netted shirt is probably your longest one, and it works. You two make each other better, and if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. It’s a beautiful thing.""

Zoë then switched to a more serious tone with the loving words she shared about her famous father.
""What’s cool about you is not what people think is cool about you,"" the ""Divergent"" star said. ""Your radness doesn’t come from your shades or leather pants or netted shirts. It comes from your true love of life. Everything you do is an expression of that love.""
""You absolutely devour life. You eat up every crumb and lick the plate. Life is your art,"" Zoë continued.
Actor Denzel Washington also took center stage at the ceremony to talk about his longtime friend. Like Zoë, Washington also had moments of seriousness and silliness during his speech.

""Every time I shake hands like this with Lenny, I always have my eyes open, because once he had a ring on, a thumb ring, and we went to shake hands, and he busted my thumb open,"" Washington said in the opening of his speech. ""He’s more than a friend, more than a brother. We’re twins, we just don’t look alike. We’ve had a close brothership friendship for … 30 years,"" the actor continued.

Washington also pulled from Webster's dictionary as he talked about the definition of ""friendship.""
""A person who one knows, and with whom one has a bond of mutual affection, typically exclusive of sexual relations,"" the actor read. At this point, Washington paused and looked over at Kravitz, and said a joking voice, ""Well …,"" which led both men to break out in laughter.

"March 13, 2024 5:25pm EDT",Kate Middleton photographer denies editing claims after car photo goes viral,Fox News,"Princess Kate Middleton issued an apology after a Mother’s Day family photo sparked viral confusion.
New theories surrounding photographs of Kate Middleton leaving Windsor Castle with Prince William earlier this week have been debunked by the photographer who captured the images.
Middleton, who has been missing from the public eye for more than two months and is now at the forefront of a royal photo scandal, was pictured riding in the backseat of a vehicle alongside the Prince of Wales on Monday — only the second sighting of the Princess of Wales since Christmas Day.
Amateur Internet sleuths attempted to dissect the image after Middleton's Mother's Day photo was pulled from major photo agencies due to ""manipulation"" concerns.

Online speculation grew quickly after the image was released, with social media users implying the photo had been edited. Bennett, who works with Goff Photos, explained the difficulty in capturing shots of moving vehicles.
""Car shots are unpredictable at the best of times and with some reflection on the glass it can be difficult,"" he said.

Middleton has remained out of the public eye since Dec. 25. She was admitted into the hospital for a planned abdominal surgery on Jan. 17, and prior to Monday, had only been spotted once since her hospitalization. Her new sighting came the day after the royal family photo drama.

Metadata from Middleton's Mother's Day photo revealed the image had been digitally altered multiple times before it was published on the official royal social media platforms, Fox News Digital confirmed.

After the photo was released, eagle-eyed followers soon noticed the image appeared to be distorted. The Associated Press and other news agencies began pulling the image from their websites over concerns that it was ""manipulated.""
The Princess of Wales apologized one day later and admitted that the image shared online had been edited.
Middleton took to social media to issue a statement, writing, ""Like many amateur photographers, I do occasionally experiment with editing. I wanted to express my apologies for any confusion the family photograph we shared yesterday caused. I hope everyone celebrating had a very happy Mother’s Day.""
Earlier this month, a spokesperson for Kensington Palace told Fox News Digital: ""Kensington Palace made it clear in January the timelines of the Princess’ recovery and we’d only be providing significant updates. The guidance in January stands that the Princess would be recuperating at home in Windsor.""
The spokesperson reiterated the princess is ""doing well.""
The statement came amid a flurry of conspiracy theories that emerged on sites like X, formerly known as Twitter, and TikTok, with users speculating about the royal's whereabouts and health condition. The hashtag #WhereisKate previously went viral on the social media platforms.

"March 11, 2024 4:30am EDT",'Land of the Lost' child star lived 'Yellowstone' life after Hollywood fame,Fox News,"Fox News Flash top entertainment and celebrity headlines are here.
Kathy Coleman was 18 years old and filming Burger King commercials when she said ""I do"" and left Hollywood.
The former child star, who had skyrocketed to fame with ""Land of the Lost,"" got her hands dirty as she worked on her father-in-law’s Fallon, Nevada ranch. The 62-year-old is now back in California and ready for her close-up, but still has fond memories of life out of the spotlight.
""It was very hard work, but it was also very rewarding,"" the actress told Fox News Digital. ""It’s funny, I watched ‘Yellowstone,’ recently – the whole series. I lived that life! I lived that exact life.""
'LAND OF THE LOST' STAR KATHY COLEMAN RECALLS GETTING INTO TROUBLE ON SET, REVEALS WHY HIT SHOW CAME TO AN END

""Land of the Lost,"" a Saturday morning favorite, is now available for streaming on The Sid and Marty Krofft Channel. The producing pair were known for their imaginative children’s programming.
The show followed the adventures of the Marshall family, trapped in a land of dinosaurs, lizard men called Sleestak and enigmatic pylons offering the hope of a way back home. ""Land of the Lost,"" which also starred Wesley Eure, Spencer Milligan and Phillip Paley, among others, aired from 1974 to 1976.
""When ‘Land of the Lost’ was first introduced, my sisters and I fell in love with the character Holly [played by Coleman],"" Marty’s daughter, Deanna Krofft Pope, told Fox News Digital. ""We wanted to be like her, and we weren’t alone. I believe most little girls looked at her as a role model. She was strong, independent and fearless.""

""Holly didn't just stay in the cave and make stone soup,"" Krofft Pope shared. ""From dinosaurs to aliens, Holly boldly faced the dangers of ‘Land of the Lost,’ proving she was a survivor. Kathy did a remarkable job bringing the character of Holly to life, making her a fan favorite.""
Like all child stars, Coleman grew up. And life on the farm turned out to be a blessing, she said, one that taught her the importance of no-nonsense hard work.
And there was no special treatment, she insisted.

""The farm was gigantic,"" Coleman recalled. ""We had a hog farm where we produced 12,000 hogs a year. We were milking 24-hour double shifts. Because my father-in-law owned the ranch, we were brought in, and we started at the bottom of the totem pole. We had to learn everything. You messed up, God help you.""

""[My father-in-law] said, ‘You can never ask anybody to do something you don’t know how to do or haven’t done yourself,’"" she said. ""So I did everything. I fed the cows, I milked them. I worked the hay, the grains. I worked the front loaders, all kinds of stuff. I really had to learn everything. There are 150 steps to cleaning the milk barn after every milking session. And all 150 steps had to be done just right.""
The clean-up was far from glamorous, she chuckled. But there were perks.

""We had baby calves all over the place,"" she gushed. ""We also used to have nice parties. It was a small town, so we knew everybody. We put everybody to work in the town. I was only 18. I was raised in Los Angeles and put on a farm in Nevada at 18. It was a culture shock… But my mother taught me something that I think has been a valuable lesson in [surviving child stardom] – ‘Stay true to your word.’ If you’re going to do something, follow through. Fame is not an easy club to belong to. It’s taxing. But if you stay true to your word and what you’re going to do, what you’re going to achieve, you can survive anything.""

""People think that because you’re on television, life is so easy,"" she reflected. ""I just had a different kind of job that happened to be on television. I went through all the same heartaches and hardships that any other teenager or woman goes through – and 10 others… My life changed, but I was also a responsible soul. I learned to love myself. You can’t survive this industry without learning to love yourself.""
Some of Coleman’s happiest memories involve being on the set of ""Land of the Lost."" As a gift for nabbing the role of Holly, Coleman’s mother gifted her a pony – a sign of what her future would look like. Her castmates also became lifelong friends.

""It’s not very common in this industry to have such a closeness as we do,"" she shared. ""I live right down from my [TV] brother. We travel together all the time. We really are like brother and sister. My TV father was like a real father. I grew up in a single-family home, so I wasn’t raised with a father in the house. And yet, he stepped into that role, not only for the show but in real life as well. We’re extremely close and love each other to death.""
But all good things come to an end, Coleman admitted.
""Why did the show end? I believe it was a combination of things,"" she explained. ""There was a limited amount of funds to produce this show, one that had a lot of special effects. I was also hired as a young girl. I was already starting to bypass [co-star] Wesley Eure in height… The show ended, but the memories remain.""

Coleman has written two books chronicling her life in Hollywood, with ""Run, Holly Run!"" being the most recent. Her marriage lasted from 1980 to 1987 and the mother of two now resides in Palm Springs.
Life ""isn’t all that quiet,"" she noted. Coleman frequently travels the country throughout the year and meets with fans at conventions. ""Land of the Lost"" loosely inspired the 2009 film by the same name starring Will Ferrell, but Coleman said it ""totally missed the mark."" She believes the series is ripe for a reboot.
""Life is wonderful,"" she said. ""I have great friends. I’m surrounded by a lot of loving people and good energy. I have great kids whom I adore. Life is good – it truly is. I made it that way. I did the homework. I did the legwork.""

In an interview with People magazine, Carey, 65, broke down his old post-game show ritual, which included medicating with food. ""I would go out to Swingers diner after ‘The Price is Right’ my first year, get a plate of pasta, a cupcake and iced tea with a bunch of lemons,"" he told the outlet. ""Then I’d go home, have Doritos and several Pepsis, and take an Ambien to go to sleep.

"March 13, 2024 10:31am EDT",‘Star Wars’ child actor in mental health facility after ‘full-blown psychotic break',Fox News,"""Star Wars"" actress Daisy Ridley downplayed the suggestion that fans were sexist after the latest film's female director was attacked by some fans.
It's been nearly 25 years since ""Star Wars"" child actor Jake Lloyd appeared on the big screen in ""The Phantom Menace"" and since then he's mostly stayed out of the public eye.
In an interview with Scripps News, Jake's mother, Lisa Lloyd, explained that her now 35-year-old son has had a long battle with mental health and is currently at a mental health rehabilitation facility.
Lisa told the outlet that she began noticing her son struggling with mental health while he was still in school.

""Jake started having some trouble in high school,"" she said. ""He started talking about ‘realities.’ He didn't know if he was in this reality, or a different reality. I didn't really know exactly what to say to that.""
‘STAR WARS’ AND ‘GREMLINS’ VOICE ACTOR MARK DODSON DEAD AT 64
Lisa recalled asking Jake if he was going to finish his homework one afternoon after a day of school.
""And he was like, ‘Well, I don't even know if I need to do it. I don’t know which reality I’m in,’"" Lisa shared. ""And I'm like, ‘Well, you're in my reality today, so you have to do your homework.’""
Lloyd's mother explained that she took him to a doctor who suggested he had bipolar disorder. Lisa said he was prescribed several medications, but nothing worked.

Jake went on to graduate from high school in 2007 and enrolled in the private arts school, Columbia College Chicago.
Lisa told the outlet that her son's short enrollment at the college did not go well for him.

""He missed a lot of classes, and he was telling me that people were following him,"" she said. Her motherly instincts kicked in, and she knew something was not right with her son.
She recalled Jake telling her that people with ""black eyes"" were staring at him on the street, and he would have conversations with ""The Daily Show"" host Jon Stewart late at night, through the television.
""He didn't tell us he was hearing voices at the time. But he was,"" Lisa told the outlet.

Before completing his first year, Jake left Columbia College Chicago and moved in with his mother in Indiana. Once he was back with Lisa, he was given a new mental health diagnosis, paranoid schizophrenia.
""When they finally told him, it totally threw him off into an even worse depression,"" Lisa explained. ""It was really hard.""
Lisa said Jake also has a neurological condition known as anosognosia, which according to the National Institute of Health, ""is a neurological condition in which the patient is unaware of their neurological deficit or psychiatric condition.""
Lisa said Jake's condition stopped him from wanting to take medication because he didn't believe he was sick.

She explained, ""He didn't think he needed to go to the therapist because there's nothing wrong with him.""
Fast-forward to 2015, Lisa received a phone call from Colleton County Sheriff’s Department in South Carolina. Jake was driving from Florida to Canada alone when he was arrested after leading deputies on a multi-country car chase before crashing his vehicle.
Lisa explained that she hired a lawyer to get her son out of jail, but he refused to talk to her.
""I tried to call him and he wouldn't talk to me. Just flat-out refused,"" Lisa shared. ""I was talking to the people at the jail and trying to explain to them that he's off his medication. But they wouldn't give him his medication.""

Lisa demanded her son be transferred to a hospital, but he ended up serving 10 months in jail.
This process was very hard on Lisa.
""As a mom, you're just pulling your hair out because your child needs help,"" she explained. ""You know that he's sick. You know that he's not going to get any better unless he gets some medication.""
After Lisa continuously sent letters to Jake in jail, he finally reached out to her. She was able to get her son to a hospital before moving with him to California.
In 2018, things took a horrible turn for the Lloyd family.

Jake's younger sister, Madison – who appeared as an extra in ""The Phantom Menace"" – died unexpectedly in her sleep from natural causes. She was 26.
""He just couldn't handle it,"" Lisa said. ""He didn't know how to process it. Sometimes he would just start saying that he really missed Madison. That's about as much of a conversation as we'd have about it. ""
She added, ""At least he was acknowledging it.""
Last year, Jake was still struggling with his mental health. In March, Lisa recalled the moment her son had what she called a ""full-blown psychotic break"" while driving with her after getting food at McDonald's.

""He said he wanted to turn the car off. And he turned the car off in the middle of the three lanes, and we were in the middle lane,"" she explained. ""There was a lot of yelling and screaming.""
Drivers witnessing the incident called 911.
""The police got there, and they asked Jake some questions,"" she said. ""He was talking to them, but none of it made sense. It was all word salad.""
Jake was not taken to jail, but was admitted to a mental health rehabilitation facility the following day.

Jake is currently 10 months into his 18-month stay. Lisa has seen improvements in her son and hopes this experience is a pivotal turning point in his mental health journey.
""He’s doing much better than I expected,"" she said. ""He is relating to people better and becoming a little bit more social, which is really nice. It's kind of like having more of the old Jake back, because he has always been incredibly social until he became schizophrenic.""

Lisa said Jake is now understanding the importance of taking his medication and has enthusiasm for life again, including seeing his friends and attending family barbecues.
She even took Jake to see ""Wonka"" for his 35th birthday last week and the mother-son duo ""filled up on popcorn.""
Lisa explained that Jake is still a big fan of the ""Star Wars"" franchise. (Getty Images)
""He really loved it,"" she said. ""That was one of the things that we couldn’t do when he was off his medication was watch movies. He just didn’t have the attention span for it.""
As for ""Star Wars,"" Jake still keeps up with the new shows. Lisa said he is a fan of the new Disney+ series, ""Ahsoka.""
She explained, ""He loves all the new 'Star Wars' stuff. People think Jake hates 'Star Wars.' He loves it.""
Lisa also wanted to make it clear that Jake starring in ""The Phantom Menance"" as a child did not prompt him to walk away from acting or contribute to his mental health issues. Prior to appearing in ""Star Wars,"" Jake made his acting debut alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger in the 1996 film, ""Jingle All the Way.""

""It would have happened anyway,"" Lisa said, noting that there is a history of schizophrenia on Jake's father's side of the family.
She added, ""I believe that it was genetic. And his psychiatrist also agrees that Jake was going to become schizophrenic.""

Lisa also noted that when the ""Star Wars"" film received backlash after it's release in 1999, she shielded any negativity from her son.
""I protected him from the backlash. He was just riding his bike outside, playing with his friends. He didn't know. He didn't care,"" she said. ""Everybody makes such a big deal about that. And it's rather annoying to me because Jake was a little kid when that came out, and he didn't really feel all that stuff because I didn't let him online.""
Lisa explained that in high school, Jake was bullied by kids for starring in the sci-fi film. She maintains that the franchise did not contribute to Jake's decision to leave acting.

""People say he quit because of 'Star Wars.' Well, that's not true. It didn't have anything to do with 'Star Wars.' It had more to do with our family. And we were going through a divorce,"" she explained. ""Things were unsettled and kind of rough. And Jake didn't seem to be having a lot of fun auditioning anymore.""

""Jake loved filming 'Star Wars.' He had so much fun,"" Lisa said. ""I would love for him to get well enough to be able to do a little bit of something, and I’m sure he would maybe like to do that. He couldn't at this point, but you never know how much he's going to improve. So we'll see.""

"March 12, 2023 8:09am EDT","Academy Awards drama, controversies, snubs and more from Oscars past",Fox News,"Fox Nation host Jimmy Failla praised Chris Rock for the 'brilliant' move on 'Fox & Friends' and how Smith's 'miscalculation' set the stage for the special.
The Academy Awards ceremony marks one of the biggest days for Hollywood elites. The history of the highly esteemed awards show has been filled with triumphs and controversies.
The Oscars have been bringing Hollywood together and also pulling them apart since the first ceremony in 1929. From award refusals to controversial decisions, stage kisses to slaps, the ceremony has seen quite a bit of drama.
Here is a look into some of the most dramatic moments from the Academy Awards through the years.
HOSTING AN OSCARS VIEWING PARTY? 5 TIPS FOR THROWING AN AWARD-WORTHY AFFAIR
The Oscars have brought many memorable moments since its start in 1929. (Stefani Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images)
In 1936, Dudley Nichols declined his Oscar, making it the first but not the last time this would happen. Nichols was a screenwriter who won the award for his movie ""The Informer.""
Nichols declined the award with the reasoning that the Academy did not acknowledge the Screen Writers Guild, which Nichols was one of the founders of.
A couple of years later, in 1938, Nichols finally accepted the award after the Screen Writers Guild was certified by the National Labor Relations Board.
The 1941 film ""How Green Was My Valley"" won best picture, but it was up against ""Citizen Kane,"" a movie regarded as one of the best of all time. It is known as one of the biggest Oscar snubs in history.
Regardless of ""Citizen Kane's"" status, ""How Green Was My Valley"" walked away with the biggest award of the night.
""How Green Was My Valley"" starred Irish-American actress Maureen O'Hara and British actor Roddy McDowall.
In 1969, there was an exact tie in the votes for best actress. The tie was between Barbra Streisand and Katharine Hepburn, who each earned 3,030 votes.
Hepburn was up for the award for her role in ""The Lion in Winter,"" while Streisand was up for her part as Fanny Brice in ""Funny Girl.""
""The Lion in Winter"" was set during Christmastime and starred Academy Award nominee Anthony Hopkins. ""Funny Girl"" is a classic musical drama set in New York City.

George C. Scott was nominated for best actor for playing Gen. George S. Patton in ""Patton."" While he made it clear he would reject a nomination if awarded one, he was still nominated and won.
OSCARS QUIZ! HOW WELL DO YOU KNOW THE FACTS ABOUT THE ACADEMY AWARDS?
Scott did not attend the ceremony to accept his award and said that the reasoning behind his refusal was because he did not agree with the creative performances being compared between actors.
Marlon Brando also declined an Oscar after he won best actor for his role as Vito Corleone in ""The Godfather.""
Although he was not present at the ceremony, he did send American actress Sacheen Littlefeather in his place to decline the award. According to History.com, Brando declined the award as he was protesting the portrayal of Native Americans in films.
Littlefeather explained in her speech that the actor refused to accept his award because of the lack of Native American representation in the film/television industry.

In 1974, a naked man named Robert Opel ran across the stage behind British actor David Niven. Niven went with the moment and calmly made a joke, causing many to believe that the moment was planned.
Niven then went on to introduce Elizabeth Taylor to the stage to present the award for best picture.
In 1985, Sally Field delivered the most quoted (and misquoted) Oscars acceptance speech ever. ""You like me! Right now, you like me!"" she yelled on stage. Yeah, we’re guessing she wishes she could take that one back.
Rob Lowe, now more than three decades sober, opened the 1989 Oscars with an awkward rendition of ""Proud Mary"" alongside Snow White, who was played by Eileen Bowman.
The cringe worthy ensemble is said to have destroyed the career of its producer, Allan Carr.
Jack Palance won best supporting actor and used his time in the spotlight to show he could do a one-armed push-up; in fact, he did several. The actor then continued with a strange, rambling speech.
Marisa Tomei was a supporting actress for her role as Mona Lisa Vita in the 1992 film ""My Cousin Vinny."" A lot of people were confused about her win since she took the trophy from well-known and seasoned actresses Joan Plowright, Vanessa Redgrave, Judy Davis and Miranda Richardson.
Marisa Tomei's Oscar win in 1993 was a bit of a controversial one because of how new she was to the industry at the time of her win. (Steve Starr/Corbis/Corbis via Getty Images)
WHO HAS THE MOST OSCARS IN THE HISTORY OF THE ACADEMY AWARDS?
Rumors quickly circulated that presenter Jack Palance was drunk and read out the wrong name, but that rumor was debunked by a spokesperson for the Academy.
In 1997, we all memorized at least a few of Leonardo DiCaprio’s iconic lines from ""Titanic,"" and so did James Cameron, apparently.
When accepting the award for best director at the Oscars, Cameron exclaimed ""I am the king of the world!"" It became known as one of the most arrogant Oscar moments of all time.
Angelina Jolie won the Oscar in 2000 for best supporting actress for ""Girl, Interrupted."" When Jolie accepted her award, she said, ""I'm so in love with my brother right now,"" during her speech.
Earlier that night on the red carpet, Jolie and her brother shared a strange kiss on the lips that was captured by photographers.

In 2003, Adrien Brody won the award for best actor for his performance in ""The Pianist."" When he went up to accept the award, he stole a kiss on the lips from Halle Berry.
Later in 2017, on an episode of ""Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen,"" Berry responded to a question about whether the kiss was staged.
""No, that was not planned,"" she said. ""I knew nothing about it.""

When Michael Moore won an Oscar for ""Bowling for Columbine"" in 2003, he turned his acceptance speech into a political pitch.
HOW DO THE ACADEMY AWARDS WORK? FIND OUT WHO VOTES FOR THE ACADEMY NOMINEES
Moore took the opportunity on stage to criticize the Bush administration and was met with conflicting cheers and boos from audience members, who – like viewers at home – just wanted to hear him talk about his movie.
James Franco and Anne Hathaway are great actors, but the two did not make such great Oscar hosts in 2011. They were called ""boring,"" ""spectacularly bad"" and the like by critics across the board.
The worst moment of the night came when Franco dressed up as Marilyn Monroe, pretty much guaranteeing that he would never again host the awards show.

In 2012, Sacha Baron Cohen turned up at the Academy Awards dressed as his movie character ""The Dictator"" and dumped gray ""ashes"" on red carpet host Ryan Seacrest.
THE ACADEMY AWARDS: DO CELEBRITIES GET PAID FOR WINNING AN OSCAR AWARD OR RECEIVING A NOMINATION?
The ""American Idol"" host handled the ambush like a pro and quickly returned to his red carpet interviews.
In 2014, Idina Menzel took the Oscar's stage to sing the hit song ""Let It Go"" from ""Frozen.""
John Travolta introduced Menzel, but fumbled with her name, calling her ""Adele Dazeem.""
The two have joked about the moment since. In 2024, Menzel marked the 10-year anniversary of the flub on social media.
During the 2017 Oscars, the wrong name was announced for the award for best picture during an unforgettable snafu.
Warren Beatty and Fay Dunaway were the presenters of the award. They announced ""La La Land"" as the winner, but the true winner was ""Moonlight.""
The problem was not fixed right away, with the ""La La Land"" cast and crew getting up on stage and beginning their speeches before the awkward mix-up was caught.

Jordan Horowitz, producer of ""La La Land,"" corrected the mistake by saying ""There's a mistake. ‘Moonlight,’ you guys won best picture.""
Jimmy Kimmel addressed Horowitz with, ""I would like to see you get an Oscar anyway, why can't we just give out a whole bunch of them?,"" to which Horowitz graciously responded, ""I'm going to be really proud to hand this to my friends from ‘Moonlight.’""
Beatty then explained what happened, revealing that he and Dunaway had the wrong envelope. They were given the winner of best actress, instead of best picture.
In arguably the most controversial Oscar moment over the years, Will Smith slapped Chris Rock, who was hosting the show.
Leading up to the slap, Rock made a joke about Smith's wife, Jada Pinkett Smith. After the joke, Smith quickly moved toward the stage and slapped Rock across the face.

After the incident, Smith was banned from the Oscars and all other Academy events for 10 years. He also resigned as a member of the Academy.
Of course, the slap didn't stay in 2022. During the 2023 Oscar Awards, the slap was referred to multiple times.
WILL SMITH BANNED FROM OSCARS: A LOOK AT WHO ELSE GOT THE BOOT FROM THE ACADEMY
""We want you to have fun, we want you to feel safe, and most importantly, we want me to feel safe,"" Oscar host Kimmel said in 2023. ""So we have strict policies in place. If anyone in this theater commits an act of violence at any point during the show, you will be awarded the Oscar for best actor and permitted to give a 19-minute-long speech.""
Every award season comes with surprise nominations and snubs, but Andrea Riseborough's, in particular, was a frequent topic of discussion.
Riseborough was nominated for best actress in 2023 for her performance in the independent film ""To Leslie.""
Riseborough's nomination came as quite a shock, especially considering she was not nominated for a similar award at previous shows in the awards season, like the Golden Globes.
This movie didn't get too much attention until other celebrities, like Gwyneth Paltrow, Jennifer Aniston and Charlize Theron, started hosting screenings and praising the film on social media. Cate Blanchett even shouted out Riseborough in her acceptance speech for best actress at the Critics Choice Awards, even though Riseborough was not nominated.

After Riseborough was nominated for best actress at the Oscars, the Academy put out a statement saying they were ""conducting a review of the campaign procedures around this year's nominees."" The Academy did not cite Riseborough or ""To Leslie"" by name, but it was speculated that was what the review was about.

It was decided by the Academy that they would not revoke Riseborough's nomination.
""Based on concerns that surfaced last week around the ‘To Leslie’ awards campaign, the Academy began a review into the film's campaigning tactics. The Academy has determined the activity in question does not rise to the level that the film's nomination should be rescinded,"" Academy CEO Bill Kramer said in a statement. ""However, we did discover social media and outreach campaigning tactics that caused concern. These tactics are being addressed with the responsible parties directly.""
When all was said and done, Riseborough kept her nomination, but did not take home the prize. In 2023, Michelle Yeoh won the best actress category for ""Everything Everywhere All at Once.""

Lucy Walsh was just 12 years old when she really got to know her biological father, Eagles guitarist Joe Walsh.
At the time, the rocker had gotten sober and went back to work with the band after living in the fast lane for years.
""Before that, I didn’t know him very well,"" the actress and fellow musician told Fox News Digital. ""I would see him maybe once a year, and it was like Christmas. Getting to see my dad this one time of year was just so exciting. But then he would go away again, and I wouldn’t know when the next time I was going to see him was.""

""So, when he got sober, and I was 12, my life changed,"" she shared. ""My dad wasn’t working that much in the music business. He’d been very famous before that. But during my young life, he wasn’t very active. And then when he rejoined the Eagles, I realized my dad is … a very big deal. And it was shocking to me. I write about it in the book as being one of the first concerts they played [at the time].""
The 41-year-old has written a new memoir, ""Remember Me as Human: What Three Final Days with My Grandmother Wanda Taught Me About Truly Living."" It explores her relationship with her maternal grandmother, Wanda, before she died in 2011. The matriarch passed away four months after Walsh interviewed her in her nursing home.
In the book, Walsh reflects on her life, including her relationship with her father, 76.

""I had always heard stories about my dad from the press,"" she admitted. ""Kids would bring magazines to school with pretty disturbing information. And I had never spoken to him about these things. But as I got to know him as a person … it’s the same thing that I realized with my grandmother. I got to know his humanity. I got to see him as a full person, not just my dad or some guy in these magazine stories. … It’s seeing your parents as a person, as a human. Forgiving them for their trespasses is what I think becoming an adult is about. It’s about granting them empathy and mercy for things you think might’ve been mistakes in the past.""
Lucy Walsh interviewed her grandmother for three days before the matriarch passed away in 2011. (Justin Piccari)
""With Dad, it’s been a lot because he’s in the public eye,"" Walsh continued. ""His mistakes get printed in the news. And so, there’s been a lot of hearsay that I have been able to talk through now with him as an adult and come to terms with who he really is. And love him for who he is.""
Joe joined the Eagles after becoming friends with Don Henley and Glenn Frey, People magazine reported. As the band skyrocketed to fame, so did his dependence on drugs and alcohol. When the group broke up in 1980, Walsh’s addiction worsened. According to the outlet, he turned to alcohol to cope with severe stage fright.

The outlet noted that in 1994, Henley and Frey had plans to get the Eagles back together, and they would only do it with a sober Walsh. The pair, as well as manager Irving Azoff, approached Walsh with their proposition, and they eventually reunited for the album ""Hell Freezes Over.""
In the book, Walsh described seeing her father on stage for the first time.
""It was a live televised taping for VH1,"" she recalled. ""I was sitting in the audience between Whoopi Goldberg and Claudia Schiffer … the roar of that audience just brought me to tears. I was just so overwhelmed by it all. And then we spent a lot of great time together.""

""I’ve got to thank my mother,"" Walsh shared. ""She never spoke badly about my father to me, which a lot of women do with their children. And I’m very grateful that she gave me that gift because I didn’t have any negativity about my dad in my head. She always told him, ‘When you get sober, I’ll be right there to make sure that you and Lucy have a relationship.’ And she really did. She made it possible for my dad and I to become very close after that.""
Walsh said that her grandmother’s upbringing in Illinois changed her viewpoint on fame. Sitting down with Wanda during her final months, in particular, taught her that fame is just ""smoke and mirrors."" Famous people are just people with their own problems.
""I remember when I was 12, [my dad] bought the red Mustang from one of the James Bond movies, and we would drive it around,"" said Walsh. ""I would think, ‘We can speed because he’s invincible. Nothing can hurt us because he’s famous.’ … But my mom’s side of the family lived such a normal life that it changed my perspective on fame.""

Lucy Walsh said she grew up with two loving, supportive fathers. (Justin Piccari)
Growing up with two fathers, Walsh said she was exposed to ""two different worlds."" Her stepfather ""was not famous"" but was a stable, loving force in her life.
""When I was younger, I was very torn,"" she said. ""I felt guilty for wanting a relationship with my biological father, even though he wasn’t really around. … It tore me in half for a long time. The great thing about it is that both dads are very supportive of each other. That gave me the freedom to love them both without having to hang onto that guilt any longer.""
But it wasn’t just the men that gave Walsh valuable lessons in living. Wanda taught her the importance of forgiving one’s parents.
Lucy Walsh said she learned many life lessons from her maternal grandmother Wanda. (Justin Piccari)
""I learned a lot about my grandparents as people who were young and trying to figure out life and making mistakes and messing up,"" she noted. ""And you don’t think of your grandparents that way. … But they were young and vibrant once, just like us.""
""The most important thing my grandmother taught me about life became the title of my book,"" she said. ""She stood for embracing our humanity and our imperfections. And that’s the message I hope to pass along with this book. Let’s celebrate our humanity, the messy, contradictory, pathetic, glorious humanity that we all share, instead of trying to be so perfect and polished. Remember me as human is what my grandmother taught me, and that’s what we should all wish to be remembered as.""

Although Carey and Harwick never made it down the aisle after their engagement in 2018, pictures of the former marriage and family therapist still remain in Carey's home and close to his heart.

"March 13, 2024 4:00am EDT","Princess Diana's brother, Charles Spencer, reveals devastating family secret",Fox News,"Curator David Corelli spoke to Fox News Digital about ""Princess Diana: A Tribute Exhibition"" in Las Vegas, which coincides with the 25th anniversary of the late British royal's death.
Charles Spencer was 42 years old when he first revealed he was sexually abused as a child.
The younger brother of Princess Diana, now 59, initially made the revelation to a therapist after he ""hit rock bottom."" Seventeen years later, the 9th Earl Spencer is detailing the alleged trauma he endured in a new memoir, ""A Very Private School.""
""I was doing a 10-day course of very deep introspection and therapy,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""My therapist said to each of us, ‘Whisper to me one secret you’d never told anyone.’ I whispered to him that I was sexually abused as a child by an adult. And I remember him looking so shocked, and he had heard it all. Afterward, he took me aside and said, ‘This is very serious stuff.’""

""By that stage, I had children,"" the father of seven shared. ""I suddenly put it into context. Wat if one of my children of either gender had been subjected to this as an 11-year-old? It made my blood boil. I then started to allow myself to feel the full devastation of what had happened to me.""
At age 8, Spencer was enrolled at Maidwell Hall, an elite English boarding school. The historian said meeting with other former pupils compelled him to revisit painful memories of the past.

""As I listened to their stories, I was appalled,"" he recalled. ""There was one [former student] I met with after not seeing him for 40 years. I knew from his wife that he had never talked about his time at the school because it was so traumatizing. He told me how he was made to feel worthless every day, how he’d been seriously sexually assaulted as a 9-year-old three times by somebody who was meant to protect him.
""I took 10 pages of notes, stopped and said, ‘This is too terrible — I can’t tell this story.’ He reached across, grabbed my arm and said, ‘Somebody has to do it – it’s got to be you.’ That convinced me, the truth needed to be shared with the world.""

Spencer said he found family records dating back 300 years of fellow Spencers attending boarding school.
""It was considered essential to send your children away to places where they would meet the right people,"" Spencer explained. ""These privileged kids would meet and form lifelong bonds at a price. You were ripped away from your family, and you’d probably be subjected to pretty brutal behavior.
""But this was a trade-off that was in place and still is, I guess, among the upper classes of England. You don’t have to bother with child-rearing, and you can get on with your pampered lives. At the same time, the kid will come out with huge social advantages and a network of friends that will support those social advantages for a lifetime.""
Spencer claimed it didn’t take long to witness – and experience – incidents of alleged abuse behind closed doors.

""It was a brutal experience,"" he claimed. ""The headmaster was a sadistic pedophile. He staffed a very small number of teachers in this place who were either … perverted or would never tell tales against him. There wasn’t really anyone to go to.
"" I think my parents had no idea of the level of cruelty and perversion that was going on. They would never have sent me there. I think they probably had an old-fashioned view that corporal punishment, the beatings, would probably be part of the school. But they were such a ritual part of every day. There were 72 boys and at least a half dozen of us would be beaten every day. Your time came around very quickly. I don’t think the parents had any knowledge of that.""
In his memoir, Charles Spencer alleged he was physically and sexually abused at Maidwell Hall. (Courtesy of Charles Spencer)
Spencer claimed that one student was whipped so badly he struggled to take off his underpants at night because the dried blood and clothing stuck to his skin. The boy had to sit in a warm bath until the fabric came loose. The wounds took two weeks to heal.
Spencer alleged in his book that, after tea time, dozens of boys would disappear into a private wing, where they endured nightly beatings. There wasn’t hope that pajama pants would provide any protection. Spencer said the pain he experienced from his beatings was ""shocking in its intensity.""

""There were certain things you would get beaten for,"" Spencer reflected. ""If you spoke after the lights had been turned off. If you spilled water or milk accidentally. I remember one boy was at the school gymnasium. He was standing against these bars on a wall when he put his arms back and said, ‘Look, I’m Jesus Christ!’
""He was whipped very badly for blasphemy. He was just a little boy having a moment of humor. … These were perverted adults taking advantage of these boys … and we had no communication with the outside world.""

Spencer claimed he was allowed to write a letter to his parents once a week. The messages were supervised, and he was unable to tell them what was happening. Spencer later learned that the parents of one student, who recently died from a long terminal disease, still had his letters. They were stained with tears.
""We were just left there at the mercy of some really dangerous people,"" Spencer alleged.

Spencer was also plagued by loneliness. He often thought of his older sister, Diana. The Princess of Wales who died injuries she sustained in a car crash in 1997. She was 36.
""She was the closest person to me growing up,"" he said. ""We had two much older sisters and a baby brother who had died. Then there was Diana and me. We were very close. And, actually, that was one of the devastations of being sent away. She was sent a year ahead of me, but for the first few years of my life, we went everywhere together.
""We did everything together. We went to a very gentle primary school together, a day school, [before boarding school]. She was an absolutely lovely older sister to a little boy whose parents were divorced and had quite a traditional English upbringing. We were allies.""
""We were allies,"" Charles Spencer told Fox News Digital about his relationship with Princess Diana. (Courtesy of Charles Spencer)
In the book, Spencer claimed he was groomed and sexually abused at age 11 by an assistant matron at the school. She was about 19 or 20, Spencer said. He alleged that the unnamed matron preyed on other boys who were under 13 years old. According to Spencer, the alleged abuse led him to lose his virginity by secretly paying a sex worker while on a trip to Italy with his mother. He was 12 years old.

Over the years, Spencer kept the abuse a secret. But after two failed marriages, Spencer realized he needed help.
""I was so confused by my endless romantic disasters, deep unhappiness and two divorces,"" he explained. ""I also wanted to do something for my children. Actually, that was the spur. I wanted to get better for them, so I could be a better father. I don’t know if they would agree that I managed it, but that was my aim. And I think, if I hadn’t been a parent, I probably would have just gone on ... coping. [Saying it out loud] was surprisingly helpful. It didn’t get to the root of the problem, but it sent me on a course of more honest therapy.""
A spokesperson for Maidwell Hall didn't immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. It previously told ""Today"" it has notified authorities who investigate possible crimes against children. School officials are also encouraging any past students with similar experiences to come forward.

Today, Spencer said, he’s ""really turned a corner"" in the last three to four months, especially after writing his book. He’s still doing ""a very effective"" post-traumatic stress disorder treatment, as well as Tai Chi and breathing exercises.

Today, Spencer lives about 10 miles from Maidwell Hall. He hopes the school will now deal with its past ""in an honest way.""
""I would tell [my younger self] it wasn’t his fault,"" Spencer said. ""As a child, you’re always thinking it’s your fault. I used to think I must have failed as a son to be sent away to such a place and not be part of the family. … But I would tell him, ‘You’re fine. You’ve come out on the other side.’""

Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are still fighting over their French winery, with Pitt winning the latest round.
Jolie previously attempted to overturn a tentative ruling which allowed Pitt’s claims that she sold her stake in Château Miraval without his agreement to proceed to trial. She argued her ex-husband's claim was ""frivolous, malicious, and part of a problematic pattern.""
However, court minutes from March 8 seen by Fox News Digital, show that the court rejected those arguments and upheld it's earlier ruling.
ANGELINA JOLIE'S FORMER COMPANY CLAIMS BRAD PITT ‘MASTERMINDED’ PLAN TO ‘LOOT’ AND STRIP WINE BUSINESS: DOCS
A judge will allow Brad Pitt's lawsuit involving the French winery he bought with ex-wife Angelina Jolie to move to trial. (Getty Images)
Pitt's legal team has now been given the go ahead to sue Jolie for breach of implied-in-fact contract and breach of quasi-contract. The ""Babylon"" actor will also be allowed to amend his claim of breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
The dispute returns to court this week to tackle technical aspects as the two continue to fight over ownership of Château Miraval.
Pitt and Jolie were married two years before the actress filed for divorce in 2016, effectively ending their 12-year relationship. They became legally single in 2019.
The former couple bought a controlling stake in Château Miraval in 2008 and spent time at the home throughout their relationship.

Jolie attempted to sell her company, Nouvel, to Tenute Del Mondo, a subsidiary of the Stoli group, in 2021, effectively transferring her 50% ownership interest in Miraval. Pitt has fought this sale, claiming the move breached a contract between the two.
""Jolie pursued and then consummated the purported sale in secret, purposely keeping Pitt in the dark, and knowingly violating Pitt's contractual rights,"" according to court documents previously obtained by Fox News Digital.
Pitt is suing Jolie for breach of an implied-in-fact contract; breach of quasi-contract, pleaded in the alternative; breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; abuse of rights under Article 6-1 of the Luxembourg Civil Code; tortious interference with contractual relations; tortious interference with prospective business relations; and constructive trust.
The actor is seeking damages ""in an amount to be proven at trial"" and has requested Jolie's sale be declared ""null and void.""

Pitt also accused the company Jolie sold to of launching a ""hostile takeover"" of Miraval.
""Since claiming to acquire Jolie’s interest in Miraval, Shefler has launched a hostile takeover of the wine business, destabilizing Miraval’s operations and seeking access to Miraval’s confidential and proprietary information for the benefit of his competing enterprise,"" the court documents claimed.

Nouvel accused Pitt of ""hijacking"" Château Miraval and ""wasting"" the company's assets on unnecessary renovation projects, including spending $1 million on swimming pool renovations, according to the court documents previously obtained by Fox News Digital.

The ""Girl, Interrupted"" actress's former company also slammed Pitt's claim he ""built"" the wine business into a profitable company.
""Pitt is an actor, not a winemaker,"" the documents say. ""He deals in illusions, not dirt and grapes. During the years that he allegedly 'built' the business, he filmed and appeared in dozens of movies, not to mention making countless promotional appearances, jet-setting around the world for movie premieres, and attending Hollywood parties. While he no doubt visited the vineyards to admire the work of the French laborers who actually made the business successful, Pitt is no vigneron.""

While the former couple's winery battle rages on, Pitt and Jolie have also yet to finalize their divorce.
Pitt hasn't let that stop him from moving on. The actor is in a ""good place"" and getting serious with Ines de Ramon, who is 27 years younger. They were first romantically linked in November 2022.

"March 9, 2024 10:00am EST","Hackers use pirated software to hijack Mac, Android and Windows devices",Fox News,"‘The Cyberguy’ Kurt Knutsson shares tips for how to combat evolving and sophisticated cyber scams.
Trading in cryptocurrency? You might be sitting on a pretty penny in that digital wallet of yours. Feels great, doesn't it? But here's the catch with digital currency: Keeping it secure isn't a walk in the park.
Hackers are out there, working overtime to come up with new tricks to swipe your crypto, potentially emptying your wallet in one fell swoop. Yep, for these cyber thieves, your digital cash is the ultimate prize. And the worst part? Most of the time, you won't even realize you've been hit until your balance is zero.
Case in point: There's this fresh malware out there, specifically targeting macOS, Android and Windows devices. It sneaks in through pirated software, hunting for your cryptocurrency to make it its own. Here's how it works.

The cybersecurity company Kaspersky has uncovered a sophisticated new malware campaign designed to pilfer cryptocurrency from users' wallets. This campaign leverages pirated or improperly licensed software as a vector for infection, exploiting the common practice of seeking out ""free"" versions of paid software online.
These cracked applications, distributed through unauthorized websites, are embedded with a Trojan-Proxy type of malware. This malware is not limited to just macOS users, as recent findings have shown; variants targeting Android and Windows platforms have also been discovered, connecting to the same Command and Control (C&C) server. These variants, like their macOS counterparts, are concealed within cracked software, illustrating the widespread risk across different operating systems.

Once the malware is downloaded onto your device, it will immediately start checking for Bitcoin and Exodus cryptocurrency wallets. If it discovers either one (which is very unfortunate for some users who have both), the malware replaces the wallet and infects it with another version that's able to steal the cryptocurrency. For some people, this could amount to thousands of dollars. And, it's all because you unintentionally downloaded the malware to your macOS, Android and Windows devices.

Kaspersky reported that this new malware is coming through cracked software applications online. A cracked software has broken protection, thus making it easier for hackers to infiltrate it with code. With this, the malware’s creator took pre-compromised versions of the pirated software — one example being xScope, a paid macOS utility — and altered a few bytes of code to get the job done.
Then, in February, security firm Jamf found another cryptocurrency-focused macOS malware circulating through a pirated version of Apple's Final Cut Pro software.
Attackers can use this malware to gain money or perform criminal activities using your device. It is distributed as .PKG installers, which contain scripts that execute after installation, altering system files and setting up the malware to run as a system process.
The pirated applications are versions of software that have been modified to remove or disable features that are only available in paid versions, such as license verification. These applications are often distributed illegally and without the consent of the software creator. These are identified as being loaded with this Trojan-Proxy malware:

Furthermore, the malware campaign extends beyond macOS, as shown by the fact that Android and Windows platforms are also being targeted by malware that communicates with the same command and control server. The applications or files identified for these platforms are:
The lesson is to avoid downloading pirated software from unauthorized sources to protect yourself from such malware infections.

When you download one of these apps, it launches ""Activator,"" which prompts you to put in your device's username and password to install and launch the software, when you think you're installing an app.
When this happens successfully (or, rather — unsuccessfully to you), the hacker can spy on your device and receive commands from their server. This is when the hacker executes their dirty work: searching for cryptocurrency wallets, replacing them and looting your dough.

Another note that Kaspersky mentioned about this particular malware is that it has been targeting users with the macOS Ventura 13.6, which was just released in September. We don't know for sure, but this seems to suggest that if you're not running that, then you might be safe from this hack, this time.
Of course, if you also don't have cryptocurrency, you're probably okay, too. However, this unique type of malware that uses pirated software to get on your device is not all that new. Hackers have used this method of exploiting pirated software before, and they'll do it again.

Remember, for the hacker to get the malware on your device, you have to download it. This is done by clicking on a link or a file that's generally suspicious, but not always. In the case of this threat, hackers understand that cryptocurrency users are probably more tech-savvy than the average person, and are therefore more attuned to hacks that are out there. Because of this, hackers have to find ways to trick you into downloading the malware in the first place. So here are five things you can do to protect yourself.
1) Don’t download bootleg software: It's not worth the risk to download bootleg software. It exposes your device to potential security threats, such as viruses and spyware. Downloading software from reputable app stores is definitely the way to go to protect your devices.
2) Don’t click on suspicious links or files: If you encounter a link that looks suspicious, misspelled or unfamiliar, avoid clicking on it. Instead, consider going directly to the company’s website by manually typing in the web address or searching for it in a trusted search engine. Typically, the first or second result that appears is legitimate.
3) Update your device with software regularly: Regularly updating your device’s software is crucial for security because it ensures that you receive the latest patches, bug fixes and security enhancements. These updates help protect your device from vulnerabilities and potential threats that could be exploited by malicious actors.
4) Consider storing your cryptocurrency wallet in an external hard drive: If you do have cryptocurrency, you can always consider storing your wallet in an external hard drive. This storage method means that it's safe from hackers on the internet.
5) Have good antivirus software: The best way to protect yourself from clicking malicious links that install malware that may get access to your private information is to have antivirus protection installed on all your devices. This can also alert you of any phishing emails or ransomware scams. Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Mac, Windows, Android & iOS devices.
A new day comes with new malware that’s targeting those of you who use Mac, Windows and Android devices and who have cryptocurrency wallets. It’s a scary threat that could cost you a lot of money if you’re not careful. But you can protect yourself by following the steps above, so you can enjoy your cryptocurrency without worrying about losing it to hackers.

Fast Picker 4.0 (ZenRobotics) (Kurt ""CyberGuy"" Knutsson)
MORE: NO HUMAN NEEDED HERE - HOW THIS ROBOT BUILDS WALLS ALL BY ITSELF
These robots are the brainchild of ZenRobotics, a global leader in smart robotic recycling. The company has recently launched its fourth generation of waste sorting robots, called ZenRobotics 4.0, which have new features and upgraded AI to optimize and improve the efficiency of waste sorting operations. So, what are these improvements, and how do they work? Let’s take a closer look at the two models of ZenRobotics 4.0: the Heavy Picker 4.0 and the Fast Picker 4.0.
Heavy Picker 4.0 (ZenRobotics) (Kurt ""CyberGuy"" Knutsson)

The Heavy Picker 4.0 is a multipurpose waste sorting robot that can handle bulky materials such as wood, metal, plastic and cardboard. It is capable of sorting items weighing up to 88 pounds each, making up to 2,300 picks per hour for each robot on a sorting line. It has a compact individual recognition system (ZenBrain) that enhances precision and increases efficiency by 60%-100% compared to ZenRobotics’ previous system.
Heavy Picker 4.0 (ZenRobotics) (Kurt ""CyberGuy"" Knutsson)
The Heavy Picker 4.0 also benefits from upgraded AI technology with an advanced global recognition database that empowers the robots to identify more than 500 waste categories. This significantly reduces setup times as the Heavy Picker 4.0 will come pre-trained to recognize various types of waste. The upgraded AI also improves motion control and gives the Heavy Picker 4.0 the ability to prioritize picking the item that has the most value to the customer.

The Fast Picker 4.0 is a high-speed waste sorting robot that is ideal for lightweight materials such as paper, plastic and aluminum. It has the Heavy Picker beat at a rate of 80 picks per minute or 4,800 picks per hour. This is double the average pick rate of a human sorter, which is 30-40 picks per minute.
However, the Fast Picker 4.0 has a maximum lifting capacity of 2.2 pounds. The upgraded AI on the Fast Picker 4.0 leverages higher rates of purity, accuracy and recovery, and like the Heavy Picker 4.0, it is able to recognize more than 500 waste categories.
Fast Picker 4.0 (ZenRobotics) (Kurt ""CyberGuy"" Knutsson)
One of the key differences with the Fast Picker 4.0 is the customization it offers with adjustable widths and frame design for seamless integration into various picking stations. The Fast Picker 4.0 reaches the full width of the whole conveyor belt.
Fast Picker 4.0 (ZenRobotics) (Kurt ""CyberGuy"" Knutsson)
The Fast Picker 4.0 can also be added at the end of a line of Heavy Pickers, incorporating into waste streams such as wood, scrap and rigid plastics, and sorting smaller material pieces once the Heavy Pickers have removed the bulky material. The Fast Picker can also be easily integrated into side streams, reject recovery lines and quality control.

Waste operators know how challenging it is to sort and recover valuable materials from the mixed waste streams. Manual sorting is slow, expensive and risky, and it often results in low-quality recyclables that end up in landfills or incinerators. That’s where waste-sorting robots come in. They can reduce a company's carbon footprint, save natural resources and create a circular economy where nothing is wasted.
ZenRobotics AI-powered robots can sort waste 24/7, with high speed and accuracy. They can identify and extract different types of materials, such as metals, plastics, wood, paper and more, and even find new value in waste that might be otherwise overlooked. By using ZenRobotics, companies can generate more revenue from waste, cut operational costs and meet the increasing recycling targets and regulations.

What’s it going to do next? Well, that’s up to the people who program like some high school students in Longmont, Colorado.
LONGMONT, COLORADO. – Students and teachers in Colorado are experimenting with artificial intelligence, or AI, in the classroom.
High school students in Longmont, Colorado, are learning how to design their own AI model projects at the St. Vrain Valley School District Innovation Center. The program started this past fall.
Mai Vu, the A.I. Program manager at St. Vrain Valley School District, said the AI program's goal is to teach students how to use AI to solve real-world problems.
""It's everywhere, from the music they listen to, Spotify, from what they are seeing on Netflix, but they just don't know that AI is working in the background,"" Vu said.

""A big part of the AI self-driving car curriculum is camera-based detection, like detecting a stop sign or a stop light,"" Buchanan said.
Vu said one of her AI program partners is The AI Education Project, a 5-year non-profit. Christian Pinedo, The AI Education Project chief of staff, said his non-profit works with schools across the country, guiding teachers and administrators on how to use AI responsibly.
His non-profit works with school districts in New York, Maryland, Florida, Texas, California, Colorado, and Ohio, according to Pinedo.

Oh, and let's not forget about tucking them away in a cozy, encrypted password manager. The advice list is never-ending.
But here's a kicker. What if you tick all those boxes and your password still ends up in the wrong hands? I know it sounds like we're going overboard, but it's a legitimate worry. How can you keep yourself safe from all the password-stealing scams out there and the damage that can potentially come with that?
The truth is, you can never keep yourself 100% safe from anything. But you can try your best. It starts by taking a step back and understanding the ways that your password, emails and usernames could be potentially compromised.

Theoretically, there are many ways that hackers can go about stealing your password and other login information, especially when it comes to tricking you into giving it to them. But, all the methods go back to the basics. Here are some of the methods hackers employ to steal passwords from innocent people like you and me.
Password spraying: This isn't always successful, but attackers may attempt to log in to your accounts by trying random common passwords and seeing if anything hits.
Credential stuffing: Hackers test databases or lists of stolen credentials against multiple accounts to see if there’s a match. If you use the same password across different sites, these hackers have a good chance of finding a match.
Phishing: Phishing attempts are one of the most common ways that hackers can get your password. It's a social engineering tactic where they attempt to trick you into providing your login credentials. Phishing often takes place through emails or messages, perhaps telling you that you missed a payment or your credit card will be charged soon. In a panic, you contact them to resolve the issue, sometimes not realizing you gave away your information to a scammer until it's too late.
THE VERY WORST AND WEAKEST PASSWORDS OF 2023
Extortion: Extortion is more aggressive when hackers demand passwords through threats or blackmail.
Keyloggers: Another way is to get you to download malware onto your device, which is capable of capturing everything you type, including your passwords.
Brute force attacks: This is a trial-and-error method of stealing passwords by employing an algorithm that attempts to crack passwords by trying every possible combination.
Local discovery: This is when hackers are physically able to find your passwords that are written down or stored insecurely. Perhaps they break into your home and steal a list of passwords on a notepad in your office desk drawer. Or, they find a way to use malware to hack into your password storage software. This is scary as those are meant to be trusted, but it can happen.
Once hackers get the information they need, they can access your various accounts – including bank accounts – and potentially wreak havoc on your finances and other aspects of your life.

MORE: THE VERY WORST AND WEAKEST PASSWORDS
In addition to the basics we mentioned earlier – like changing your passwords often – there are other strategies you can use to help protect yourself.
Use strong, unique passwords: This is one you probably know, but your password should be long (more than 12 characters) and contain a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers and symbols (and whatever you're allowed to use on the platform it is). Consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords.
Reset your password often: Sometimes, forgetting your password isn't all that bad. Okay, kidding. But the reason I mention this is because the more often you reset or change your password, the harder it is for hackers to guess it.
Enable two-factor authentication: Most banks and other platforms that hold your sensitive data already have 2FA incorporated into their system, but sometimes, you do need to set it up yourself. This adds an extra layer of security to your accounts by sending a code to your device or email address. It's easy once you get it going and can keep your account extra secure.
Check your bank accounts often: One of the most common reasons that a hacker tries to steal your password is to have access to your bank account. Check your activities and statements often to make sure no one is using your account or card to buy anything, and let your bank know of any suspicious or fraudulent activities.
GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE
Don't download suspicious apps: This goes without saying, but if you're downloading an app from a third-party app store or someone sends you an invitation to download an app, it is best not to do it.
Don’t use public devices or sensitive information: If you must use a public or someone else's device (for instance, a computer at the library), create a guest user account, use private browsing and sign out of your account before leaving the device and clearing the history.
Be careful on public Wi-Fi: In addition to being careful with which devices you use, you also need to be cautious connecting to public Wi-Fi. Hackers lurk in these places, waiting for people to connect to these often unsecured networks, allowing them to creep in and steal your information.
Do regular software updates on your devices: Clever hackers can find ways to install malware on your device. But by doing software updates regularly, you stay one step ahead of their tricks. These updates patch security vulnerabilities, strengthen defenses and ensure your digital fortress remains resilient against their cunning tactics.
Have good antivirus software: The best way to protect yourself from clicking malicious links that install malware that may get access to your private information is to have antivirus protection installed and actively running on all your devices. This can also alert you of any phishing emails or ransomware scams. Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices.

MORE: HOW TO ENSURE YOUR PASSWORDS DON'T DIE WITH YOU
If you try all of these methods and find out your password has still been stolen, don't fret. Keep an eye on your accounts, report any identity theft or fraud to the FTC, and reset all your passwords with new, stronger passwords as quickly as possible.

Remember, no security measure is 100% foolproof, but these steps can significantly reduce your risk of being hacked. Stay safe. Any hacker who is determined to steal your password will try nearly every attempt they can think of to get it. But by following the tips above, you can keep yourself that much safer until the hacker moves onto a target who is not as safe.

"March 10, 2024 10:00am EDT",How imposters are trying to exploit your grief and wallet in a new funeral scam,Fox News,"FOX News correspondent Danamarie McNicholl joins 'FOX News Live' with details on how Americans can protect themselves from scammers.
Just when you thought you’d seen the worst of humanity, scammers have managed to reach a new low.
You thought the Facebook scam about how scammers are commandeering people’s Facebook profiles with fake bereavement posts was terrible? It gets worse.
A woman grieving and hugging a man  (Kurt ""CyberGuy"" Knutsson )
While the Facebook post scam ran with fake bereavement posts to glean information about supportive friends, families and even strangers, this new scam targets actual surviving family members of those recently deceased. The scammers reach out to families pretending to be from funeral homes and demand more payment or threaten the cancellation of the funeral.

It is easy to see how distraught loved ones might fall for such scams as they are already under immense stress from losing a loved one. While the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has alerted those in the funeral industry, below are some key steps you can take to prevent you or anyone you care about from falling for this horrendous scam.
As with most scams, these charlatans are banking on the fact that any urgency they present you with will prevent you from thinking first. They are hoping that catching you in a vulnerable state and giving you an ultimatum will result in action taken before the victim or their family can think it through.
This scam is especially insidious because who would think of preying on family members of someone who is recently deceased? Forewarned is forearmed. So, hopefully, knowing this scam has been committed will give you pause if you should run into such a situation.
Man on the phone  (Kurt ""CyberGuy"" Knutsson)
Anyone can change the name of their outgoing number (the phone number you are getting a call from) so it may even say in the caller ID that it is from the funeral home you have employed.
If you are uncertain, tell them you will call them right back and hang up the phone. Find the number on the estimate or invoice you received directly from the funeral home and call to verify what is going on. The funeral home’s contact information can be found on the general price list the funeral home provided.
SCAMMERS ARE USING FAKE NEWS, MALICIOUS LINKS TO TARGET YOU IN AN EMOTIONAL FACEBOOK PHISHING TRAP
Scammers don’t make the urgent payment needed easy to give. They have a tendency to request odd things like a wire transfer, gift cards, cryptocurrency or even a check payback, where they send you a check claiming there was a clerical or mechanical error with their bank, have you deposit the check then have you send it back.
This is all to stop the money from being traced back to them or prevent you from recovering your money. The funeral home should have gone over the types of payments accepted when the general price list was provided. If there is a strong deviation from the most common forms of payment, hang up.

While life is full of surprises, funeral homes should not be. They are regulated by the FTC to provide explicit pricing and information to consumers. A full explanation of the FTC’s oversight in this arena can be found under the ""funeral rule.""
As mentioned in No. 2 of this list, each funeral provider is required to provide a general price list, which should disclose fees for any services involved in a funeral and pricing for most aspects of the funeral. If a scammer calls claiming new fees for services or items, remember that all those factors would have been provided to you with the general price list and agreed upon when hiring the funeral home.

While it may seem worthwhile to give the scammer a tongue-lashing, it is not worth your time, energy and further violation of privacy. You do not know what information these scammers are gathering during the conversation, and it is best to hang up as soon as possible and report it to the FTC here.
Consider using an identity theft protection service to shield yourself from potential scams, especially those related to funeral fraud. This is more for you than the deceased's personal and financial information.
Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security Number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.

Consider these essential precautions to safeguard your family’s privacy and financial well-being from scammers after a loved one has died.
Craft obituaries mindfully: When writing an obituary, omit sensitive details that could be exploited for identity theft. Avoid including the deceased’s date and place of birth, middle name, maiden name, mother’s maiden name and home address. Additionally, refrain from mentioning the date and time of the funeral to prevent potential burglaries during the service.
Promptly report to Social Security: If a loved one has died, immediately notify the Social Security Administration by calling 800-772-1213. This step ensures benefits are appropriately handled.
Inform the IRS: Send a copy of the death certificate to the IRS. This allows officials to flag the deceased’s tax account, preventing any fraudulent activity.
Notify financial institutions: Reach out to banks and other financial institutions where the late loved one had accounts. If you decide to close these accounts, request that they be marked as ""Closed: Account holder is deceased.""
GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE
Alert credit bureaus: Contact the major credit bureaus — Equifax, Experian and TransUnion — to have them place a death notice in the deceased’s credit file. This step helps prevent unauthorized credit applications.
Monitor credit reports: Obtain a copy of the deceased’s credit report shortly after death and again a few months later. Regular checks can help detect any fraudulent activity.
Dealing with debts: Don’t let debt collectors intimidate you into paying financial obligations for a late spouse, parent or sibling. Generally, the estate is responsible for debts, not the survivors. However, there are exceptions for cosigned loans and jointly held financial accounts. For specific guidance, consult the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
Exercise caution with contacts: Be cautious if you receive communication from ""long-lost"" relatives or friends of the deceased, especially on social media. Verify their identity by asking family and old friends if they recognize the person.
Scammers have a knack for finding new ways to prey on the vulnerable. While fending off scammers is the last thing on one’s mind while grieving the loss of a loved one, it is important to stay informed and empowered so that your time and energy are spent on what really matters — remembering our lost loved ones.

"March 11, 2024 10:00am EDT",How crypto imposters are using Calendly to infect Macs with malware,Fox News,"Kurt Knutsson helps you learn how to save money by finding and canceling your unused or unwanted subscriptions on your iPhone in six easy steps.
A new hacking threat is targeting crypto users via Calendly, a popular meeting-scheduling app. This is a serious issue that could compromise your security and privacy, so you need to be aware of how it works and how to protect yourself.

Calendly app (Calendly) (Kurt ""CyberGuy"" Knutsson)
The way this particular threat works is rather straightforward, yet sneaky. To start, many people in the crypto world are seeking investments to support their crypto start-up ideas or something related.
People like this need to be active in crypto communities and investment spaces to connect with the right people to support them. It's not uncommon for these people to have a link to schedule a meeting with them on their profile, via Calendly, a popular scheduling app not just for people in cryptocurrency but for anyone.
Calendly app (Calendly) (Kurt ""CyberGuy"" Knutsson)
Unbeknownst to the soon-to-be victim, these hackers are taking advantage of these individuals by posing as crypto investors, the exact kind of people these folks want to get in touch with. When they book a meeting on this person's calendar, they add a meeting link that runs a script that installs malware on macOS systems.
This happened to one unlucky person in this situation. The hacker reached out via Telegram – an encrypted messaging app – and asked about booking a meeting. The person sent the ""investor"" their Calendly link, and on the day of the meeting, went to the meeting link that the ""investor"" had added. In most cases, this is normal – a link to a Zoom or Google Meet is not unusual. And because the user had already spoken to the person via Telegram and seemed legitimate, there was no reason to think twice about this.
Only when the person went to click the link and when the ""investor"" didn't show up, did he contact him on the same Telegram thread. The ""investor"" apologized for the inconvenience and sent a new link, explaining there was an issue with IT.
However, the link still did not work, and the meeting never happened, with the ""investor"" asking to reschedule. It dawned on the person a little afterward that this may have been a hack attack, via an Apple Script (file extension "".scpt"") that downloads and executes a malicious Trojan made to run on macOS systems.

MORE: STEALTHY BACKDOOR MAC MALWARE THAT CAN WIPE OUT YOUR FILES
Because the person who was the target of this attack promptly backed up their data upon realizing the attack, it prevented the loss of evidence regarding the actual malware downloaded onto their macOS. Cybersecurity firms were able to analyze the script information, which led them to identify similarities with previous attacks carried out by the same group and warn the public.
Security alert (SlowMist) (Kurt ""CyberGuy"" Knutsson)
MORE: HOW TO PROTECT YOUR MAC FROM THE NEW METASTEALER MALWARE
A cybersecurity firm discovered a phishing attack in 2023 that was carried out by state-sponsored hackers from North Korea, specifically a subgroup of the notorious Lazarus group. This group typically targets financial gains, aiming to steal money or cryptocurrency to fund the North Korean military regime.
In this particular attack, the North Korean hackers exploited the ""Add Custom Link"" feature within the Calendly meeting scheduling system on event pages to insert malicious links and initiate phishing attacks. They also employ similar tactics on Telegram.
This incident underscores the importance of vigilance and robust security measures to safeguard against cyberthreats, especially those originating from state-sponsored actors.
Add Custom Link feature (SlowMist) (Kurt ""CyberGuy"" Knutsson)
We reached out to Calendly, and their CISO (chief information security officer), Frank Russo, provided us with this statement.
""We’re aware of these types of social engineering attacks by cryptocurrency hackers. This attack violates our Terms of Use, and accounts are immediately terminated when discovered or reported. To help prevent these kinds of attacks, our security team and partners have implemented a service to automatically detect fraud and impersonations that could lead to social engineering. We are also actively scanning content for all our customers to catch these types of malicious links and to prevent hackers earlier on. Additionally, we intend to add an interstitial page warning users before they’re redirected away from Calendly to other websites. We are continuously strengthening the cybersecurity of our platform to protect our customers.""
MacOS users tend to experience fewer malware attacks than PC users. But this idea can make MacOS users more vulnerable to attacks because they may feel they are simply safe. Because hackers are getting more and more sophisticated, it's important never to let your guard down and to follow these precautions.
Be cautious with links: If you receive a Calendly link from an unfamiliar sender, refrain from clicking on any embedded links, even if the sender appears trustworthy. Additionally, exercise vigilance when dealing with phishing emails or messages related to crypto exchanges or wallets, as they may contain malicious attachments or links with malware. When using Calendly, take note of the source and domain of any links you encounter on the interface. Before clicking, hover your mouse over the text to verify the link address and avoid accessing potentially harmful phishing links.
Send meeting links yourself: Whenever possible, send the meeting link directly to the person scheduling the call. This minimizes the risk of accidentally clicking on malicious links.
Have good antivirus software: The best way to protect yourself from clicking malicious links that install malware that may get access to your private information is to have antivirus protection installed on all your devices. This can also alert you of any phishing emails or ransomware scams. Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Mac, Windows, Android & iOS devices.
Perform regular updates: Regularly update your operating system and security software to stay ahead of potential vulnerabilities.
Have strong passwords and use two-factor authentication: Using the same password across multiple platforms will always make you more vulnerable because if one account gets hacked, they all get hacked. And two-factor authentication is just an extra shield that will prevent a hacker from getting into your accounts. Make sure to use a password manager to keep track of all your passwords.

Sloan Mattingly, the 7-year-old Indiana girl who died on a South Florida beach last month after a sand hole caved in on her and her brother, was remembered as a ""beam of light"" by her parents, who discussed the ""chaos and horror"" that unfolded on the family vacation during a Thursday interview.
Jason and Therese Mattingly appeared on ABC’s ""Good Morning America"" to warn families of the potential dangers of digging deep holes in the sand, describing the tragedy as a ""blur.""
""In my mind, I had her in my hands, but the weight of the sand was too much,"" Jason said, adding that it all ""happened so fast.""
""It didn’t matter that we were literally right there,"" Therese said. ""It was just a hole and then there’s nothing. And then it just became chaos and horror.""

Sloan was digging a 5- to 6-feet deep hole with her 9-year-old brother, Maddox, in Lauderdale-by-the-Sea, Florida, while on vacation with their family, when the sand hole suddenly caved in. Sloan was buried alive in the sand while Maddox was covered nearly up to his neck.

Dramatic video posted online showed several beachgoers frantically trying to dig through the sand and reach Sloan. They were trying to hold on to the walls of the hole, so it would not collapse further. The fire department said it used support boards to keep more sand from collapsing in as they used shovels to dig the children out.

Experts say that deep sand holes are dangerous because if they cave in, the sand becomes compact, trapping anyone caught in the collapse under a tremendous weight that can deprive them of oxygen.
The Mattinglys said that they do not blame anyone for the tragedy, thanking the witnesses who raced to help dig out the children, the first responders and the hospital. Therese also wanted to apologize to those who witnessed what she described as the ""pure horror"" of that day.

After no one let him out, the man urinated in a corner, according to the document. Green is accused of threatening to beat up the man with a phone and demanding that he ""lick it up,"" according to prosecutors.

California killer Scott Peterson returned to court Tuesday with his new lawyers as he seeks to overturn his 2004 conviction for the murders of his pregnant wife, Laci, and their unborn child – a crime he maintains he did not commit.
Peterson, 51, appeared remotely from Ione, California's Mule Creek State Prison wearing a blue button-down shirt and asked the court for permission to appear remotely in future proceedings.
He was initially sentenced to death for the murders, and while the sentence was later overturned, his appeal for a new trial has failed in the past.
Peterson, whose look has changed repeatedly over the two decades he has been behind bars, traded in his slicked hair and salt-and-pepper stubble for a clean shave, and he had his hair pulled back in a short ponytail.

Key evidence against Scott Peterson:

The hearing largely addressed scheduling for a number of upcoming hearings – on motions to seal documents, conduct new DNA testing and post-conviction discovery.

Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey has called on the state’s juvenile justice system to be reformed after a teen slammed a girl’s head into the pavement near a high school last Friday during a violent brawl that was caught on video.
Bailey was interviewed on the local radio program Wake Up Mid-Missouri Monday morning to discuss the brutal assault that sent a teen girl to the hospital in critical condition.

""Well this is horrific, and we’re seeing this happen more and more across the state where juveniles are committing violent crimes,"" the Republican Attorney General said, noting that two juveniles were also charged in a shooting at last month’s Kansas City Chiefs parade, resulting in a woman’s death and nearly two dozen others injured.
Over the weekend, Bailey said the suspect in Friday’s violent brawl should be tried as an adult and charged with murder if the offense rose to a homicide.

""We’ve got to reform our juvenile system to ensure that these sorts of issues are addressed,"" Bailey said.
He pointed to plummeting numbers of juveniles committed to the state’s Division of Youth Services for treatment as evidence that the justice system is not doing its job of prosecuting offenders.
Friday's brawl took place near the intersection of Norgate and Claudine drives, which is near Hazelwood East High School.  (Google Maps)

Leaders of the New York City Fire Department have extinguished prospects for a ""hunt"" for rank-and-file members who jeered the Empire State's Attorney General Letitia James when she took the stage at a ceremony last week.
""At no point has there been an investigation into members booing,"" an FDNY spokesperson told Fox News Wednesday, appearing to contradict reports of an internal email from brass that generated half a week of bad press for the department.
FDNY Chief of Department John Hodgens handed down a fiery list of talking points last week, according to the New York Post, after some members booed James and chanted ""Trump! Trump! Trump!"" as she took the stage during a promotion ceremony at the Christian Cultural Center in Brooklyn.
The behavior was ""unacceptable,"" and members who appeared on video from the event would reportedly be investigated internally.

""BITS is investigating this, so they will figure out who the members are,"" Hodgens was said to have warned in an email to high-ranking FDNY officials Friday. ""I recommend they come forward. I have been told by the Commissioner it will be better for them if they come forward, and we don't have to hunt them down.""
BITS refers to the department's Bureau of Investigation and Trials. Hodgens noted that there was ""clear video"" of the event and that BITS would contact people who declined to come forward.

The purported persecution fired up current and former members of the department's rank and file, as well as the public.
""I think they were making a mountain out of a mole hill,"" said Staten Island attorney Louis Gelormino, who along with partner Mark Fonte, of F&G Legal Group, had offered to represent any firefighters under departmental investigation pro bono.
""Let's put this into perspective: It was a smattering of boos when Letitia James took the stage. It wasn't a real outpouring. It was a smattering at best. And then it was about 15 or 20 seconds of Trump chants. That's it.""

The FDNY has already downplayed reports it was hunting anyone to begin with.
""Nobody is hunting anyone down,"" FDNY spokesman Jim Long told Fox News Digital in an email Sunday. ""We’re looking into those who clearly broke department regulations. It has nothing to do with politics. It’s about professionalism at an official event held in a house of worship.""
The department further softened its language Wednesday.
""FDNY leadership is having ongoing conversations with our members about decorum during department events to ensure we are upholding the core values that make the FDNY the greatest fire department in the world,"" a spokesperson told Fox News. ""Being a NYC firefighter is an honor, and we will continue to impress upon our members that their actions impact everyone who wears the uniform.""

James also sought to lower the temperature Wednesday, telling Politico's Playbook she did not believe anyone should be disciplined for the interruption.
""The events of last Thursday will not diminish my respect for the brave men and women of FDNY,"" she told the outlet. ""I will be with them now, and I will be with them tomorrow.""
Gelormino, the attorney, said it's a positive step by James and FDNY Commissioner Laura Kavanagh for the latest developments but that he stands by his offer to defend FDNY members if the city changes course again.

""I think they will both look like the bigger people if they handle it that way,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""We're prepared to fight if they're not going to handle it that way. Or, hopefully, if that's the case and the fire department can move on and everybody can move on and do what they intended to do, which is to protect the people of New York City, which the men and women of New York City Fire Department do incredibly well.""
Last year, FDNY Local 2507 advised members to immediately ask for a union representative if approached by a BITS officer, warning that investigators had been ""baiting"" members into confrontations that resulted in disciplinary measures.

And Kavanagh has also had a rocky tenure. She was never a firefighter before joining the FDNY as a civilian official in 2017. After becoming commissioner, she feuded with her own former top chiefs last year when they asked to be demoted in response to her policies, according to the Post.
""This is the first time I've ever seen the dirty laundry get aired like this,"" Gelormino said. ""She needs to do a better job of connecting with the rank and file again. The fire department in New York City has never been questioned. They do an incredible job.""

James' office recently took former President Trump to a New York City civil court, resulting in a $350 million ruling against him last month. She also successfully sued former NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre, who was ordered to repay the organization $5 million in misspent funds.

Steven Brown, 44, and Amanda Wallace, 40, appeared briefly in a Suffolk County court Monday, days after their arrests in connection with two sets of chopped up human remains recovered in separate locations.

During his speech, he asked voters to send him to ""Congress"" and bragged about adding to the national debt.
Pennsylvania law enforcement officials announced the arrest of two parents who allegedly starved and physically abused their 1-year-old twins to the point the children almost died.
Delaware County District Attorney Jack Stollsteimer said Tuesday that 23-year-old Armani Coleman and 18-year-old Zamareon Moat face charges of aggravated assault, endangering the welfare of children and conspiracy.
""The actions of these defendants are incomprehensible in their heinousness: they are alleged to have intentionally starved their medically fragile infant daughter to near death and are believed to have inflicted a near fatal head injury on their infant son,"" Stollsteimer said. ""Marks of possible strangulation, as well as bite marks, add to the picture of depravity presented by these defendants. Despite offers of assistance from CYS, the defendants missed dozens of doctor appointments, likely fearful that their abuse would be detected.""
On Jan. 22, 2024, Chesterfield City Police Department officers responded to a report of an unconscious infant, and when they arrived, they met with Coleman, who handed over her one-year-old son.

Police reported the child showed signs of shallow breathing and lethargy.
The parents told investigators the child may have hit his head on a door jamb while crawling. He was taken to Nemours Children’s Hospital and diagnosed with bilateral facial injury due to blunt impact trauma and injuries consistent with shaking or impact events.
The 1-year-old boy also underwent surgery to drain a subdural hemorrhage.

The DA’s office said the child abuse pediatrician examined the child and said the injuries were near fatal.
After examining the boy, the detective proceeded to examine the female twin, who had marks and bruises on her face, as well as numerous scratches on her body.
Moat told investigators the scratches were self-inflicted, though the physician who examined the girl said the location of the scratches did not match the explanation.
The physician also found the child was emaciated and was subject to intentional food restriction, nearly resulting in her death. Doctors saw what appeared to be bite marks on the girl, along with injuries and marks consistent with a method of restraint or strangulation.

Neither parent was employed, and they told police they were the sole caretakers of the twins.
Detectives investigated the content of electronic devices from both parents and allegedly found searches for ""scar removal cream for toddlers,"" ""how to get rid of a bite mark,"" and ""can you tell if a baby been choked.""
The County Department of Children and Youth Services (CYS) told detectives they opened a case on the children after they missed 15 medical appointments.
The DA also said records show both children tested positive for THC when they were born, adding the female twin was a medically fragile child who required oxygen.
CYS reported that the girl did not have the mandatory monitoring equipment in place.

Philadelphia Police arrested two 18-year-old men in connection to a shooting that happened last Wednesday and injured eight high school students getting ready to board a SEPTA bus. At least two other suspects are still at large.
The shooting happened at about 3 p.m. on Wednesday at a SEPTA bus station near the intersection of Cottman and Rising Sun avenues, in the northeast portion of the city.
Several students from Northeast High School were getting ready to board a bus when three gunmen got out of a blue Hyundai Sonata, ran toward the students and opened fire with about 30 rounds before fleeing the scene. Eight students, including one girl and seven boys between the ages of 15-17, were struck multiple times by gunfire. One of the victims, a 16-year-old boy, was shot nine times in the torso.
An investigation into the shooting led to the arrests of Jamaal Tucker and Ahnile Buggs, both 18 years old.

The two men have been charged with attempted murder, eight counts of aggravated assault, eight counts of recklessly endangering another person and several other charges for their involvement in the shooting.
Police also identified the victims only by their ages, saying a 15-year-old male sustained two gunshot wounds to the left arm and one to the upper back; a 15-year-old male was shot once in the lower back; a 16-year-old male suffered gunshot wounds to the chest, right leg and right arm; a 16-year-old male sustained nine gunshots to the torso; a 16-year-old female was shot once in the buttocks and right thigh; a 17-year-old male was shot once in the left leg; a 16-year-old male was shot once in the left leg; and a 16-year-old was shot once in the upper back.
On Monday, Mayor Cherelle Parker was joined by Philadelphia Police Commissioner Kevin Bethel, District Attorney Larry Krasner, and others, including representatives from the FBI and ATF, to announce progress in the investigation.

She said the collaboration between the police department and all other agencies will continue to be standard operational procedures as long as violent crimes continue to occur in the city.
Bethel said the crime last Wednesday was ""heinous,"" requiring the department to make a ""full court press"" by reaching out to agencies like the FBI and ATF to track down the suspects.

The investigation led to the discovery of two stolen vehicles which were seized and searched for evidence. As a result of the evidence found, investigators developed suspects, and on Friday, police executed search warrants in several places and Tucker turned himself in.
Police said the investigation did not stop there, and another suspect was developed, leading to search and arrest warrants being served on Buggs.
Investigators allegedly recovered a loaded .40 caliber Glock pistol with a laser and Glock switch, turning the semi-automatic pistol into a fully-automatic pistol.

Deputy Commissioner Frank Vanore told reporters investigators believe two of the four people that were in the blue Hyundai on the day of the shooting were in custody, adding they are not done.
Vanore said there are others, including suspects and those who aided or assisted them, who will be targeted next.

District Attorney Larry Krasner said his department, the police, and other agencies involved are not going to stop with two people getting arrested, or even just four involved in this particular crime. Instead, he said, everyone involved in the investigation will not be done until any group involved in violent acts like the shooting at the bus stop are stopped.
Krasner encouraged anyone who may have been a witness to the crime to reach out to the Philadelphia Police Department first, then his office. But for those involved, he had another message.

The Boeing whistleblower found dead in Charleston, South Carolina, in between depositions over the weekend showed no indications he would take his own life and was in good spirits, according to his attorneys.
John Barnett, a 62-year-old longtime Boeing employee who went public with safety concerns he said he uncovered at the North Charleston plant, died Saturday, a day after sitting for a deposition with the company's lawyers. He was supposed to answer more questions but failed to show up. Then police made a grim discovery.
Charleston police said in a statement they responded to the Holiday Inn on Savannah Highway and found Barnett dead in his truck around 10:20 a.m. Saturday. He had a gunshot wound to the head and was pronounced dead at the scene.

""He was in very good spirits and really looking forward to putting this phase of his life behind him and moving on,"" the attorneys said. ""We didn't see any indication he would take his own life. No one can believe it.""
Barnett worked for Boeing for over three decades before retiring in 2017 as a quality control engineer. In 2019, Barnett told the BBC that Boeing would rush to get its 787 Dreamliner jets off the production line, compromising safety.
He alleged the emergency oxygen systems on the jets had a failure rate of 25%. This meant that a quarter of 787 Dreamliners had the potential to rapidly lose oxygen if the cabins were suddenly decompressed, suffocating passengers.

""Detectives are actively investigating this case and are awaiting the formal cause of death, along with any additional findings that might shed further light on the circumstances surrounding the death of Mr. Barnett.""
Barnett said he learned of the issue while working at Boeing's North Charleston plant in 2010 and claimed to have raised the issue with management to no avail. Instead of tackling the issue, his lawyers allege, the company retaliated against him and subjected him to a hostile work environment, leading to the lawsuit for which he was being deposed.
The Federal Aviation Administration reviewed Boeing in 2017, corroborated some of Barnett's allegations and ordered the company to take action.
In a statement, Boeing told FOX Business, ""We are saddened by Mr. Barnett’s passing, and our thoughts are with his family and friends.""

This past January, Barnett told TMZ he was concerned that Boeing was returning its 737 Max 9 jets to the sky too quickly, after the incident in which an Alaska Airlines jet's door panel blew off midflight.
""John was a brave, honest man of the highest integrity,"" the lawyers said. ""He cared dearly about his family, his friends, the Boeing company, his Boeing co-workers, and the pilots and people who flew on Boeing aircraft. We have rarely met someone with a more sincere and forthright character.""

Several bodycam videos show police officers ending foot chases and taking down emotionally disturbed gunmen after shots rang out by wrapping them in wires from a distance.
The responding officers immobilize out-of-control suspects, who appear to be going through a mental health crisis or were on drugs, without hurting their targets and de-escalate situations that in the past might have spiraled out of control and ended in deaths.
It's part of a ""High Purpose Police Movement"" that coincides with increased police run-ins with erratic suspects, who are 10 times more likely to be involved in a fatal law enforcement confrontation, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI).
Fairfax County, Virginia, Police Chief Kevin Davis said it ""prioritizes safety and emphasizes de-escalation"" and it's ""expected to transform our incident resolution capacity, especially in crisis situations.""

As tools are pulled from law enforcement's toolbox, including physical restraints like certain choke holds, which are banned in about half the states, they need to be replaced.
That's where technology, like the hand-held restraint device dubbed ""the Bola"" comes in.
In several bodycam videos of police in Mountlake Terrace, Washington state, which were shared with Fox News Digital, responding officers yell commands like ""Prepping Bola"" before launching the device.

A couple of shots were heard in the background, but no one was injured, and the video shows the captured suspect wrapped like a Spider-Man villain and taken into custody.

""Thousands of people who get in violent altercations with police each year are battling a mental health crisis,"" Cohen told Fox News Digital. ""Our tools don’t hurt people to get them the help they need, whereas other tools that have been used in the past rely on pain-compliance.""
""While there are surely many cases where force is the only way to subdue a suspect, there are many others where force is not necessary.""

A California man who Googled ""how to kill your ex’s fiancé"" was convicted Monday of killing a Catholic high school teacher.
San Diego County prosecutors said Jesse Alvarez, 33, gunned down Mario Fierro as he was leaving his home to go to work at Cathedral Catholic High School on Feb. 1, 2021. He was found guilty of first-degree murder.
Prosecutors said Alvarez killed Fierro out of jealousy after he learned the victim had gotten engaged with his ex-girlfriend, Amy Gembara, also a Cathedral Catholic teacher.

After learning Gembara and Fierro had gotten engaged, Alvarez began plotting the murder, prosecutors said. He planned and researched how to commit the slaying by ambushing him outside his apartment.
""'I was brewing anger' — his words. Yes he was. And he continued to brew anger. And what else did he say? That he wanted Mr. Fierro gone or dead,"" Deputy District Attorney Ramona McCarthy told the jury.
To plan the killing, Alvarez made several Google searches on how to get away with the murder.

""As far as the Google searches are concerned, it definitely was a big piece of evidence in this case,"" McCarthy said after the verdict was read.
Alvarez claimed he approached Fierro and introduced himself. Fierro got angry and threatened to kill him, he said. Alvarez said he tried to calm Fierro down before pulling out a gun.
""If this is premeditated, then he’s just shooting him right away. He’s not trying to talk to him, not trying to make conversation,"" said defense attorney Peter Blair.
Fierro was shot six times — four times in the head, prosecutors said, while dismissing Alvarez's claims of self-defense.

A California couple and their two-year-old daughter survived a crash landing in their small plane last week after losing engine power and deploying the aircraft’s parachute to slow their descent into a mountainous area, authorities said.
The man and woman, both 38, and their toddler walked away with only minor cuts and scratches after the single-engine 2004 Cirrus SR22 crashed in a forested area of Whitethorn around 1:15 p.m. on Friday, the Mendocino County Sheriff’s Office said in a news release.
The plane’s engine lost power about five minutes after taking off, according to the sheriff’s office, and as the pilot began to troubleshoot, he noticed that the plane’s altitude was too low for recovery.
He then deployed the aircraft’s Cirrus Airframe Parachute System to slow the plane’s descent, officials said. The parachute carried the aircraft until it crashed among the trees.

The Fort Lauderdale mayor welcomed spring break with open arms before the annual March madness, and party seekers flocked to the city's beach in droves.
Drone footage, which was first published by The U.S. Sun, showed large crowds of co-eds sprawled out across the beach, and a fun beach boxing bout with gloves, a ref and an overexcited crowd cheering them on.
City police and the mayor's chief of staff told Fox News Digital it was a ""successful"" first week, with limited crime, as they brace for a tougher challenge this weekend, which coincides with St. Patrick's Day.
""Our spring break crowds have been as expected so far this year, with this week being the busiest week we are anticipating,"" Casey Liening, spokesperson for the Fort Lauderdale police, told Fox News Digital. ""We have not had any major issues or disturbances.""

A video of a wild melee involving dozens of women supposedly on a Fort Lauderdale beach went viral on social media, particularly X, and was picked up by multiple news outlets.
It's unclear where the video originated or where and when the actual altercation took place.
Police and city officials told Fox News Digital in separate interviews that the reports are inaccurate. Both pointed to a pier in the background of the video and said the city's beach doesn't have a pier.
""Generally, I can tell you that our officers have and will continue to disperse any crowds we observe,"" Fort Lauderdale police's spokesperson told Fox News Digital in an email.

Meanwhile, Miami Beach's purposely draconian guidelines appeared to be effective during the first week of ""March madness,"" with local outlets reporting it was a quiet opening weekend.
Miami Beach took drastic action following last year's mayhem, when two people were fatally shot, and police made 500 arrests (including 230 felony arrests) and seized 105 guns.

The U.S. Sun, which reported from the Fort Lauderdale beach over the weekend, said party-goers were spotted drinking from beer bongs, chugging mixed drinks from jugs and locked in beer pong matches.
Other beach-goers danced, flung Frisbees and footballs, kicked soccer balls and even duked it out in boxing gloves.

Fort Lauderdale Mayor Dean Trantalis said before spring break season started that there were designated areas where alcohol was permitted, as well as safety preventive measures that included roofie tests, rideshare options and accessible Narcan.
""We want to make your spring break experience the best experience you've ever had,"" Trantalis said during a March 4 press conference.
""Why? Because we want you to come back. We want you to come back next year. We want you to come back in future years, and, hey, maybe you want to make Fort Lauderdale your home.""

Meanwhile, spring break in the typical hot spot Miami Beach looked like a busy vacation weekend versus an annual college-age student party mecca.
The city's goal for weeks was to ""break up"" with spring break, which the New York Post said was a ""bust.""
That headline was touted in a post on X by former Mayor Philip Levine who posted the headline with hand-clapping emojis.
The first week of spring break appeared to go according to plan for two major cities in Florida, but the first and last week are historically calmer compared to the middle weekends in March.

Gov. Ron DeSantis said last week he's sending over 140 state troopers, along with various other state resources, to South Florida as part of an ""unprecedented"" pre-emptive strike against spring break crime.
The plan is to send 60 state troopers to reinforce communities throughout South Florida, with a high concentration in Miami Beach, according to the governor.
And 60 more state troopers will mobilize in additional hot spots like Daytona Beach and Panama City Beach, and 24 quick-response troopers will be deployed in Bay, Volusia, Broward and Miami-Dade counties for immediate incidents.

"March 13, 2024 6:30pm EDT","As ruling on DA Fani Willis looms in GA Trump case, defense sources say 'the court is being played'",Fox News,"Fox News legal editor Kerri Kupec Urbahn joined 'America's Newsroom' to discuss the latest on the Fulton County case involving Fani Willis and the DOJ's criminal inquiry into Boeing.
The legal battle around a motion to disqualify Fulton County, Georgia, District Attorney Fani Willis from the case against former President Trump is raising concerns of potential perjury, according to multiple sources from defense teams.
Fox News spoke to several sources involved with the defense in the case against Trump and 18 others charged with attempting to interfere in the 2020 presidential election in Georgia. Many of the sources said that they believe Willis and special prosecutor Nathan Wade lied to the court.
One source puts it this way: ""The court is being played.""

Willis and Wade both testified that their relationship did not begin until early 2022, but the defense argues it can prove the relationship began in 2019. Willis hired Wade in November 2021.
JUDGE DISMISSES SOME COUNTS AGAINST TRUMP IN FANI WILLIS ELECTION INTERFERENCE CASE
During a series of hearings in recent weeks, various defense counsel offered evidence that tried to counter Willis and Wade’s relationship timeline. They also tried to prove that Willis had a financial interest in the case by hiring Wade and going on vacations together without disclosing the relationship.
The deadline to submit new evidence on the disqualification issue has passed, but some defense lawyers have asked Judge Scott McAfee to reopen evidence before he makes a ruling, claiming they have two new witnesses who can testify that the relationship began before Wade was hired.
GEORGIA PROSECUTOR ALLEGES FANI WILLIS ASKED BRADLEY NOT TO TESTIFY ON AFFAIR: ‘THEY ARE COMING AFTER US’
Multiple sources say it’s clear to them that Willis and Wade lied, with one saying, ""The cover-up has gotten a lot worse than the actual crime.""
Another source calls the alleged lying ""disgusting,"" adding that ""these are supposed to be the representatives of law enforcement and justice, and they’re acting like criminals.""

The district attorney’s office said it could not comment on allegations that Willis and Wade lied to the court.
""We cannot make comments about that matter outside of court. We refer you to what was said in court hearings and court filings,"" Dulton County District Attorney's Office spokesperson Jeff DiSantis said.
All of this comes as the country waits for Judge McAfee to make his ruling on whether to disqualify Willis from the case.
JUDGE DISMISSES SOME COUNTS AGAINST TRUMP IN FANI WILLIS ELECTION INTERFERENCE CASE
While sources told Fox News they believe disqualification is the only path forward, they admit it’s now a waiting game.
""It’s like waiting for Christmas. We don’t know if we’re getting a present, or coal,"" one source said.
Another source said that regardless of how the judge rules, ""I can’t see this case being tried this year."" Sources said that if Willis is disqualified, it would likely take months for a new prosecutor to be appointed and get caught up on the case.
On the other hand, if Willis remains on the case, any appeal process — known under state law as a certificate of review — over her disqualification could take several months if the judge grants it.
If allowed to move forward with the certificate of review immediately, it’s ultimately up to the Georgia Court of Appeals to decide whether to hear the case.
While both sides wait for a decision, some sources revealed what their clients are thinking.
One said their client is ""sort of disgusted with the DA and all this stuff coming out.""
Another source makes clear that they make it a point to emphasize to their client the importance of not getting distracted by the motion to disqualify and instead to ""focus on the battle.""
One source told Fox News that if the judge doesn’t disqualify Willis, ""she’s gonna come back like a raging bull and she’s gonna be furious and she’s gonna want to exact a pound of flesh.""

"March 12, 2024 1:53pm EDT","7 child sex predators arrested in Florida undercover sting include TSA officer, retired Army member: sheriff",Fox News,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
An undercover child sex sting in Florida resulted in the arrests of seven suspects, including a Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officer and a retired Army staff sergeant, while an eighth suspect remains on the run, authorities said Tuesday.
The sting, ""Operation Child Protector V,"" was carried out over eight days in late February with detectives posing as children and adults who have access to children online, the Polk County Sheriff’s Office said. Detectives filed a total of 27 felony charges against the eight suspects.
Edmundo Dasilva, 37, was taken into custody after messaging an undercover detective that he would pay $60 to have sex with a child and showing up to the sting location, the sheriff’s office said. Dasilva told detectives he is married and works for Homeland Security as a TSA officer.
Another suspect, identified as 41-year-old Larry William Hayes, is a retired U.S. Army staff sergeant who worked as a satellite systems analyst and was working for the U.S. Department of Defense at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa with a high security clearance, Sheriff Grady Judd told reporters.

Hayes, who said he is married with three children, is accused of sending several explicit images of his genitalia to the undercover detective and agreeing to pay $250 for sex with a child.
After getting caught, Grady said he told detectives he was really there to save the girl.
""He immediately tells us, ‘I’m there to rescue her.’ Well, the reality is we rescued some child from him,"" Judd said.

"March 14, 2024 4:00am EDT",Relative of elderly California millionaire allegedly murdered by caregiver reveals how she became easy target,Fox News,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Violet ""Evelyn"" Alberts, a wealthy 96-year-old woman killed in a plot to steal her lavish California home, made herself an easy target by isolating herself with a ""mistrusting"" attitude and fear that those around her wanted her money, her former stepson told Fox News Digital.
When she was found dead in bed at her Montecito home in May 2022, ingredients to bake cookies in celebration of her upcoming birthday were found laid out on the table.
Porter Ranch resident and caregiver Pauline Macareno, 48, was charged with elder abuse, fraud and manipulation of legal documents in relation to Alberts' death, according to the Santa Barbara Sheriff's Department.
Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said at a press conference last Friday that she tricked Alberts by offering her a reverse mortgage and ""orchestrated a series of transactions, including forging documents and establishing fraudulent entities to gain control over Alberts’ assets unlawfully"" in 2022.
CALIFORNIA SUSPECTS ACCUSED OF MURDERING 96-YEAR-OLD WIDOW WHO WAS BAKING COOKIES FOR HER BIRTHDAY: POLICE

Macareno was sentenced to six years behind bars for the fraud, according to court records, and now faces charges of solicit to commit murder and conspiracy to commit murder. Brown said she was ""referred"" to Alberts for her care but did not specify by who or which agency.
Alleged accomplices Harry Basmadjian, 58, Ricardo MartinDelCampo, 41, and Henry Rostomyan, 33, face charges ranging from murder to conspiracy and solicitation of murder in the plot.
Attorneys for Macareno, MartinDelCampo and Rostomyan could not immediately be reached for comment. Basmadjian ""suffered a life-threatening medical emergency that left him totally incapacitated with a grim prognosis"" after his arrest, the sheriff said.
""In the eyes of Pauline Macareno, Miss Alberts was living too long,"" Brown said at a press conference last Thursday. ""And so the acceleration of her death is presumably what was … behind the murder.""
""Without any immediate family nearby, Violet relied on her friendships and connections within the neighborhood, through which she achieved a sense of belonging with a tight-knit community,"" Brown said.
Bruce Anderson, Alberts' former stepson from a previous marriage of hers, said he and his wife had no idea his former stepmother had been murdered until his California-based brother read about it in local newspapers.
VIRGINIA MAN ARRESTED AFTER DNA FORENSIC ADVANCEMENTS LINK HIM TO 2 COLD-CASE MURDERS

Anderson said Alberts, who went by her middle name, Evelyn, met his father, John Anderson, when he was the president of the California Rare Fruit Growers Society and she was a member.
The pair married in 1991. Although they divorced in 1996, they remained close friends until the elder Anderson died in 2005, paying frequent visits to each other's homes in Santa Barbara County.
Alberts' first husband died in the 1990s, Brown said last Thursday. When she died in 2022, Brown said, Alberts had aged out of her savings and was in a distressing financial situation.
PHOENIX SENIOR CHARGED IN KANSAS WITH 1982 COLD-CASE MURDER
But Alberts' hilltop property, within walking distance of Oprah Winfrey's home and Michael Jackson's compound, was her major point of pride, Anderson said.
The property was dotted with rare fruit and nut trees, he said, and Alberts had a prized Koi pond with fish imported from Japan, some worth thousands of dollars. She had a ""real interest in Japanese culture,"" and had a six-foot-deep Japanese soaking tub and Japanese design features throughout her nearly 5,000 square foot home.
Alberts owned her sizable property on Park Lane in Montecito, just a stone's throw away from Oprah Winfrey's home, since 1989. It was last appraised at just under $5 million. (Google Earth)
Assessment records show the home was last appraised at just under $5 million.
Alberts also kept a chicken coop on her property and was known for years in the Montecito community for selling eggs at local farmer's markets.
""Here's a lady that's got millions of dollars and she's selling eggs down at the farmers market just to talk to people. That's the kind of person she was – very outgoing and talkative,"" Anderson said.
But although she was known for her impeccable homemaking and hosting, Anderson said, she wasn't ""overly trusting.""
""She questioned a lot of things,"" Anderson said on Tuesday. ""Apparently she was [too trusting] in the end. … I don't think she was an easy mark, but she might have been later in life.""
Brown said at Thursday's press conference that Alberts was having difficulties with her ""memory and cognition.""

Since he had become estranged from her around 2005, Anderson said, his former stepmother ""might have been more inflicted with memory problems and dependent on other people.""
Anderson's wife, Darlene Anderson, said that ""vivacious"" Alberts ""always thought that someone was trying to get something over on her.""
It was ""painful"" when Alberts ""did not want to keep in contact"" because ""she always thought that the only reason we would be checking on her would be to try to get into her will,"" Darlene Anderson said.
""I never would have thought that us not doing something would have us not know that she was in that type of trouble,"" she said. ""She had enough money that we just thought she would be able to take care of herself … we forgot that when you are in your 90s, you don't always have the mental faculties to do that.""
Hearing of the heinous crime in the star-studded town where ""people knew each other, ran into each other in the grocery store [and] shared the same doctor"" was a shock, she said.
""In the eyes of Pauline Macareno, Miss Alberts was living too long.""
Darlene Anderson said that Alberts had a difficult financial start in life, and that ""every time her family contacted her, it wasn't to say, ‘Hey, I was just thinking about you today and I wanted to tell you that I love you.’""
""When they called, it was 'You have all this money and I don't have any and I need this, you need to send me $10,000.'… You get to the point where you don't want to pick up the phone,"" she said. ""I think that's something that's extremely sad. You definitely want to take a look at that and never want to be in that position in your life.""
The Andersons said that the role of family in Alberts' life was a ""major bone of contention"" in Alberts' relationship with her second husband that contributed to their divorce.
""She loved my father-in-law completely, [but] she was a little bit jealous of his family because she didn't have children of her own,"" Darlene Anderson recalled. ""She didn't understand the dynamics of a family.""
Another point of contention, they said, was that Alberts ""wanted to give her estate away to a cat shelter"" when she died.
""[My father-in-law was like, 'A cat is a cat and it's not supposed to have millions of dollars,'"" Anderson said.
Alberts lived in the Montecito neighborhood of Santa Barbara, California. (David McNew/AFP via Getty Images)
Regardless, Darlene Anderson said, it ""wasn't up to [Macareno] to decide whether Evelyn was going to will her money the way she wanted it.""
""[Macareno's] job was to take care of her … someone abused her, scared her, probably told her that if you didn't do this or do that, they would take away those contacts that she had,"" she continued. ""Can you imagine the fear that woman went through? It makes me extremely angry.""
Although this type of murder in affluent Montecito – an area with residents such as Meghan Markle and Prince Harry – is ""extremely rare,"" Pasadena-based criminal defense attorney Brian Claypool told Fox News Digital that ""serious crime in posh, affluent areas in California has been on the rise.""
""Last year, a lovely young lady working at an upscale furniture store in West Los Angeles was murdered in broad daylight,"" Claypool said. ""Serious smash-and-grabs happened in Beverly Hills before the holidays. Prosecutors are soft on crime in certain counties, like Los Angeles, which has emboldened criminals.""

A pretrial appeal filed with the Idaho Supreme Court by Bryan Kohberger’s public defenders was denied Tuesday, though reasoning behind the denial was not provided.
Kohberger’s attorneys claimed prosecutors indicted their client improperly on four counts of first-degree murder and a single count of burglary, to the grand jury.
Kohberger's defense argued that grand jurors find the higher legal standard of guilt ""beyond a reasonable doubt,"" instead of the widely accepted standard of ""probable cause"" in order to indict him. Judge John Judge told them they were wrong in an October hearing and put it in writing in December.
Kohberger's defense then appealed that to the Idaho Supreme Court, which rejected their request, and the matter was closed.

The suspect was attempting to delay proceedings by appealing one of the judge’s individual decisions to a higher court, which was denied. Specifically, Kohberger wanted the supreme court to overturn the judge’s decision not to toss the indictment.
Kohberger, a 29-year-old Pennsylvania criminology Ph.D. student, was attending Washington State University in the neighboring town of Pullman, across the state line, where prosecutors allege he entered an off-campus home around 4 a.m. on Nov. 13, 2022, and killed four University of Idaho students with a large knife in Moscow, Idaho.
Anne Taylor, Kohberger's lead defense attorney, asked the court in January to delay Kohberger’s trial until at least 2025, arguing she had not had enough time to complete discovery or interview more than a fraction of the witnesses. Latah District Judge John Judge held off on scheduling a trial date but denied Taylor's efforts to have the indictment against her client dismissed.

A Southern California district attorney is warning would-be criminals from neighboring counties to think twice before committing crimes in his jurisdiction via a public safety campaign.
The ad campaign by the Orange County District Attorney’s Office is in response to the rash of smash-and-grab robberies, home burglaries and other crimes that have garnered headlines. The office headed by District Attorney Todd Spitzer noted that many of the crimes are committed by offenders who live outside the county.
""Sacramento may be rolling out the red carpet for thieves, but here in Orange County we’re throwing the book at criminals who come here to steal,"" Spitzer said in a statement, referring to perceived soft-on-crime policies endorsed by legislators in the state capital. ""If you steal, we will prosecute. It’s that simple.""

The ads include billboards that read: ""Crime Doesn't Pay in Orange County. If you Steal, we Prosecute. The Orange County District Attorney's Office.""

"March 12, 2024 2:55pm EDT",Uvalde police chief resigns days after officers cleared of wrongdoing during tragic shooting: report,Fox News,"Former FBI special agent Nicole Parker reacts to the Justice Department's findings on police response to the Uvalde school shooting and migrants traveling without a photo ID on 'Fox News @ Night.'
The Uvalde, Texas, Police Chief Daniel Rodriguez, reportedly submitted his resignation to the city during a meeting Tuesday, which will be effective on April 6, according to reports.
The Uvalde Leader-News reported that Rodriguez nor city administrators specified why the chief was resigning, though the decision comes just days after the city released a report clearing officers of any wrongdoing in the tragic shooting that left 19 children and two teachers dead.
The shooting occurred at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde on May 24, 2022.
Reports said that hundreds of law enforcement officers waited 70 minutes on site, before a team breached the fourth grade classroom and confronted the 18-year-old gunman, who had been armed with an AR-15 style rifle and fired more than 140 rounds inside the school.

At the time of the shooting, Rodriguez was in Phoenix on a scheduled vacation.
Rodriguez said in his resignation letter that he was moving on to a new chapter in his career after leading the police department since 2018, when he was promoted to chief, the publication reported.
The chief did not immediately respond to inquiries from Fox News Digital about his resignation.

The city also told the station Assistant Chief of Police Homer Delgado will be named Interim Chief of Police until a full-time replacement can be appointed.
City officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.
Jesse Prado, an experienced investigator from the Austin, Texas area, conducted the Uvalde City Council report which investigated the Uvalde Police Department's response to the Robb Elementary School mass shooting in May 2022.
Prado determined that none of the initial five Uvalde police officers who responded to the shooting violated policy or committed serious acts of misconduct.

The five Uvalde police officers were identified as Sgt. Donald Page, who was one of the first officers to discover children in other classrooms in the hallway, on-site commander Peter Arredondo, Lt. Javier Martinez, Uvalde Detective Louis Landry and Staff Sgt. Eduardo Canales.
The review pointed to non-comprehensive law enforcement training, faulty communication and poor equipment as responsible for the fumbled response.

"March 13, 2024 4:00am EDT",Suspect in LSU student attack claims victim's romantic history 'crucial' to defense,Fox News,"Attorney for Madison Brooks' mother Kerry Miller reacts to defense lawyers claiming the defendants obtained verbal consent from Madison Brooks, telling 'The Story' it's a case of 'classic victim blaming.'
WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT
A lawyer representing one of Louisiana State University student Madison Brooks' alleged rapists claimed it's crucial to speak to a man Brooks supposedly had consensual sex with 24 hours before the attack.
Joe Long, who's representing Casen Carver in the ongoing rape case, filed the motion Monday to subpoena and interview the unnamed LSU male student and one of Brooks' female friends.
He said in the court filings that the information could help exonerate his client, according to a report by WAFB 9.
But the latest filing didn't sit well with Brooks' family's lawyer, Kerry Miller, and East Baton Rouge District Attorney Hillar Moore, who told the local news outlet that Long's motion ""is totally improper"" and vowed to fight it.
‘LAUGHING’ SUSPECT IN LSU STUDENT ATTACK INDICTED ON VIDEO RECORDING

Miller told Fox News Digital that Long's motion doesn't comply with Louisiana's rape shield law and continues the defense's trend of ""circumventing the law.""
""We're completely disgusted by this tactic,"" he said. ""You can't just file a public document like this. There's a policy to follow not to violate the rape shield law, which I think he did (violate), but that'll be decided by the court.""
Carver, 19, is one of four suspects charged in connection with Brooks' rape in January 2023. He was indicted on two separate occasions on charges of video voyeurism as well as first- and third-degree rape. He pleaded not guilty to all charges.
AS LSU REELS FROM MADISON BROOKS ALLEGED RAPE AND DEATH, CRIME TORMENTS COLLEGE TOWN
Carver was allegedly seen laughing in a self-recorded cellphone video and allegedly said, ""They finna (sic) rape her.""
He was referring to the three other suspects in his car, who met Brooks in Reggie's Bar in crime-ridden Tigerland, a social hot spot near the Baton Rouge university's main campus.
Brooks, who was 19, was in the back seat of the suspects' car when she was allegedly raped and let out on the side of a busy, four-lane highway, where she was fatally struck by an oncoming car.

Because Carver was indicted, he doesn't have a constitutional right to a preliminary examination, except for when there's a need to preserve evidence, WAFB reported.
Long argued that it should be allowed in this particular case because it's vital to get under-oath statements from the unnamed male student and Brooks' female friend.
He reportedly hasn't been able to reach the man, and the woman said she wouldn't testify, according to the local news outlet.

Carver's video, which hasn't been released to the public, is at the center of the court case against him and three other suspects: Everett Lee, 28; Kaivon Washington, 18, and Desmond Carter, a 17-year-old who is being charged as an adult.
Each suspect pleaded not guilty to all charges.

Miller was in the courtroom when the video was played. He told Fox News Digital in a previous interview that Carver's 10- to 15-second selfie videos provided law enforcement with eyes inside the car.
""You can see what's going on in the back seat from the right side of the camera,"" Miller said. ""That's where you see Kaivon pushing Maddie down.

""Then you see Carter with his pants down on top of Maddie. You kind of see her legs sticking up, and she doesn't have anything on. You know it's Desmond Carter because he wore a plaid shirt.""
As this alleged activity unfolded, Miller said, the music continued to play and at least one of the suspects was heard cheering.

The suspects did not seem to know that Brooks died until the next day, prosecutors alleged, according to Miller.
Brooks' mom, Ashley Baustert, told Fox News Digital in a previous interview that she spoke about Adams' and Devillier's bravery.
""It gives me a lot of comfort and peace in that Beau and Kathryn were both there. The last few people that Madi saw wasn't going to be her [alleged] attackers,"" Baustert said.

A California mom is accused of orchestrating a nationwide shoplifting scheme that stole millions of dollars' worth of makeup and clothing from hundreds of stores for more than a decade, according to the California Department of Justice.
According to a complaint filed by California Attorney General Rob Bonta, more than $300,000 worth of makeup and other products were found in Michelle Mack, 53, and Kenneth Mack's shared Bonsall home when a search warrant was served on Dec. 6, 2023.
Mack allegedly paid for airfares, hotels and car rental costs for up to a dozen women who would go out and steal goods before sending them to Mack's home. Mack would then allegedly sell the stolen goods at a discount on her Amazon Marketplace storefront.
Her group, which investigators have called the ""California Girls,"" operated in more than a dozen states around the country, targeting outlets including LensCrafters, Sephora and at least 231 Ulta stores, according to NBC San Diego.

Bonta said that while the current losses are calculated at nearly $8 million, the investigation is ongoing, and it's possible the total loss might end up exceeding that amount.
""If you try to make an easy buck off of other people's hard work, we will arrest you and prosecute you,"" Bonta said, as charges were filed. ""We are addressing an audacious instance of organized retail theft and making it clear that such criminal activity will not be accepted in California.""

Kathy Hochul for her crime policy after four people suspected of dismembering two different bodies around Long Island were able to walk free.
Asa Ellerup, the estranged wife of the architect turned suspected Gilgo Beach serial killer Rex Heuermann, revealed in a statement Wednesday night that she doesn't think her husband is ""capable"" of the allegations against him.
""I will listen to all of the evidence and withhold judgment until the end of trial,"" she said through her attorneys, Bob Macedonio and George Duncan. ""I have given him the benefit of the doubt, as we all deserve.""
Heuermann is facing counts of first- and second-degree murder in connection with the deaths of four women whose remains were found in the brush alongside Ocean Parkway, about 50 miles east of New York City. The victims were Melissa Barthelemy, 24; Megan Waterman, 22; Amber Costello, 27; and Maureen Brainard-Barnes, 25.

(Robert Miller for Fox News Digital)
""Ms. Ellerup visits Mr. Heuermann weekly and still maintains that Rex is not capable of the crimes he is accused of,"" her lawyers said in the statement.
Ellerup, who filed for divorce from Heuermann after his arrest in July, has begun visiting him regularly at the Suffolk County Jail.
A spokeswoman for the county sheriff said visitation logs show Ellerup first visited him in November, and she has stopped by a total of seven times. In her statement, she claimed to be going every week.
Her lawyer said she began visiting more frequently after her husband's indictment in Brainard-Barnes' death in January – months after prosecutors filed charges in the other three cases.

The divorce proceedings remain ongoing, Macedonio told Fox News Digital, and the couple had issues even before Heuermann's arrest. Prosecutors have alleged that Heuermann continued to patronize sex workers regularly up until his arrest, and women in the industry have described encounters with him in places as far apart as Atlantic City, Las Vegas and San Francisco.
Her lawyers said she wanted to send her ""heartfelt sympathies"" to the victims and their families.
""Nobody deserves to die in that manner,"" she said.

Now that she's overcome the initial shock of learning her husband has been accused of committing the community's most infamous cold case murders, however, she's decided to let due process unfold while remaining skeptical of the allegations, Macedonio added.
Heuermann is accused of killing a group of women known as the Gilgo Four, whose remains were all found in close proximity during the search for Shannan Gilbert, who went missing after a panicked 911 call in 2010. More than a decade later, Suffolk County police said they believed Gilbert's death had been an accident.

Alissa McCommon, a 38-year-old former elementary school teacher, was initially arrested Sept. 8 and charged with rape of a child.
""Our goal in any of these investigations is to identify any potential victims and provide medical assistance, counseling and support for their families throughout the investigation,"" Covington Police Chief Donna Turner said in a March 8 statement. ""Without this vital intervention, the ripple effect of trauma can last for years with the victims and the family unit.""
On March 5, a Tipton County grand jury handed down a 23-count indictment against McCommon ""with multiple sexual misconduct offenses against minors,"" the Covington Police Department said in a March 8 press release.

"March 12, 2024 1:28pm EDT",Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell asks court to overturn conviction,Fox News,"Documentary filmmaker Daphine Barak, speaks out on her interview with disgraced British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell on 'The Story with Martha MacCallum.'
Lawyers for Ghislaine Maxwell, the 62-year-old accomplice and former lover of the late sex-trafficking financier Jeffrey Epstein, will ask a federal appeals court to throw out her convictions Tuesday.
Maxwell was convicted in federal court in 2021 for her role procuring teen girls as victims for Epstein between 1994 and 2004 and later sentenced to 20 years in prison.
Her appeal is being heard in the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York. In a brief filed last year, her attorneys asked the court to review the statute of limitations, whether Maxwell's trial violated a prior non-prosecution agreement, an allegation of juror misconduct, and Maxwell's sentencing.
JEFFREY EPSTEIN VICTIMS SUE FBI FOR ALLEGED FAILURE TO INVESTIGATE ‘SEX TRAFFICKING RING FOR THE ELITE’

Epstein died in federal custody in 2019 while awaiting his own trial. He was 66. Both Maxwell and his brother, Mark Epstein, have publicly doubted the official finding that he hanged himself while alone in his cell.
Maxwell's lawyers have argued that after Epstein's death, she became a scapegoat due to outrage over his crimes and the lenient sentence he received in 2008 for a prior sex-trafficking conviction – 13 months with work-release.
Photo from 2001 that was included in court files shows Prince Andrew with his arm around the waist of 17-year-old Virginia Giuffre, who says Jeffrey Epstein paid her to have sex with the prince. Andrew denied the charges. In the background is Epstein's girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell. (U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals)
FLORIDA GOV RON DESANTIS SIGNS LAW WITH BIG POTENTIAL IMPACT ON EPSTEIN CASE
If her appeal fails, Maxwell isn't eligible for release until July 2037 on multiple counts of child sex trafficking. She is an inmate at Federal Correctional Institute Tallahassee, a low-security prison in Florida.
Separately, the Epstein saga has received much attention so far in 2024 – with the unsealing of hundreds of documents as part of a civil lawsuit between Maxwell and accuser Virginia Giuffre, a civil lawsuit by a dozen other accusers against the FBI, and a new law in Florida designed to make previously sealed filings in Epstein's criminal case public.
The unsealed documents cast renewed scrutiny on a number of figures in Epstein's inner circle, including the United Kingdom's Prince Andrew.

Epstein got a sweetheart plea deal on federal charges in 2008 in connection with that case and was only charged with more serious crimes in 2019 after a series of Miami Herald reports unveiled the lenient terms of his initial punishment.
The lenient deal also created the non-prosecution agreement cited in Maxwell's appeal, which protected potential co-conspirators.
Federal prosecutors in New York, however, counter that they are not bound by that deal, which Epstein struck with a former U.S. attorney in Florida. Separately, attorneys for at least one of Epstein's accusers have argued that the deal should be void because it violates the Crime Victims' Rights Act.
The new Florida law, taking effect on July 1, will allow grand jury testimony from cases involving dead suspects and crimes against children to be made public.
