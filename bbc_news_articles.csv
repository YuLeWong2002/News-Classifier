2024-03-13T05:15:58.000Z,Defamation case against Meghan Markle brought by half-sister dismissed in US,BBC News,"A US judge has dismissed a defamation case brought against the Duchess of Sussex by her half-sister.
Samantha Markle was suing Meghan over comments she made in a Netflix documentary and a 2021 interview with Oprah Winfrey.
In her ruling, Judge Charlene Edwards Honeywell found these comments were either opinions, substantially true, or did not plausibly defame Samantha.
The case was dismissed with prejudice, meaning she will not be able to refile.
Samantha had taken issue with Meghan's comment, made in her interview with Winfrey, that Samantha had changed her surname back to Markle when her half-sister had started dating the Duke of Sussex.
But in her ruling Judge Honeywell said: ""The court has taken notice of the fact that [Samantha] used the surname Rasmussen in September 2016 and Markle two months later, soon after [Meghan's] royal relationship was first reported.
""Therefore, the gist of the statement - that [Samantha] switched to her family name a short time after it was reported [Meghan] was involved with Prince Harry - is true.""
The lawsuit also took issue with Meghan's remarks on how close they were growing up, with Meghan telling Winfrey: ""I grew up as an only child, which everyone who grew up around me knows, and I wished I had siblings.""
Judge Honeywell ruled that this was Meghan's expressed opinion of the relationship.
The judge added that Samantha had failed to identify any statements that could support a defamation claim.
According to the court document, this was Samantha's third try at amending her complaint against Meghan, with whom she shares a father, Thomas Markle.
She first took legal action in March 2022, alleging the duchess had defamed her by giving information to an unauthorised biography called Finding Freedom and by discussing their relationship with Winfrey on live television.
The case was thrown out last year after Judge Honeywell found the duchess could not be liable for the contents of the book because she had not published it.

2024-03-11T13:54:11.000Z,Tuckerman Ravine: Skier dies after 600ft fall down Mount Washington,BBC News,"A 20-year-old has died after falling 600ft (183m) down a New Hampshire mountain ravine while skiing on Saturday, officials said.
Madison Saltsburg was evacuated after suffering ""fatal traumatic injuries"" during the fall on Mount Washington.
Two other people suffered non-life-threatening injuries.
At 6,288ft, it is the tallest peak in the north-eastern US and a popular yet difficult skiing destination.
The US Forest Service told US media that Mount Washington and surrounding areas have very steep ski mountaineering terrain and are ""subject to ever-changing mountain hazards"". ""These commonly include avalanches, open crevasse holes, icy steep slopes, and falling rocks and ice.""
The Tuckerman Ravine Trail - a south-eastern part of the mountain where Saltsburg fell - has ""highly exposed steep cliffs and slopes below it"", the forest service says on its website.
""The consequences of a fall or being involved in an avalanche can be dire,"" it warns.
The US Forest Service said that snow rangers and emergency personnel had been out helping people on the mountain on Saturday, including two others who were injured after falling down and hitting rocks and ice.
The agency said icy surfaces created dangerous conditions. Emergency personnel made the rescues during an evening of heavy snowfall and strong winds.
The BBC has contacted the US Forest Service for more details.
Just a day before, rangers had to rescue a 23-year-old skier from Kentucky who became hypothermic after he fell and hit his head while skiing the Ammonoosuc Ravine on Mount Washington.
""While descending into the ravine, [Joabe] Barbosa fell and hit his head and face, lost one of his sneakers, and eventually became hypothermic,"" New Hampshire Fish and Game officials said.
He was ""given boots, food, warm drink, proper winter gear, and a headlamp"", the agency said.

2024-03-08T14:51:53.000Z,"Who is Katie Britt, the Republican who gave State of the Union rebuttal?",BBC News,"Alabama's Katie Britt, the youngest woman representing the Republicans in the US Senate, has given her party's response to President Joe Biden's third State of the Union address.
Sitting at her kitchen table, she accused the president of being out of touch and painted a dark picture of the US under his watch.
""Right now, the American Dream has turned into a nightmare for so many families,"" she said.
The rebuttal - first delivered in 1966 - is often given by rising stars in the opposition party.
Ms Britt, 42, echoed popular Republican attack lines in her 17-minute speech, hitting Mr Biden hard on the border crisis and inflation.
Reactions to her performance were mixed. Conservative media outlet Fox News reviewed the speech as a successful effort which ""pulled-no-punches"" when ""shredding"" the president's national address.
But some criticism focussed on her performative delivery. Others took issue with the unconventional setting - her kitchen table in Montgomery - for a speech meant to counter presidential remarks delivered from the Capitol.
Alyssa Farah Griffin, a former Trump White House communications adviser, posted on X: ""I do not understand the decision to put her in a KITCHEN for one of the most important speeches she's ever given.""
Ahead of the speech, some political commentators had suggested Ms Britt was an astute choice to deliver the Republican response.
She has avoided isolationist tendencies in her party and emerged as a hawkish figure on national security. And her speech largely avoided the kind of combative politics championed by some in the party.
Now in her second year in the Senate, Ms Britt first arrived in Washington in 2004 as a congressional staffer. Having earned a law degree at the University of Alabama, she served variously as press secretary, communications director and chief of staff to Alabama Senator Richard Shelby.
In 2018, she was elected as the first woman to lead her state's business council, where she became associated with the Keep Alabama Open campaign during the Covid-19 pandemic. The role elevated her profile within the state, and her resignation in 2021 prompted speculation - proven correct - about her intention to seek the Senate seat of her outgoing mentor, Sen Shelly.
She was elected in 2022 after easily seeing off her main opponent for the Republican nomination, Mo Brooks - a state representative at the time and a long-time adversary of Mr Trump's - before sweeping away her Democratic rival in the general election.
Since her arrival in Washington DC, Ms Britt has taken a position on the powerful Senate appropriations committee and worked as a key fundraiser for more senior colleagues.
Among Democrats, she has won some approval by working on a bipartisan bill prohibiting children under 13 from using social media and visiting John Fetterman when the Pennsylvania senator checked into hospital to seek treatment for depression.
Thursday's speech has elevated her profile to the national stage and it won the approval of Donald Trump.
""She was compassionate and caring, especially concerning Women and Women's Issues. Her conversation on Migrant Crime was powerful and insightful. Great job Katie!"" he wrote on Truth Social, his own social media platform.
Some saw her speech as an audition for a spot on Mr Trump's list of candidates for the vice-presidency. But she and the former president are not natural allies.
She was the last member of Alabama's congressional delegation to endorse the 77-year-old in December, and observers note that her political views have been more temperate than Mr Trump's.
In an interview with Politico last year, Ms Britt criticised - obliquely - Mr Trump's penchant for personalised attacks on his political opponents.
""I really believe we have to get back to a place in this nation where you don't have to agree with someone 100% to show them respect and to be able to have a conversation and dialogue that you can learn from,"" she said.
Indeed, the Alabama native has been more closely aligned with outgoing Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell, joining his leadership group as an informal adviser last year.
Mr McConnell - a veteran dealmaker in the chamber - has long been at odds with Mr Trump and his brand of politics, although he endorsed the former president this week.
Ms Britt has also become known for her hawkish views on national security, at times running up against colleagues in a party increasingly defined by American isolationism.
Nonetheless, she has remained in favour with senior members of the Senate leadership and those within Mr Trump's orbit, a difficult feat.

2024-03-08T23:56:16.000Z,James Crumbley: Father of Michigan school gunman faces trial for son's mass shooting,BBC News,"Prosecutors have accused the father of the Michigan teenager who killed four students at his school of being negligent for ignoring his son's mental health and buying him a gun.
James Crumbley is charged with involuntary manslaughter over his son's mass shooting at Oxford High School.
Mr Crumbley did not know what his son was going to do, his attorneys argued during opening statements in the trial.
His wife, Jennifer Crumbley, was convicted of manslaughter last month.
Mr Crumbley, 47, has pleaded not guilty to four counts of involuntary manslaughter in the 30 November 2021 mass shooting.
During opening arguments on Thursday, attorneys for Mr Crumbley said he did not have a duty to protect other people from his son, nor did he know what Ethan was planning.
""You will not hear that James Crumbley knew what his son was going to do,"" defence attorney Mariell Lehman said. ""You will not hear that James Crumbley even suspected that his son was a danger.""
Officials also announced that Mr Crumbley's phone privileges from the jail would be curtailed after he was caught making threatening statements. They did not elaborate on what threats he had been making.
The case marks the first time parents have been charged with manslaughter over their child's role in a shooting.
Their son Ethan, 15 years old at the time, killed fellow students Tate Myre, 16; Hana St. Juliana, 14; Madisyn Baldwin, 17, and Justin Shilling, 17. He is serving a sentence of life in prison without parole.
Jennifer Crumbley, meanwhile, is facing up to 60 years in prison after a jury last month found her guilty on four counts of manslaughter for failing to stop her son from carrying out the deadly shooting. She will be sentenced next month.
During Mr Crumbley's trial on Thursday, prosecutors said Mr Crumbley had several opportunities to prevent the shooting, including getting his son help and taking him home from school.
The shooting ""didn't just happen out of the blue"", Oakland County prosecutor Marc Keast said. ""That nightmare was preventable, and it was foreseeable.""
Prosecutors called two witnesses to the stand, including a teacher injured in the shooting and Oxford police detective Edward Wagrowski.
Mr Wagrowski revealed that on the morning of the shooting, Mr Crumbley did not start his work as a DoorDash driver until 11:00 EST (16:00 GMT), despite telling school staff earlier in the day that he could not take his son home that morning because of work.
The parents had been called to the school because they found disturbing drawings from Ethan. After they would not take him home, school officials released him back to class with a gun in his backpack. He started shooting hours later.
In the hours after the meeting, Mr Crumbley drove past his home multiple times while doing deliveries, never once stopping to check that his son's gun was still there, prosecutors argued.
School officials had also asked the Crumbleys to get their son mental health treatment, but the police detective said Mr Crumbley had made no immediate effort to look into a list of counsellors the school suggested.
For the investigation, Mr Wagrowski reviewed text messages between James and Jennifer leading up to the shooting discussing their son's mental health.
In one text, Mr Crumbley wrote to his wife: ""Dude. Chill. He is fine. AND I am trying to [expletive] work.""
Prosecutors say the Crumbleys gifted Ethan a weapon just days before the shooting and did not properly store it. They showed jurors pictures of a lock for the weapon still in its packaging.
They also showed a text Ethan Crumbley had sent a friend a month before the shooting with a video of him holding a gun and saying: ""My dad left it out so I thought, 'Why not' lol.""
During the first week of the trial, jurors also heard emotional testimony from teacher Molly Darnell, who Ethan shot in the arm before she barricaded herself.
She said she saw blood going down her arm as she texted her husband: ""I love you. Active shooter"".
""He was aiming to kill me,"" she said.
Like his wife, Mr Crumbley could also face 60 years behind bars if convicted.

2024-03-12T13:54:01.000Z,Robert Hur defends focus on Biden memory in explosive classified files report,BBC News,"Special counsel Robert Hur will defend his explosive report into Joe Biden's handling of classified files under questioning from Congress.
He will tell lawmakers that his assessment of the president's memory as poor, remarks that sparked uproar last month, was ""accurate and fair"".
The report found Mr Biden ""wilfully"" retained troves of files but Mr Hur declined to charge him with a crime.
The president's age has become a key issue as he runs for a second term.
Last month, Mr Hur's report was published into how classified documents from Mr Biden's time as vice-president ended up in an office in Washington and in a garage next to his sports car in his home in Delaware.
Explaining why he declined to bring charges, Mr Hur said in his report that a jury would view him as a ""well meaning, elderly man"" with a ""poor memory"".
The comments enraged the White House and reinforced some voters' concerns over Mr Biden's age.
In prepared opening remarks shared hours before he appears before the House Judiciary Committee at Capitol Hill, Mr Hur defended his decision to detail issues with the president's memory, arguing it was relevant to his decision not to bring charges.
""My assessment in the report about the relevance of the president's memory was necessary and accurate and fair,"" Mr Hur plans to say. ""Most importantly, what I wrote is what I believe the evidence shows, and what I expect jurors would perceive and believe.""
He plans to add that he did not ""disparage the president"", but was required to explain his logic to the US attorney general. ""These are the types of issues prosecutors analyse every day,"" he will say.
Mr Hur alleged in his February report that the president struggled to recall major events from his time serving as vice-president, and could not remember when exactly his term in office had begun or when his son Beau died of cancer.
The transcript of the report - released just ahead of Mr Hur's testimony - shows Mr Biden did in fact remember the month and date Beau died, but struggled to remember the year.
""What month did Beau die? Oh God - May 30th,"" Mr Biden asked during the interview.
A White House lawyer responded with ""2015"" and the president responded: ""Was it 2015 he had died?""
The transcript painted a mixed picture of the president's two-day interview with the special counsel, during which Mr Biden frequently joked with the prosecutor and appeared to have good recall for large parts of the conversation.
But it also notes there was a great deal that Biden does not recall, including details about who packed boxes with his documents and how and when they were transported.
Mr Biden occasionally appeared to be reaching for words including the term ""fax machine"".
After Mr Hur's report last month, the president was quick to refute its claim that he was suffering from memory issues.
""I'm well-meaning, and I'm an elderly man, and I know what the hell I'm doing,"" he told reporters.
He responded angrily to Mr Hur's comments about forgetting the day his son died, saying ""How in the hell dare he raise that?""
The transcript released on Tuesday suggests the president was not asked directly when his son died.
The Republican Party has been stoking claims for months that the 81-year-old is not mentally fit to serve a second term in the White House, with polling suggesting that a significant proportion of voters are also worried about Mr Biden's mental acuity.
Republicans have also criticised Mr Hur's refusal to charge Mr Biden, comparing it with seven charges filed against former President Donald Trump in June. A trial is potentially scheduled for this summer.
Mr Hur argued there were ""several distinctions"" between the former president and Mr Biden's handling of classified documents, arguing the allegations against Mr Trump ""present serious aggravating facts"".
Mr Trump was given multiple chances to return classified documents but did the opposite, he wrote.
""According to the indictment, he not only refused to return the documents for many months, but he also obstructed justice by enlisting others to destroy evidence and then to lie about it.""

2024-03-08T21:59:22.000Z,Colorado DNA scandal threatens to overturn hundreds of criminal cases,BBC News,"Hundreds of criminal convictions may now be re-examined after investigators in Colorado found that one of their DNA analysts manipulated testing samples.
Yvonne ""Missy"" Woods is accused of manipulating data during her 29-year career for the Colorado Bureau of Investigation's (CBI) crime lab.
On Friday, the CBI said they had found 652 cases affected by her recent work. Some 3,000 samples require re-testing.
No charges have been filed against Ms Woods, who has retired from the CBI.
Officials are now examining all of her work, dating back to 1994. The CBI has set aside $7.5m (£5.8m) to conduct new tests, re-try cases and potentially reimburse inmates for wrongful convictions.
The statement issued by the CBI on Friday said that Ms Woods' tampering appeared to be ""intentional conduct"", adding that ""this discovery puts all of her work in question"".
Officials say she deleted, altered and omitted data in official criminal justice records. So far, they have identified problems in 652 cases she worked on between 2008 to 2023. Her work from 1994 to 2008 is still being reviewed.
""The review did not find that Woods falsified DNA matches or otherwise fabricated DNA profiles. She instead deviated from standard testing protocols and cut corners, calling into question the reliability of the testing she conducted,"" the statement says.
Her lawyer on Friday told the Denver Post that she is co-operating with the investigation and stands by her work, which he called the result of ""true and just criminal justice findings"".
""While the allegations resulting from the internal investigation point to Ms Woods deviating from standard protocols and cutting corners in her work, she has long maintained that she's never created or falsely reported any inculpatory DNA matches or exclusions, nor has she testified falsely in any hearing or trial resulting in a false conviction or unjust imprisonment,"" he said in a statement.
A criminal probe of Ms Woods activities is still underway.
""Public trust in our institutions is critical to the fulfilment of our mission,"" said CBI Director Chris Schaefer.
""Our actions in rectifying this unprecedented breach of trust will be thorough and transparent.""
The CBI is now performing an audit of all its DNA analysts, leading to the discovery of another scientist alleged to have manipulated data.
Chiara Wuensch was fired from the Weld County Sherriff's Office last week after the CBI discovered anomalies in her work. She is also now under a separate investigation.

2024-03-09T04:49:33.000Z,US lawmakers vote to avert government shutdown,BBC News,"US lawmakers have passed a government spending package shortly before a midnight deadline, averting a partial government shutdown.
The Senate passed six bills totalling $459bn (£357bn) which funds nearly 30% of the government.
It faced opposition, however, from some Republicans who argued the measure did not do enough to cut federal spending.
Republicans also wanted the bills to include stronger measures to address immigration at the southern border.
The set of compromise bills passed the Senate by a vote of 75-22 on Friday, following hours of last minute debate.
The bipartisan deal was struck by House and Senate negotiators last week, one day after congressional lawmakers travelled to the White House to meet President Joe Biden.
If a deal had not been reached, roughly 20% of government departments, including agencies that oversee agriculture, transportation and veterans affairs, would have to temporarily close by 12:01 (05:01 GMT) on Saturday.
Other federal funding, including defence spending and homeland security and state department budgets, would have expired a week later. Past shutdowns have led to furloughs of government workers and the closure of national parks.
Republicans control the House by a slim majority, while Democrats hold the Senate by a single seat. Spending bills to keep the US government open require buy-in from both parties in order to advance through both chambers to the president's desk for signature.
There have been 10 US government shutdowns or partial shutdowns over the past four decades.
A larger fight now looms ahead of a 22 March shutdown deadline.
Congress must now find a way to agree on a budget for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees immigration - a contentious political issue, especially in an election year.
The Pentagon's budget must also be decided before the deadline arrives in just two weeks.
""Today, we got the first half of the job done - passing a serious bipartisan package to fund key parts of our government,"" said Democratic Washington state Senator Patty Murray, the chairwoman of the Senate Appropriations Committee.
""This isn't the bill I would have written on my own, but this is a strong bipartisan package that sustains vital resources that matter in people's lives.""

2024-03-08T16:21:03.000Z,State of the Union: What the world made of Biden's big speech,BBC News,"Foreign policy figured highly in Joe Biden's annual address to Congress, which highlighted US involvement in conflicts around the world. So how was his speech received in those places?
It was notable that the president chose to begin his State of the Union by discussing Ukraine. He later went on to spend a few minutes on the Israel-Hamas war and finished by talking about ""standing up"" to China.
We asked three BBC correspondents to analyse his comments in each area.
By Sarah Rainsford, Eastern Europe correspondent
A year before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, President Biden agreed with an interviewer that Vladimir Putin was a ""killer"", enraging the Kremlin. Three years later, Mr Biden has now compared him to Adolf Hitler.
In his State of the Union address, he referred to Hitler being ""on the march"" in 1941 in Europe and then said that the Russian leader was ""on the march"" himself, warning that Russian aggression would not stop at Ukraine.
His message to President Putin, he said in his speech, was simple. ""We will not bow down.""
The Russian leader has claimed, falsely, that his invasion of Ukraine is aimed at ""de-Nazifying"" Russia's neighbour and he has elevated the Soviet Union's defeat of Hitler in World War II to near-cult status. So Moscow won't like this comparison at all.
But Mr Biden wasn't addressing Russia alone. He stressed the urgent need for the US to continue supporting Ukraine as it battles to defend itself and he called on Congress to unblock the bill that would release the funding Kyiv needs.
I've heard politicians and analysts in Ukraine describe losing US financial backing as ""catastrophic"". The delay is already damaging, forcing soldiers to ration ammunition on the frontlines.
As Moscow smarts at the comparison with Nazi Germany, Ukraine will welcome a State of the Union speech that opened with a rallying cry for democracy and support for Kyiv. President Biden said the US wouldn't ""walk away"".
Such words are important and appreciated. But similar calls have been uttered before and all the time Ukraine is losing more territory and more soldiers.
By Laura Bicker, China correspondent
It's hard to know which candidate China would prefer as it watches the discord on display in Washington during the State of the Union.
The contrast with its own rubber-stamp parliament, the National People's Congress, is stark. Nearly 3,000 delegates are meeting in Beijing this week in the Great Hall of the People where speeches are watched with quiet nods, a reverent hush and unwavering approval from the Communist Party elite.
There will be a level of unease from China's business sector that President Biden sees the need to show how tough he will be on Beijing. He said he wanted ""competition - not conflict"" with China, but business leaders may ask what form that competition will take.
He has already expanded sanctions against China on a range of issues, from human rights abuses to its relations with Russia. Relations are also strained over China's behaviour in disputed areas of the South China Sea, its military intimidation of Taiwan and growing technological competition.
Beijing will not see Mr Biden's competitor as a more promising prospect. While president, Donald Trump started a trade war with China and recently threatened to impose a 60% tariff on Chinese goods if he wins in November.
But Beijing might like the idea of another Trump presidency. The Biden administration has built an alliance to counter the might of China and he has been clear that the US would defend Taiwan if China tried to take the self-governing island by force.
In contrast, Mr Trump has refused to say he would help Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its own territory.
China can exploit these differences in Washington and use them to appear as a safer, long-term diplomatic bet for countries around the world as the two compete for global influence.
By Yolande Knell, Middle East correspondent
President Biden called events of the past five months ""gut-wrenching"" in his address.
While he blamed Hamas for starting the Gaza war, he stressed the high civilian death toll among Palestinians and had a sharp message for Israel about the need to allow basic supplies to reach the besieged territory, amid UN warnings of mass starvation.
Aid, he said, ""cannot be a secondary consideration or a bargaining chip. Protecting and saving innocent lives has to be a priority.""  This rebuke featured prominently in the Israeli media on Friday morning.
Driven by domestic politics in an election year - the need to show stronger American action - as well as deep humanitarian need, Mr Biden announced a plan for a new floating pier off Gaza to bring in food and basic supplies on ships via Cyprus.
In many ways, this ambitious idea - which the president was careful to say would not involve US military boots on the ground - is a measure of frustration with a key ally.
Israel officially welcomed the plan. It has stopped aid from entering via its own Mediterranean container port, Ashdod, 35km from northern Gaza, and also resisted opening more border crossings.

2024-03-09T01:26:40.000Z,The Oppenheimer story that won't win Oscars,BBC News,"The success of the film Oppenheimer has shone a spotlight on the work done by scientists in New Mexico as they developed the first nuclear bomb. But 80 years later, some local people say their story remains untold.
""Both my great grandfathers had cancer, my two grandmothers had cancer, my father had three different cancers, my sister has cancer,"" Tina Cordova says mournfully as she flicks through an old family photo album in her living room.
""I've lost count of the aunts and uncles and cousins who've had cancer. And my family is not unique.""
Ms Cordova lives in Albuquerque, about a two-hour drive from where the atomic bomb was developed.
She's one of the ""Downwinders,"" a term used to describe the communities who claim to have been affected by radiation from the Trinity Test, which was the world's first detonation of a nuclear weapon in the New Mexican desert.
The test is the centrepiece of Christopher Nolan's box office hit, Oppenheimer, which follows the physicist of the same name and his team of scientists and engineers who rushed to develop this bomb.
The movie, which is expected to win more awards at the Oscars this Sunday, examines the moral struggles of the men and women who changed the world with the work they did in the desert under a cloak of secrecy.
But Ms Cordova says the film reveals nothing of the legacy of the atomic bomb she says her family have been living with for generations.
The detonation is a memorable moment in the film, as scientists are handed dark glasses and gather on a breezy night to watch their theories and calculations become reality.
But carried on the wind, according to Ms Cordova, were unforeseen consequences.
""We firmly believe we have been over exposed to radiation during the Trinity bomb, and then also during the bombs that were detonated at Nevada,"" says Ms Cordova, who was diagnosed with thyroid cancer at the age of 39. Her 23-year-old niece has the same diagnosis.
Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States. While a link between radiation exposure from the Trinity Test and cancer has not been proven conclusively, Ms Cordova has documented hundreds of families with high rates of illness across multiple generations.
One of them is Paul Pino who says the penny dropped when he attended Ms Cordova's presentation about the radiation several years ago. ""It was a brutal realisation that came down on us like an avalanche,"" he recalls.
His family lived 35 miles from the Trinity Test location, and like Ms Cordova, several relatives have been wiped out from cancer. His brother died of stomach cancer and his mother of bone cancer. His sister has thyroid cancer, his daughter had skin cancer and two of his aunts had brain tumours.
The US government has established compensation funds for people in areas where tests happened in later years but New Mexico has not yet been included. That could now change.
An extension to the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act Expansion that would include the Downwinders of New Mexico is set to expire in June. This week the Senate passed the bill in a bipartisan vote. It now goes to the House of Representatives, and the Biden administration has previously indicated support for the passage of the bill.
When the atomic bomb was used on Japan, it effectively ended World War II. The death toll weighs heavily on Oppenheimer's conscience in the movie but the potential risks to people closer to home is a storyline that was not explored.
""They [the filmmakers] never gave any acknowledgement to the sacrifice or suffering of the people of New Mexico,"" says Ms Cordova regretfully.
Elsewhere in the state, the film is viewed less negatively, particularly in Los Alamos, the secret city where Oppenheimer's team of scientists carried out their work.
​​For residents there, it's not the history the film lays bare that's being talked about but its impact on the economy.
""Our little town has been turned upside down,"" says Todd Nickols whose parents were scientists. ""We are inundated with a lot more visitors:""
The location of Los Alamos is dramatic, beautiful and remote. The red rock plateaus meet big blue skies for as far as the eye can see. It's a place for the country's best brains to free their imaginations and make scientific breakthroughs, away from prying eyes and distractions.
""My father was a nuclear physicist, and my mother was a geneticist,"" says Mr Nickols. ""And this was just a great wonderful place to grow up. We are proud of the science, proud of the technology.""
The name of Oppenheimer is inescapable in the town. There's Oppenheimer Drive, Oppenheimer's statue and several Oppenheimer murals. Many of the local residents of Los Alamos were also extras in the movie.
""We are certainly not glorifying the bomb deaths by any means because it was a horrible, horrible situation,"" says Mr Nickols. ""But World War Two was also horrible.""
Today, scientists at Los Alamos still play a key role in making the components for nuclear warheads. As the US government updates its weapons, the lab has been ramping up production.
If you were to stop a random person in the street and address them as ""Dr"" you probably wouldn't be far wrong. Los Alamos residents have the highest number of PhDs per capita in the country.
""My grandfather worked at the lab, my mother worked at the lab, in fact I'm the first person in my family in three generations to not work at the lab,"" says Gerald Burns, who is pulling pints in a bar which serves a beer called Hoppenheimer.
The film has clearly been good for business - the bar sells T-shirts with images of Oppenheimer on them with the tag-line ""no science, no beer"". But what about the moral aspect behind what all this symbolises?
""We have a very nuanced and balanced view of that,"" he says. ""We do have to have respect and regard for when things go wrong, or when things are used as a weapon.""
Others take a different view. Back in Albuquerque a small group of anti-war campaigners have gathered to hold a weekend protest about the continuing work in Los Alamos. ""Say no to nukes!"" say the placards. ""Ban the bomb."" Their leaflets decry the US using the lab there to renew a nuclear arms race.
As the Oscars ceremony looms, Ms Cordova hopes the buzz around the film will shine a light on the health risks she says are clear and real.
Without the people of New Mexico, there would have been no research project and no Oppenheimer movie, she says.
""I say shame on them. They had an opportunity to actually do something really amazing.""

2024-03-11T15:26:17.000Z,US man sentenced for murder of tourist by Germany's Neuschwanstein Castle,BBC News,"A US man has been sentenced to life in prison for the rape and murder of a fellow American tourist and the attempted murder of her friend near one of Germany's top visitor attractions.
A German court convicted Troy Philipp B, 31, for the attack on the two tourists near Neuschwanstein Castle.
Last month, he admitted attacking one of the women before pushing her and her friend off a ravine on 14 June 2023.
He had befriended the two women before luring them off the public path.
In Monday's sentencing in district court in the town of Kempten, Bavaria, Judge Christoph Schwiebacher noted the ""particular severity of guilt"" in the case.
He indicated the killer would probably not be eligible for parole after 15 years, which is typical for people who receive life sentences in Germany, according to Agence France-Presse news agency.
German officials did not identify the victims, but relatives named them as University of Illinois graduates Eva Liu, 21, and Kelsey Chang, 22.
The Michigan man lured the two friends away from the Marienbruecke bridge, a popular viewpoint for the fairytale castle.
He led them to a hidden trail, telling them that the way to the bridge was difficult to navigate.
Authorities say he then shoved Ms Liu to the ground, raping and strangling her before Ms Chang tried to stop him.
He pushed Ms Chang into the 50m deep (164ft) ravine and continued assaulting her friend, strangling her with a belt and recording it.
He then pushed an unconscious Ms Liu into the same ravine after some hikers came across the scene.
Mountain rescuers were able to the find the women, and they were airlifted on helicopters. Ms Liu died from her injuries in hospital.
Ms Chang had severe injuries, but survived.
The suspect was not detained until later that day after a massive manhunt.
A tourist who witnessed his arrest said his ""face was covered in deep red scratch marks and his neck as well"", adding ""there was clearly a struggle"".
At trial in February, the defendant said he was ""deeply ashamed"" of his actions, which he claimed were not premeditated. He also admitted possessing child pornography.
In an obituary, relatives described Ms Liu as ""a bright and inquisitive student with many passions, including baking, travelling, and music"".
The German court did not release the killer's full name, citing privacy laws.
Located 78 miles (126 km) from Munich, Neuschwanstein Castle in Bavaria draws over 1.3 million tourists each year.

2024-03-13T00:36:21.000Z,White House to send new $300m weapons package to Ukraine,BBC News,"The US will send $300m (£234m) in military weapons to Ukraine, including ammunition, rockets and anti-aircraft missiles, the White House has said.
The surprise announcement comes as a bill in Congress to send further aid to Ukraine stalls amid partisan debate.
The US shipment, the first in nearly three months, is intended to prevent Ukraine from losing ground to Russia.
National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said this aid ""is nowhere near enough to meet Ukraine's battlefield needs"".
""This ammunition will keep Ukraine's guns firing for a period, but only a short period,"" Mr Sullivan told reporters on Tuesday, adding that ""it will not prevent Ukraine from running out of ammunition.""
The White House has been appealing to Congress for months to pass a budget that sends aid to Ukraine, as well as Israel and Taiwan.
A $60bn aid bill has already passed the Senate, but has yet to face a vote in the House of Representatives.
Speaker of the House Mike Johnson has so far refused to consider the Senate bill. Mr Johnson, an ally of Donald Trump, has said the House will vote on its own aid bill, but only after Congress passes a budget that overhauls the US immigration system.
On Tuesday, a group of bipartisan lawmakers in the House launched a longshot petition - an attempt to force the House to vote on the Senate bill - using a rare procedural tactic that hasn't been successfully employed since 2015.
Tuesday's emergency package of weapons and equipment comes from cost savings made in earlier Ukraine weapon contracts.
The aid announcement came as President Joe Biden hosted Poland's president and prime minister at the White House in a show of support for Ukraine.
Following the meeting, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk told reporters that he hopes Mr Johnson ""is already aware that, on his individual decision, depends the fate of millions of people"".
""This is not some political skirmish that only matters here in America,"" he said.
""The absence of this positive decision of Mr Johnson will really cost thousands of lives [in Ukraine]. Children. Women. He must be aware of his personal responsibility.""
Also on Tuesday, Denmark announced that it would ship around $336m in ammo and artillery to Ukraine.
Ukraine has lost ground in recent months due an ""artificial shortage"" of weapons, the country's president, Volodymr Zelensky, said last month.

2024-03-08T17:18:10.000Z,Three escaped inmates charged with death of US couple,BBC News,"Three escaped inmates from the Caribbean island of Grenada have been charged with the murder of a US couple who went missing in late February.
Police said the suspects hijacked a catamaran owned by Virginia couple Ralph Henry and Kathy Brandel while they were aboard.
The couple is believed to have been thrown overboard.
The suspects then sailed away to the island of St Vincent, police said, where they were arrested.
Ron Mitchell, 30, Atiba Stanislaus, 25, and Trevon Robertson, 23, were each charged with capital murder, escaping lawful custody, housebreaking, robbery and kidnapping by authorities in Grenada.
Mr Stanislaus is also facing rape charges, though police did not specify who he is accused of raping.
Police said the trio escaped prison on 18 February before hijacking the US couple's catamaran and sailing 80 miles (128 kilometres) to St Vincent, where they were arrested on 21 February.
Grenada police commissioner Don McKenzie said at a news conference last week that the suspects allegedly committed ""several criminal acts including bodily harm to the couple"".
The suspects appeared in court on Thursday and will be held in prison until their hearing in late March.
The Salty Dawg Sailing Association, of which the American couple were long-time members, said the couple's boat, named Simplicity, was found anchored and abandoned off a beach on the south coast of St Vincent.
They said the boat displayed signs of ""apparent violence"", and that the couple was not aboard.
Police did not say whether their bodies have been recovered, but the couple's family said Mr Henry and Ms Brandel are presumed to be dead.
The sailing association said that the couple were spending the winter cruising the Eastern Caribbean. They had spent 10 years living on their boat after selling their home in Alexandria, Virginia, close to Washington DC.
In a statement, the couple's sons, Nick Buro and Bryan Hendry, said that the couple ""lived a life that most of us can only dream of, sailing the eastern coast of the United States, living on their home Simplicity, making friends with everyone they encountered"".
The sons had previously said in interviews that blood was found on the boat and the couple's possessions were strewn about.
""While the end of their life may have been dark, they brought light, and that light will never be extinguished from the hearts and minds of the people who knew, loved and cared so deeply about them,"" the family added.

2024-03-08T22:21:40.000Z,Details emerge on victims in Canada mass killing,BBC News,"A Sri Lankan father who survived the mass murder of his family in Canada said he returned home from work on Wednesday to find his wife and four young children had been killed.
Dhanushka Wickramasinghe, 34, was also attacked but managed to subdue the suspect.
He is now recovering in hospital from a slash to the eye and one of his hands.
A 19-year-old Sri Lankan student who was living with the family was charged with the deaths.
The new details of the night the Wickramasinghe family was killed emerged from a series of media interviews with Bhante Suneetha, the resident monk at a local Buddhist monastery in Ottawa that the family attended.
Mr Suneetha, who visited the father in hospital on Thursday, said he is in ""great shock"" over what happened.
Police in Ottawa discovered the slain family at their townhouse in the Barrhaven suburb after responding to emergency calls placed at around 22:52 local time (03:52 GMT) on Wednesday.
Chief Eric Stubbs with the Ottawa Police Service said the calls came after a man, later determined to be Mr Wickramasinghe, yelled for neighbours to call for help.
Responding officers then found the bodies of Mr Wickramasinghe's wife, 35-year-old Darshani Dilanthika Ekanayake, and their four young children: seven-year-old Inuka Wickramasinghe, four-year-old Ashwini Wickramasinghe, three-year-old Ranaya Wickramasinghe, and two-month-old Kelly Wickramasinghe.
Police also found the body of 40-year-old Amarakoonmudiayansela Ge Gamini Amarakoon, an acquaintance who was living with the family.
The Wickramasinghe family were newcomers to Canada. Naradha Kodituwakku, the former president of the Sri Lanka Canada Association in Ottawa, told reporters that they had arrived last year.
In an interview with CBC, Mr Suneetha described them as kind people who often lent a helping hand at the local temple.
""They are innocent and also very helpful people. It doesn't matter [who would ask] for help from them,"" he said.
Febrio De-Zoysa, an international student from Sri Lanka, was arrested at the home without incident and has been charged in connection to the murders, which police said were carried out using a ""knife-like object"".
Algonquin College in Ottawa released a statement to the media on Thursday confirming that Mr De-Zoysa was enrolled at their college, and that his last semester of attendance was winter 2023.
In a statement published on Facebook, the General Consulate of Sri Lanka in Toronto expressed its condolences to the family and friends of the victims.
It also alerted parents of those who are studying abroad from Sri Lanka ""to pay more attention to their children during their transition and integration"" into a foreign country like Canada.
Police did not specify a motive for the crime, saying the family were ""innocent victims"", and that their investigation is ongoing.
Mr De-Zoysa made his first court appearance in Ottawa on Thursday, where he was formally charged with six counts of first-degree murder and one count of attempted murder.
A vigil will be held for the family on Saturday, and a GoFundMe launched for Mr Wickramasinghe by the Buddhist Congress of Canada has raised more than C$53,000 ($39,300; £30,500) as of Friday afternoon.

2024-03-10T02:42:05.000Z,Biden and Trump rally in Georgia as 2024 rematch looms,BBC News,"Donald Trump and Joe Biden have both held campaign rallies in the US state of Georgia, as their general election showdown comes into greater focus.
The former president, 77, slammed Thursday's State of the Union speech as an ""angry, dark and hate-filled rant"".
An hour later, President Biden, 81, unveiled new endorsements as he went on the offence against his rival.
Both men are now within striking distance of clinching their respective party nominations for president.
Mr Trump has so far amassed 1,076 delegates and is 139 away from the number needed to lock in the Republican nod. Mr Biden has collected 1,859 delegates, 109 short of what he needs to secure the Democratic ticket.
Each man has the chance to complete the task in primary contests on Tuesday, including in Georgia.
Their shadow-boxing duel on Saturday also comes two days after Mr Biden rebuked his predecessor's rhetoric and record in harsh terms during his State of the Union address to Congress.
Speaking in the north-western city of Rome, Mr Trump hammered his ""grossly incompetent"" opponent for ""the most divisive, partisan and radical speech ever delivered by a president in that chamber"".
""Joe Biden should not be shouting angrily at America,"" he argued.
""America should be shouting angrily at Joe Biden.""
He also zeroed in on border security and the murder last month of Laken Riley, a Georgia college student allegedly killed by an undocumented immigrant.
Immigration is now the top concern for US voters, according to a Gallup poll released last month.
With supporters holding aloft photos of Ms Riley, and her family and friends in attendance, the former president vowed to ""demand justice for Laken"" and ""seal the border"".
He also slammed Mr Biden for rowing back on comments during the State of the Union in which he referred to the suspect as ""an illegal"". The president expressed regret in an MSNBC interview that he had not used Democrats' preferred term - undocumented.
Mr Biden's controversial remark came during an exchange with top Trump ally Marjorie Taylor Greene, who rallied with Mr Trump on Saturday in Rome, the city she lives in and represents in Congress.
Speaking about an hour's drive away in the capital city of Atlanta, Mr Biden told supporters: ""It can tell you a lot about a person, who he keeps company with.""
He attacked Mr Trump - who also hosted Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban at his Florida home on Friday - for ""sucking up to wannabe dictators and authoritarian thugs all over the world"".
Reframing November's general election as ""a contest between competing forces in a battle for the soul of this nation"", the president reiterated his view that Mr Trump's ""story of resentment, revenge and retribution"" was not in the best interests of voters.
Fresh off the buzz of a State of the Union watched on television by more than 32 million Americans, Mr Biden's campaign for re-election is on the offensive.
He visited the battleground state of Pennsylvania on Friday, and will rally in Michigan and Wisconsin next week, while members of his administration are also fanning out across the country.
In coming weeks, ""we will dramatically expand our volunteer engagement, scale up our battleground staff, launch our coalition groups, and invest in new paid media campaigns"", campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said.
One such ad - that will target voters in seven swing states over the next six weeks - was launched earlier on Saturday and directly addresses concerns about his age.
""Look, I'm not a young guy, that's no secret,"" it begins, before making the case that the veteran politician's experience has helped him ""understand how to get things done for the American people"".
During his Saturday appearance in Atlanta, Mr Biden's crowd was small but enthusiastic, holding up signs passed around by organisers with the phrase ""we're on board"".
At the event, the campaign formally unveiled an endorsement from a trio of political action groups, who will spend $30m (£23.3m) to mobilise black, Latino and Asian voters in support of the Democrat.
The president hit on many of the points from his punchy address on Capitol Hill, delivering remarks with energy that seems to have suffused his new style.
Keeping up that pace over the next eight months will be challenging, but it comes as no surprise his latest tit-for-tat with Mr Trump came in Georgia.
Based on the results of their 2020 race, the southern state is the most marginal one in the country. Mr Biden won here by fewer than 12,000 votes.
A big part of his victory came from almost nine out of ten black voters supporting him, but recent polls have provided worrying signs, with a distinct lack of enthusiasm among many black voters for Mr Biden's candidacy.
Polls show Mr Trump in the lead here, but he too has problems. Georgia is home to one of the four criminal cases against him that could go to trial before the election, and he faces 13 felony charges over his alleged efforts to overturn his 2020 loss in the state.
In short, Georgia is on both these men's minds and victory in November may well hinge on its result.

2024-03-11T20:29:59.000Z,Family of five killed in apparent Hawaii murder-suicide,BBC News,"Authorities in Hawaii are investigating the apparent murder-suicide of a family of five, including three children in a Honolulu home.
The father, who has not been identified, is believed to have stabbed to death his wife and three children - aged 10, 12 and 17 - before taking his own life, police said.
Witnesses reported an argument at the home on early Sunday morning.
The deaths mark Hawaii's worst mass killing in over two decades.
Police initially responded to a call at 08:30 local time (18:30GMT) but left when no one answered the door, authorities said at a press conference on Sunday.
After receiving a second call less than an hour later, officers entered the home and found four people fatally stabbed.
The husband also was found dead and the cause of death remains under investigation, police said.
Police are still investigating a motive.
Honolulu's police chief Joe Logan said that the crime scene would have an impact on the responding officers ""as it would on any officer, for the rest of their lives"".
Nearby residents told local media that the family had lived in the area for about a decade. The children would often be seen playing outside.
""They are like a typical festival family. They dress up the house for the holidays and it's all normal,"" neighbourhood man Hiro Izumo told Hawaii News Now.
In a statement, Honolulu Mayor Rick Blangiardi said that the ""inexplicable"" tragedy had ""shaken our community"".
""Our heartfelt thoughts and prayers go out to the families and friends grappling with this profound loss,"" he said. ""Let us stand together in support and solidarity during this difficult time.""
Police said the killings represented one of the deadliest crimes in the state since the so-called ""Xerox murders"" of 1999, in which a suspect fatally shot dead seven co-workers.

2024-03-12T01:48:42.000Z,Rescued dogs at heart of DC animal cruelty probe get fresh start,BBC News,"More than two dozen dogs were rescued from a US home last month after a 13-hour standoff between their owner and police serving an animal cruelty warrant. Some have now found new homes.
The tense 14 February incident was splashed all over local media in the nation's capital and even mentioned by the White House.
The suspect, accused of breeding and mistreating his pets, had barricaded himself into his southeast Washington DC home and fired on the officers trying to arrest him, injuring three in the process.
Once he was finally taken into custody, a Humane Rescue Alliance team found 31 canines - 20 adults and 11 puppies - inside the home, with bite wounds and other injuries.
According to court documents, the dogs were ""living in their own waste"", with neighbours ""complaining of the [odour] of urine and [faeces] coming from the house"".
HRA officials - who investigated the abuse allegations - removed the animals from their unsanitary living conditions and placed them in a shelter.
The dogs, all American Bullies or ""some mix thereof"", ranged from two months to several years old, according to the organisation. On Saturday, HRA thrilled local dog lovers with a huge adoption drive.
When Kevin Peterson saw the dogs on TV as part of HRA's campaign one night earlier, he turned to his wife and said: ""I'm going! I'm going to be there when it opens.""
He kept rewinding the segment so he could get a better look at every dog and puppy featured in it, and then he saw her - a brown Bully puppy no more than 10 weeks old.
She reminded him of his last dog, a Blue Bully named Peyton who he had raised from eight weeks and who had lived to 15 years.
Mr Peterson was not sure he ever wanted to replace Peyton. ""I loved my blue,"" he told the BBC. ""I didn't want to get another colour.""
He went down to the adoption centre three hours earlier than the event began, so that he could be the one with ""first dibs"".
And, while other prospective owners sat around in the parking lot waiting for their turn, he got out of his car and went inside, to ask questions and say which dog he was there for. The centre let him into the pen so he could interact with the animals.
""She really came right up to me,"" Mr Peterson claims of the pooch he adopted. ""They asked me, which one do you want? I said I want the one that wants me.""
He named her Coco Cinnamon Peterson, a name his grand-daughter has already put on a plaque to show the dog she is family.
Mr Peterson has not received her official adoption papers yet to confirm it but believes that she is of mixed breed.
The American Bully breed is banned in the UK, a move that he does not understand because he says, while Peyton was protective of her owner and home, she ""never ever bothered anybody"" in her lifetime.
""Dogs are how you make them or how they see what you do,"" Mr Peterson said, before conceding ""I don't know what it is.""
Then he added: ""But a German Shepherd will bite you just as hard as a pit bull.""
Tired from playing with her new owner's young relatives, Coco was snoring on his lap as Mr Peterson spoke to the BBC.
""I don't want this dog to think - when she sees the pictures of [Peyton] - that I just picked her because she looks like my other dog,"" he said.
""We had a life with her, we loved her and she loved us, and she went to heaven,"" he added. ""Now I've got another dog and she don't love us [but] we're going to love her.""
Six of the 31 rescues have been adopted by their HRA caretakers. By the end of Saturday's adoption drive, 14 dogs - including Coco - had been adopted.
The remaining dogs are receiving training and behavioural support to prepare them for new homes, the organisation said.

2024-03-08T19:32:48.000Z,Trump ally Michael Whatley and daughter-in-law Lara Trump take over at RNC,BBC News,"Donald Trump has cemented his take-over of the Republican Party with the ascent of two loyalists to the top leadership positions in its national organisation.
The former president earlier endorsed Michael Whatley and Lara Trump, his daughter-in-law, for chair and co-chair of the Republican National Committee.
Their elections were formalised on Friday at the RNC's spring training gathering in Houston, Texas.
Mr Trump, 77, is slated to soon become the party's presidential nominee again.
Ahead of what will be his third consecutive election to the Republican nomination, allies and supporters had piled pressure on him to remove long-time RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel.
Ms McDaniel was chosen by Mr Trump in 2017 and, in January 2023, won election to a record fourth term that was due to last until 2025, but offered in February to step aside.
She has long faced complaints that the RNC was not aggressive enough in backing up the ex-president's debunked claims that the 2020 election was rigged against him. Mr Trump, whose final weeks in the White House were pre-occupied by a frantic and sprawling effort to ""stop the steal"", has reportedly said that not enough resources were poured into finding lawyers, filing lawsuits, training poll-watchers and investing in election-integrity efforts.
The latter portion of Ms McDaniel's tenure has also overseen an anaemic period of fundraising on behalf of Republicans, with the party coffers last year taking their worst beating in a decade and entering 2024 with about half as much cash on hand as Democrats.
That has been to the detriment of the former president, whose legal bills have been soaring for months as he faces 91 felony charges across four upcoming criminal trials, the first of which begins later this month.
Mr Trump is also currently on the hook for roughly half a billion dollars as a result of civil trial rulings against him in his home state of New York over sexual assault, defamation and business fraud. On Friday, he posted a nearly $92m (£72m) bond in the defamation case he lost to writer E Jean Carroll.
In recent months, Mr Trump has also lashed out at the RNC for hosting a series of debates ahead of the primary election. Though he easily qualified to attend every event, the Republican frontrunner declined to participate each time, arguing that he was so far ahead in the polls that he did not need to face challengers who were far behind him.
The five RNC-sanctioned debates provided a platform to rivals like Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and former UN ambassador Nikki Haley to criticise Mr Trump, largely unrebutted, between August and January. Though their efforts did not significantly narrow Mr Trump's polling advantage, they helped extend the primary season and force him to keep spending campaign cash.
In his new hand-picked recruits, Mr Trump has found both an ally committed to backing his election fraud claims and a family member apparently devoted to supporting him with party funds.
""President Trump deserves to have the team that he wants in place at the RNC,"" Ms McDaniel said in emotional farewell remarks.
Her second-in-command, RNC co-chair Drew McKissick, also stepped aside on Friday.
Mr Whatley, who takes over Ms McDaniel's role, is the current chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party and a former party general counsel. He is said to have boasted to Mr Trump about his actions to protect election integrity in his state.
Mrs Trump, the wife of Eric Trump, is expected to play a major role in fundraising and media appearances as the new co-chair. She has previously said the RNC must ""spend every single penny"" to re-elect Mr Trump, including by supporting his legal costs.
In their acceptance speeches, they promised to work ""hand in glove"" with the presumptive nominee, with Mrs Trump flashing a $100,000 cheque she had just been donated to the committee.
""If a dollar that we have is not directed towards winning this November, that dollar will not be spent,"" Mr Whatley said.
The former president is also planning to install two of his senior campaign advisers, Chris LaCivita and James Blair, to senior positions at the RNC.
Remaking the party in his image comes as Mr Trump needs the full weight of its infrastructure behind him in a general election rematch with President Joe Biden that is forecast to become the most expensive election in US history.
Polls show the two men locked in a statistical dead heat eight months out, but the Democrat has been on a record fundraising blitz since the start of the year and has roughly twice the cash reserves of his opponent.

2024-03-08T19:44:41.000Z,Ex-president of Honduras found guilty of drug crimes,BBC News,"Juan Orlando Hernández, the ex-president of Honduras, has been found guilty of drug trafficking charges in a federal US court.
Hernández was convicted on Friday of conspiring to import cocaine into the US, and possessing ""destructive devices"" including machine guns.
Prosecutors said the ex-president ran Honduras like a ""narco-state"", protecting and accepting bribes from drug traffickers.
Hernández now faces life in prison.
The 55-year-old former president had denied any wrongdoing and pleaded not guilty in the case.
He was convicted by a jury in a Manhattan federal court after about two days of deliberations.
Hernández was president of Honduras from 2014 to 2022, serving for two consecutive terms.
He initially ran as a law-and-order candidate who promised to address the issue of drug-related crime in the country.
Instead, prosecutors accused him of partnering with ""some of the world's most prolific narcotics traffickers to build a corrupt and brutally violent empire based on the illegal trafficking of tonnes of cocaine to the United States"".
Three months after leaving office, he was extradited to New York and arrested in April 2022 to face federal charges in the US.
Hernández was once seen as a strong US ally. During his leadership of Honduras, the country received more than $50m (£39m) in anti-narcotics assistance from the US, as well as additional millions of dollars in security and military aid.
In 2019, then-President Donald Trump thanked Hernández for ""working with the United States very closely"".
Hernández in turn thanked Mr Trump and the American people ""for the support they have given us in the firm fight against drug trafficking"".
Prosecutors later uncovered that Hernández was linked with drug traffickers as far back as 2004, long before he became president, and that he had facilitated the smuggling of around 500 tonnes of cocaine to the US.
They said drug traffickers paid him millions of dollars in bribes to allow cocaine to be smuggled from Colombia and Venezuela through Honduras on to the US.
In one allegation, prosecutors said that Mexican drug lord Joaquín ""El Chapo"" Guzmán had given Tony Hernández - the ex-president's younger brother - $1m (£778,450) as a bribe for Juan Orlando Hernández.
During his trial, several convicted drug traffickers testified that they had bribed Hernández.
Prosecutors also alleged that he had used the drug money to then bribe officials to manipulate Honduras' 2013 and 2017 presidential elections in his favour.
In his denial of the allegations, Hernández claimed that he became a ""victim of a vendetta and a conspiracy by organised crime and political enemies"".
""I had a policy against all those people because I could not stand them,"" Hernández said of drug traffickers when testifying at his own trial. ""They did a lot of damage in the country.""
His lawyers argued that those who testified against him were doing so for their own gain.
Hernández has been held at a Brooklyn jail since his extradition.
He will be sentenced at a later date.
Hernández is not the first ex-Latin American head of state to be convicted of a drug-related crime in the US.
Panama's Manuel Noriega was convicted on drug trafficking charges in a Miami court in 1992, and Guatemala's Alfonso Portillo was convicted on money laundering charges in a New York court in 2014.

2024-03-12T16:05:56.000Z,Biden and Netanyahu's deepening rift on public display,BBC News,"In the days after the 7 October attack, two US aircraft carrier strike groups set sail for the Middle East - a war-ready fleet signalling President Biden's determination to deter Israel's foes.
On Tuesday, a different projection of American power departs from the east coast.
More than 1,000 US troops will set sail to build a vast, floating harbour to supply Gaza with food and stem the growing risk of Palestinians dying of starvation.
The contrasting missions, within five months of war waged between Israel and Hamas, have revealed the strain contained in Washington's policies.
One current and two former administration officials told the BBC they believe the US approach amounts to an outright contradiction: Arming Israel while at the same time unsuccessfully urging it to allow far more aid through its military lines to reach the war's civilian victims.
The United States remains Israel's closest ally and biggest provider of military aid, yet an already troubled relationship between Mr Biden and Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has atrophied into a clash increasingly on public display. At its core is the spiralling number of civilians killed and a humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where the UN warns that more than half a million people - a quarter of the population - is on the brink of famine.
Mr Biden has become more and more vocal in calling for Israel to let much more humanitarian aid into the territory, with ""no excuses"". He used his State of the Union speech to argue for Israel's fundamental right to defend itself since the Hamas attacks but also to tell its leadership that life-saving supplies to Palestinians could not be a ""bargaining chip"". He has called Israel's response in Gaza ""over the top"".
The Israeli prime minister insists aid is being allowed in, laying blame instead with Hamas for ""stealing"" it and the UN for failures in its distribution. The UN in turn blames Israel for attacking police who secured the convoys.
Mr Netanyahu hit back at the US president over his criticisms and over a warning he was ""hurting"" more than ""helping"" Israel, telling Mr Biden he was wrong on both counts.
""The attempt to say that my policies are my private policies that are not supported by most Israelis, is false. The vast majority are united as never before and they understand what's good for Israel,"" Mr Netanyahu told the Politico website on Sunday.
Israel is the world's biggest cumulative recipient of US military aid, supplied by Washington with around $3.8bn worth of weapons and defence systems each year.
Mr Biden, caught on a ""hot-mic"" after his speech to Congress, said he had told Mr Netanyahu he would have a ""come-to-Jesus meeting"" with him, sparking speculation he could make a threat to cancel some weapons supply as leverage. Mr Biden later suggested an Israeli assault on the city of Rafah, where some 1.5 million mostly displaced Palestinians have sought refuge, was a ""red line"".
But he also appeared to back-track, saying: ""The defence of Israel is critical… There's no red line [in which] I'm going to cut off all weapons so they don't have the Iron Dome [missile defence system].""
Mr Netanyahu responded during his interview on Sunday, vowing to press ahead into Rafah: ""We'll go there. We're not going to leave [Hamas]. You know, I have a red line. You know what the red line is? That October 7 doesn't happen again. Never happens again.""
Among critics of US policy are some who have spent decades implementing it.
Josh Paul, a former senior official at the State Department who resigned last year in protest over the impact of military assistance to Israel, said the administration should abide by US laws that limit arms supplies if a country is deemed to be restricting access to US humanitarian aid.
""Using the US Air Force, or building this pier [to deliver aid]… both of those are being done because the administration has not leaned on Israel hard enough to open the ground lines of assistance to Gaza.""
""I think American military families need to be very aware that the president is making a decision to put their family members into harm's way, rather than leaning on an ally to follow its own obligations under international law,"" said Mr Paul.
Pressed by the BBC on Monday over the extent of its influence, the US State Department said it was the ""intervention of the United States that has led humanitarian assistance to go into Gaza in the first place.""
""The President of the United States travelled to Israel and cemented a deal that Secretary Blinken initially reached to allow [the] Rafah [crossing with Egypt] to open,"" said State Department spokesman Matthew Miller.
Israel's government denies blocking access, saying ""Israel has placed no restrictions on the amount of food, water, medical or shelter equipment that can enter the Gaza Strip,"" blaming a ""backlog"" on UN agencies which the UN categorically rejects.
Dave Harden, a former mission director at the US Agency for International Development (USAID) in the West Bank and Gaza, told the BBC that Mr Netanyahu didn't appear to be listening.
""He almost treats Biden as some kind of inconsequential second secretary of a low-ranked European power… the gap between Israel and the US just deepens,"" said Mr Harden.

When posting the bond, Mr Trump asked to pause the verdict while he fights to reverse the decision in a separate court.
""Due to the numerous prejudicial errors made at the lower level, we are highly confident that the Second Circuit will overturn this egregious judgment,"" the former president's lawyer, Alina Habba, said in a statement.
A different jury last year found Mr Trump sexually assaulted Ms Carroll, a former Elle Magazine columnist, in a Manhattan Bergdorf Goodman store in the 1990s. The jury found Mr Trump liable of defamation for lying about the assault in 2019, and in January he was ordered to pay her $83.3m.
The bond payment is equal to 110% of the amount he was required to provide in order to appeal against the verdict.
Mr Trump was also ordered to pay Ms Carroll $5m in a separate defamation case related to the sexual assault last year. He put up the money shortly after.
Judge Lewis Kaplan made the verdict official in February and gave Mr Trump 30 days to post a bond or put up the cash.
In this year's trial, the jury found Mr Trump liable of defamation for lying about the assault in 2019, and in January he was ordered to pay her $83.3m, much of it in punitive damages.
On Thursday, Judge Kaplan said Mr Trump waited too long - 25 days - before seeking to delay the payment.
""Mr Trump's current situation is a result of his own dilatory actions,"" he wrote.
Ms Carroll's lawyers opposed the request, writing to Judge Kaplan that Mr Trump ""asks the Court to 'trust me' and offers, in a case with an $83.3 million judgment against him, the court filing equivalent of a paper napkin; signed by the least trustworthy of borrowers"".
A spokesperson for the former president said the decision was ""a continuation of a totally lawless witch hunt,"" a frequent comment from Mr Trump's team throughout his numerous legal trials.
But the 77-year-old is facing mounting legal bills and damages this year.
In February, Judge Arthur Engoron ordered Mr Trump to pay $355m - which amounts to more than $450m with interest - for fraudulently inflating his assets to secure better loan deals.
An appellate judge rejected Mr Trump's request to post a bond for just a fraction of the penalty in that case.
The likely Republican presidential nominee claimed this week that he was not worried about securing the funds in his legal cases.
""I have a lot of money. I can do what I want to do,"" he told Fox News on Tuesday.

2024-03-08T21:42:01.000Z,Did State of the Union change how voters see Biden?,BBC News,"President Joe Biden gave a vigorous State of the Union address on Thursday, working to counter a narrative haunting his re-election bid - that he's too old for the job.
US political pundits and analysts called his roughly 60-minute speech ""fiery"" and ""forceful"".
Mr Biden, 81, is the oldest president to hold office, and opinion polls often show his age is on the minds of American voters.
We asked members of our US voter panel, many of who had supported Biden but expressed concerns about his age, if his speech had affected how they see him.
A 21-year-old economics student at Morehouse College, an historically black university, Aylon voted for the first time in the last election.
I have concerns about his age. He's about the age of my grandmother, and I know how my grandmother is.
But I think we saw a fiery speech from him yesterday, and it made me more confident. He showed us that he can still be quick on his feet. He delivered some blows back to Republican hecklers that were excellent.
I'll definitely be voting for Joe Biden, even though he has issues and problems with age.
Biden followed through on delivering a black woman to the Supreme Court. He has fought against losing protections with the overturning of Roe v Wade. He's done his best to cancel student loan debt.
Darlene, 65, voted for Donald Trump in 2020 and hasn't been persuaded to vote differently this time around.
""Fiery"" is a polite word to say that he was rambling. He just seemed to be mad, and he came off as a grumpy old man.
To me, the expectations and the bar were set too low. It was like, ""let's just hope he gets through this and not stumble off the stage"". He was more coherent than I've heard him in the past.
And so the question is, do I think he can handle four more years? I don't think so. It's a shame that we don't have an age limit.
If I have to choose between him and Donald Trump, I'll choose Trump, the lesser of two evils. I don't feel like President Biden or the Democratic party have done enough for black people. They expect to automatically receive our vote. They have to earn it.
Amy, 42, has voted both Democrat and Republican in her lifetime.
I think it's the best speech President Biden has ever given in his entire career. Before yesterday, I did have doubts. But I do not question his aptitude after last night's speech.
Him pounding on the podium, him speaking more sternly and yelling - that's all the stuff that Trump does that the American population responds to. He's presenting differently, and I think it's resonating.
I am an ageist, right or wrong. And I do think both candidates are too old.
I voted for Biden in 2020 and will vote for anyone but Trump in November. Overturning Roe v Wade was it for me.
Michelle, 60, voted Democrat in the last presidential election. She's not thrilled by either candidate's age, but will vote for Biden again.
The State of the Union address felt like more of a campaign speech, designed to promote his mental acuity.
He diplomatically chided his predecessor for his language and actions that have deepened the political divisions in this country.
As much as I like Biden, I believe he is too old to continue to lead the country. But if Trump wins he will be as old during his term.
This country needs younger people to lead.
Karen, 48, voted for Joe Biden in 2020. She was worried about how he would perform at the podium.
I had concerns that Joe Biden would not be able to combat the pervasive perceptions that too often follow the elderly, things like they serve no use to society.
I thought he might stutter and lose his train of thought. But he showed energy and experience.
His State of the Union speech boiled down the choice Americans will face in November and drew clear distinctions between a party and man who wants good things for this country and a former president who holds a starkly different, largely unfavourable view.
I don't need to love my president, but I do need not to feel ashamed of who they are.

2024-03-13T07:15:39.000Z,How the US military plans to construct a pier and get food into Gaza,BBC News,"A US plan to deliver aid to Gaza from a floating pier at sea will be fraught with potential logistical and security challenges.
More than 1,000 US troops are expected to participate in the operation although the Pentagon says there will be no ""boots on the ground"".
To help achieve that, the US has partnered with a little-known private firm, Fogbow, which is run by former military and intelligence officials.
The goal is to deliver aid equivalent to two million meals a day to Gaza, where the United Nations has warned that famine is ""almost inevitable"" without urgent action.
Here's what we know about this huge logistical exercise.
US Army vessels set sail on Saturday and Monday to take equipment to the Mediterranean. According to the Pentagon, the plan includes two main components which need to be assembled - a big floating dock made up of steel segments and a two-lane, 1,800ft (548m) causeway and pier.
The causeway will be composed of interconnected, 40ft (12m) steel pieces linked together and attached to the shore.
Cargo ships deliver supplies to the dock and the aid is then offloaded onto a range of barges and smaller vessels - known as logistics support vessels, or LSVs - and taken to the pier.
From there, vehicles will drive the supplies onto land and into Gaza.
The causeway will be assembled at sea and ""driven"" into the beach, allowing US forces to avoid setting foot on Gaza. The US is supporting its ally Israel and has designated Hamas a terrorist organisation.
This amphibious building project - officially known as Joint Logistics Over-the-Shore, or JLOTS - is one that the US military has used before in Kuwait, Somalia, Haiti and Central America for disaster relief missions.
Earlier versions were used as far back as World War II following the invasion of Normandy on D-Day. As recently as July last year, the defence department used similar JLOTS equipment during a large-scale exercise in Australia.
""The military's preference, of course, is to have an operating port. That makes everything much easier,"" Mark Cancian, a retired US Marine Corps colonel with experience planning amphibious operations, told the BBC.
""But that's not always possible, either due to a conflict situation or in a peacetime, humanitarian mission,"" he added. ""That's where JLOTS comes in.""
Fogbow is led by Sam Mundy, a former Marine Corps lieutenant colonel who previously commanded forces in the Middle East, and Mick Mulroy, a former CIA paramilitary officer and assistant secretary of defence for the Middle East.
The full details of what they will be doing has not been made public before. But a person familiar with the plan told the BBC that the Fogbow operation - known internally as Blue Beach Plan - is primarily to organise the movement of aid after it arrives on the Gaza shore.
The containers will be emptied and the contents put on trucks to be taken to distribution points further into Gaza, as part of a plan approved by the US and Israeli governments.
The BBC has been told that Fogbow is still looking for funding and has briefed a range of European and Middle East governments on the plans. In the longer term, Fogbow plans to set up a donor-run foundation to help funnel aid into Gaza.
Military experts say the plan's success is dependent on security, both from the possibility of hostile fire in a still-active combat zone and from large crowds of civilians gathering on the shore.
Retired Rear Admiral Mark Montgomery, a 32-year veteran of the US Navy with experience delivering humanitarian aid, said that the operation requires a ""security cocoon"" to be established both on the beach and in the shallow water nearby.
""You cannot have civilians getting on the pier,"" said Mr Montgomery. ""They could be a parent desperately looking for food for their children - or they could be trying to kill somebody. That would shut down operations.""
Two people familiar with the plan told the BBC that the Israel Defense Force (IDF) will run ""outer"" security to prevent crowds of civilians reaching the beach and to make the area safe. The distribution will be the responsibility of local, unarmed Palestinians.
Fogbow is expected to have only limited logistics roles and will not be involved in distribution.
While the Pentagon has said no US troops will set foot in Gaza, experts say the reality could be more complicated.
""People are going to have to be giving guidance on the exact angles you want things to go in, or perhaps the right consistency of sand that is needed, those sorts of things,"" Mr Montgomery said.
""They will need to be there checking things out and making sure we're anchoring in the exact right spot.""
If that person on the beach is not a US service member, it will be an experienced contractor, probably retired US military, Mr Montgomery added.
According to the US defence department, this temporary pier will mean two million meals a day could enter Gaza.
That would be enough to feed almost all of the territory's 2.3 million population. It would also constitute far more aid than is currently coming in over land through the Rafah border crossing with Egypt and Kerem Shalom crossing with Israel, or through airdrops.
Earlier this week, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said the maritime option was being explored because other options are insufficient. But he said there is no substitute for assistance coming in trucks over land, so they would continue to push for that.
The quickest and most effective way to get aid into Gaza is by road. But aid agencies say Israeli restrictions mean a fraction of what is needed is crossing.
Humanitarian organisations and US officials have said that increased shipments over land remain the only viable option to meet demand while the pier is set up.
""Even in a best-case scenario, [the pier] won't be there for close to two months as an effective delivery mechanism,"" Mr Montgomery said. ""We have to account for that as we handle humanitarian challenges over the next 45 days.""
The operation could be partly functioning before the pier is built. The BBC understands that Fogbow is looking into dredging a beach to allow barges to get close enough to shore that aid can be unloaded on to trucks.
Others are also exploring the maritime route for aid while so little is getting in over land.
A Spanish ship towing a barge loaded with 200 tonnes of food supplies has finally set sail from Cyprus on Monday. It hopes to dock at a small jetty being built by a US charity on the Gaza coast.

2024-03-08T15:05:47.000Z,State of the Union: Biden draws election battle lines in fiery speech,BBC News,"President Joe Biden delivered a fiery State of the Union address on Thursday, taking repeated swipes at Donald Trump and covering the broad themes of his re-election campaign.
Mr Biden used the term ""my predecessor"" to refer to Mr Trump 13 times in a speech that lasted more than an hour.
He accused his likely election opponent of ""bowing down"" to Russia and criticised him over the Capitol riot.
Mr Biden also covered immigration, abortion, the economy and Gaza.
The atmosphere in the House chamber was raucous at times, with loud cheering from Democrats and heckling from some Republicans.
It was a spectacle more typical of a political convention than a State of the Union address - a constitutionally mandated report that is usually heavy on pageantry and policy.
But this is an election year and the stakes for Mr Biden were high. He was feisty and confrontational as he sought to draw the battle lines for his nascent campaign.
Unsurprisingly, many of his barbs were aimed at Mr Trump given he is almost certain to be his opponent in November's general election.
""My predecessor failed the most basic duty any president owes the American people - the duty to care,"" he said in reference to Mr Trump's handling of the Covid pandemic. ""That is unforgivable.""
He criticised Mr Trump for his recent comments about Russia and Nato, and said that he sought to ""bury the truth"" about the 6 January 2021 attack on the US Capitol.
He blamed him for the Supreme Court decision to overturn the Roe v Wade ruling which guaranteed abortion rights and for blocking bipartisan immigration reforms.
Mr Trump, meanwhile, had promised to react in real time to the speech on his Truth Social platform. ""Biden is on the run from his record and lying like crazy to try to escape accountability for the horrific devastation he and his party have created,"" he wrote.
""They continue the very policies that are causing this horror show to go,"" he said.
Mr Biden's aggressive approach on Thursday may have been born, at least in part, out of necessity. At 81, he is the oldest president in US history and has been beset by questions about his age and mental acuity.
His approval ratings are the lowest of any modern president seeking re-election. He is in a statistical dead heat with Mr Trump, however, who also is viewed negatively by voters.
Even when Mr Biden addressed his age, he did so with a jab at Mr Trump, who at 77 is only a few years younger than him.
""I know it may not look like it, but I've been around for a while,"" he said. After rattling off a list of positive attributes he said defined America, he added a kicker.
""Some other people my age see a different story: an American story of resentment, revenge and retribution.""
Mr Biden regularly ad-libbed responses to what was at times a hostile audience on the Republican side of the chamber. He quipped, parried and expressed mock surprise at their outbursts.
When the topic turned to immigration, a subject of political vulnerability for the president, he was once again ready to engage. But here, he stumbled.
After Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene accused him of ignoring the murder of Georgia nursing student Laken Riley, allegedly by an undocumented Venezuelan immigrant, Mr Biden held up a button with her name on it - one Ms Greene had given him as he walked in.
After seemingly mispronouncing her name as ""Lincoln"" Riley, he said she was murdered by an ""illegal"" - a term criticised by immigrant-rights groups.
Mr Biden went on to call for Republicans to support the bipartisan immigration legislation passed by the Senate and accused Mr Trump of ""playing politics"" by opposing the bill for electoral gain.
The damage, however, may have been done, as the president's use of the word ""illegal"" prompted push back from the progressive wing of his party.
Delia Ramirez, Democratic congresswoman from Illinois wrote on X that she was ""disappointed"" in Mr Biden for using ""dehumanizing right-wing rhetoric to speak about immigrants"".
And Democratic Congressman Joaquin Castro of Texas told the Texas Tribune that Biden was using ""dangerous rhetoric"".
""And I think that the president is getting bad advice from his advisers and speech writers,"" Mr Castro said.
When Mr Biden wasn't throwing haymakers at his opponent, he sought to highlight what he characterised as a record of accomplishment during his first term and outline a sales pitch for his re-election.
""I inherited an economy that was on the brink,"" he said, ""and now our economy is the envy of the world.""
Figures on the American economy have been trending up for months now. The public perception of the economy, however, has been much darker.
Mr Biden nodded at this split, calling the US economic revival ""the greatest story never told"".
Whether the president's words will be enough to change minds, however, remains to be seen.
It was a speech geared toward the American middle class - the voters of moderate means who make up the bulk of the electorate.
It included a variety of new proposals, most of which would require congressional legislation to enact - an unlikely scenario unless Democrats retake the House of Representatives in November.
He pitched a tax credit for new home buyers, who have seen their purchasing power eroded by higher mortgage rates. He also called for expanding a cap on prescription drug spending to every American who has health insurance and raising taxes on corporations.
Mr Biden opened his speech with a call for military aid to Ukraine, but the bulk of his discussion of foreign policy came towards the end when he turned his attention to the Middle East.
The Gaza war has divided Democrats, with a vocal portion of the president's liberal flank calling for the US to use every means at its disposal to push for a ceasefire. Some took to the Washington streets on Thursday evening in an unsuccessful attempt to block the president's motorcade from reaching the Capitol.
Mr Biden said his administration was working towards a ceasefire that would last ""at least 6 weeks,"" and he detailed a new plan - announced earlier in the day - for the US to construct a temporary seaport in Gaza to allow humanitarian aid to enter by ship.
He had some harsh words for Israel, calling the civilian casualties in Gaza ""heartbreaking"" and saying it had a ""fundamental responsibility"" to protect innocent lives.
Mr Biden's speech, because it was delivered without any significant stumbles or gaffes, is a hurdle cleared for the president - and its content could serve as a guide to how his campaign plans to sell the American public on another four years of Democratic governance.
At the very least, it will probably convince nervous Democrats that their presumptive nominee is ready to go toe-to-toe with his Republican opponent in November.

2024-03-10T22:53:58.000Z,Katie Britt denies misleading voters in Biden State of the Union rebuttal,BBC News,"Republican Katie Britt has defended her use of an account from a sex trafficking victim to attack President Joe Biden's State of the Union address.
In a televised response, she used the story to attack his border policies, despite the case taking place in Mexico years before Mr Biden took office.
Fact-checkers pointed out inaccuracies in the Alabama senator's comparison.
But in a Fox News interview on Sunday, Ms Britt insisted she had not misled voters with her claims.
In her response to the president's speech, the Republican invoked the story of a woman who was raped thousands of times in a sex trafficking operation run by drug cartels, starting from when she was 12 years old. Her communications director told The Washington Post that the anecdote was about Karla Jacinto Romero.
Ms Romero has spoken publicly about her abuse in the past, but said it happened in her home country of Mexico from 2004 to 2008 - when Republican George W Bush was US president.
""We wouldn't be OK with this happening in a third-world country. This is the United States of America, and it's past time we start acting like it,"" Ms Britt said in the Thursday night speech televised from her kitchen.
Asked by Fox News Sunday host Shannon Bream if she meant to ""give the impression that this horrible story happened on President Biden's watch"", the senator replied ""no"".
Ms Britt, the youngest woman representing the Republicans in the Senate, instead insisted that she was speaking about actions Mr Biden has allegedly taken to weaken border security.
She went on to say that ""human trafficking has gone up under President Biden"".
""It's disgusting to try to silence... the story of what it is like to be sex-trafficked,"" she added. ""This is a story of what is happening now at an astronomical rate, and we have to bring attention to it.""
Sen Britt has faced broader criticism for her State of the Union response, which is traditionally delivered by rising stars within the opposition party.
Some Republicans took issue with the unconventional setting - her kitchen table in Montgomery - for a speech meant to counter presidential remarks delivered from the Capitol.
Alyssa Farah Griffin, a former Trump White House communications adviser, posted on X: ""I do not understand the decision to put her in a KITCHEN for one of the most important speeches she's ever given.""
Other Republicans criticised her ""overcoached"" delivery, which Hollywood actress Scarlett Johansson skewered in a scathing skit on Saturday Night Live, a program popular with young viewers.
Referencing the sex-trafficking story, Ms Johansson said: ""Rest assured, every detail about it is real, except the year, where it took place and who was president when it happened.""
After the rebuttal speech on Thursday evening, Republican president frontrunner Donald Trump praised Ms Britt, writing on social media: ""Her conversation on Migrant Crime was powerful and insightful. Great job Katie!""

2024-03-13T10:56:44.000Z,US election 2024: A really simple guide,BBC News,"Americans will head to the polls in November 2024 to elect the next US president. The person sitting in the White House's Oval Office has a big influence on people's lives both at home and abroad, so the outcome of this election matters for everyone.
The US political system today is dominated by just two parties, so every president in modern times has belonged to one of them.
The Democrats are the liberal political party, with an agenda defined largely by its push for civil rights, a broad social safety net and measures to address climate change.
It is the party of incumbent President Joe Biden, who is trying to secure a second term in power.
The Republicans are the conservative political party in the US. Also known as the GOP, or the Grand Old Party, it has stood for lower taxes, shrinking the size of the government, gun rights and tighter restrictions on immigration and abortion.
Former President Donald Trump is the last Republican left in the race and has secured enough support to be nominated the Republican candidate.
The nominations will be made official at party conventions this summer.
The 2024 election will be on Tuesday, 5 November 2024. The winner will serve a term of four years in the White House starting in January 2025.
The 2024 presidential campaign is well under way. It started with 15 candidates - nine Republicans, four Democrats and two independents - although nearly all have already dropped out of the race.
The two main parties nominate a presidential candidate by holding a series of state primaries and caucuses.
There are differences between the parties and the process varies from one state to another.
One of the biggest polling days is known as Super Tuesday - named because more than a dozen states all held their primary contests on Tuesday 5 March.
President Biden announced his re-election bid earlier this year and has won enough support to secure the Democratic Party nomination despite some long-shot challenges.
In the Republican Party, former President Donald Trump saw off his last remaining challenger, former UN ambassador Nikki Haley, and has won enough primary contests to propel him over the finish line to be nominated the Republican candidate.
There are also some independent candidates running for president, including Robert F Kennedy Jr, nephew to former president John F Kennedy.
Both candidates compete to win electoral college votes.
Each state has a certain number of electoral college votes partly based on its population and there are a total of 538 up for grabs, so the winner is the candidate that wins 270 or more.
This means voters decide state-level contests rather than the national one, which is why it's possible for a candidate to win the most votes nationally - like Hillary Clinton did in 2016 - but still be defeated by the electoral college.
All but two states have a winner-takes-all rule, so whichever candidate wins the highest number of votes is awarded all of the state's electoral college votes.
Most states lean heavily towards one party or the other, so the focus is usually on a dozen or so states where either of them could win. These are known as the battleground states.
All of the attention will be on who wins the presidency, but voters will also be choosing new members of Congress - the government's legislature - when they fill in their ballots.
All 435 seats in the House of Representatives are up for election, while 33 Senate seats are also up for grabs.
Republicans control the House and Democrats are in charge of the Senate.
These two chambers pass legislation so can act as a check on White House plans if the controlling party in either chamber disagrees with the president.
If you're a US citizen and you're 18 or over, you should be eligible to vote in the presidential election, which takes place every four years.
Usually a winner is declared on the night of the election, but in 2020 it took a few days to count all the votes.
The period after the election is know as the transition if there is a change of president.
It's a time for the new administration, including cabinet ministers, to form and make plans for the new term.
The president is officially sworn into office in January in a ceremony known as the inauguration, held on the steps of the Capitol building in Washington DC.

2024-03-13T00:57:25.000Z,"John Barnett: Boeing whistleblower 'hoped to change its culture', family says",BBC News,"Lawyers for the Boeing employee-turned-whistleblower found dead by apparent suicide have hailed him as ""a brave, honest man of the highest integrity"".
Authorities are currently investigating the death of John Barnett, from what appeared to be a self-inflicted wound.
Mr Barnett retired after working more than 30 years at Boeing in 2017. He was giving evidence in a lawsuit against the company before his death.
Two of his attorneys called on police to fully investigate how he had died.
""John was in the midst of a deposition in his whistleblower retaliation case, which finally was nearing the end,"" Robert Turkewitz and Brian Knowles said in a statement to the BBC.
""He was in very good spirits and really looking forward to putting this phase of his life behind him and moving on. We didn't see any indication he would take his own life. No one can believe it.""
Calling on officials in Charleston, South Carolina to provide more information about what happened, they wrote: ""No detail can be left unturned.""
Mr Turkewitz and Mr Knowles added that Mr Barnett was somebody who ""cared dearly"" about his family, his friends and Boeing, from its pilots to its customers.
From 2010 until his retirement on health grounds, Mr Barnett worked as a quality manager at the North Charleston plant making the 787 Dreamliner, a state-of-the-art airliner used mainly on long-haul routes.
In that job, he ""learned of and exposed very serious safety problems with the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and was retaliated against and subjected to a hostile work environment"", his lawyers said.
After retiring, he embarked on a long-running legal action against the company.
He accused it of denigrating his character and hampering his career because of the issues he pointed out - charges rejected by Boeing.
At the time of his death, Mr Barnett had been in Charleston for legal interviews linked to that case and he gave a formal deposition last week in which he was questioned by Boeing's lawyers, before being cross-examined by his own counsel.
He had been due to undergo further questioning on Saturday. When he did not appear, enquiries were made at his hotel.
He was subsequently found dead in his truck in the hotel car park.
Taking on his long-time employer had caused Mr Barnett to develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and his health had been in decline, his brother told US media.
""He was suffering from PTSD and anxiety attacks as a result of being subjected to the hostile work environment at Boeing, which we believe led to his death,"" Rodney Barnett said.
Mr Barnett added that his brother ""was looking forward to having his day in court and hoped that it would force Boeing to change its culture"".
The quality manager was known for raising concerns about the US plane giant's production standards, telling the BBC in 2019 that under-pressure workers had been deliberately fitting sub-standard parts to aircraft on the production line. He later told the BBC that workers had failed to follow procedures intended to track components through the factory, allowing defective components to go missing.
He also said he had uncovered serious problems with oxygen systems, which could mean one in four breathing masks would not work in an emergency.
He said soon after starting work in South Carolina he had become concerned that the push to get new aircraft built meant the assembly process was rushed and safety was compromised, something the company denied.
Mr Barnett said he had alerted managers to his concerns, but no action had been taken.
Boeing denied his assertions. However, a 2017 review by the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), did uphold some of Mr Barnett's concerns.
It established that the location of at least 53 ""non-conforming"" parts in the factory was unknown, and that they were considered lost.
On the oxygen cylinders issue, the company said that in 2017 it had ""identified some oxygen bottles received from the supplier that were not deploying properly"". But it denied that any of them were actually fitted on aircraft.
Mr Barnett's death comes at a time when production standards at both Boeing and its key supplier Spirit Aerosystems are under intense scrutiny.
Last week, the FAA said a six-week audit of the company had found ""multiple instances where the company allegedly failed to comply with manufacturing quality control requirements"".

2024-03-13T12:18:08.000Z,China says TikTok ban would 'come back to bite' the US,BBC News,"China has warned that a proposed ban on TikTok would ""come back to bite"" the US, ahead of a congressional vote that could lead to the app being banned.
The bill in the House of Representatives would force the Chinese-owned app to sever ties with China or become unavailable in the US.
US officials have long expressed concern about TikTok, citing potential national security risks.
TikTok's owners have repeatedly rejected that it poses any threat.
Ahead of Wednesday's vote, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin accused the US of ""suppressing TikTok"" despite the fact that it ""never found evidence that TikTok threatens national security.""
""This kind of bullying behaviour that cannot win in fair competition disrupts companies' normal business activity, damages the confidence of international investors in the investment environment, and damages the normal international economic and trade order,"" Mr Wang added.
""In the end, this will inevitably come back to bite the United States itself.""
The move was similarly pilloried by Chinese media, with several newspapers featuring satirical cartoons ridiculing the US effort to ban the app.
One newspaper, the Global Times, accused the US of ""ugly behaviour"" and abusing ""the concept of national security"" to seize the app ""by force"".
As is the case with other social media platforms, TikTok is banned in China. Users in the country use a similar app, Duoyin, which is only available in China and subject to monitoring and censorship by the government.
The House vote on the bill - officially known as the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act - is expected to take place at 10am ET (1400 GMT).
It is widely expected to pass, with bipartisan support from both sides of the political spectrum.
The bill would then head across Capitol Hill to the Senate, where it is unclear if it has enough support to pass.
If it does, the White House has said that President Joe Biden will sign it into law.
TikTok is owned by a Beijing-based, Cayman Islands-registered firm, Byte Dance.
If the US bill becomes law, ByteDance would be required to sell TikTok within six months or face a ban from US app stores and web hosting platforms.
Last week, TikTok distributed a message to many of its American users, calling on them to call their representatives to prevent the government from stripping ""170 million Americans of their Constitutional right to free speech.""
This, in turn, prompted a letter from the House China Select Committee telling the company to stop ""spreading false claims in its campaign to manipulate and mobilise American citizens on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party"".
TikTok has denied it has any links with China's government and said it has restructured the company to keep US data in the US.
Former President Donald Trump unsuccessfully tried to ban the app in 2020.
Mr Trump, who on Tuesday passed the delegate threshold to clinch the Republican nomination to become its presidential candidate, is now against the ban, saying it would unfairly benefit Facebook.

2024-03-12T15:41:39.000Z,Robert Hur: Who is the special counsel in the Biden documents case?,BBC News,"Robert Hur, who led the investigation into President Joe Biden's handling of classified documents, is no stranger to political pressure.
He faced heavy fire from both sides of the aisle during congressional testimony about his inquiry on Tuesday.
Republicans demanded to know why Mr Hur, 51, had decided not to prosecute the president.
Democrats attacked Mr Hur's remarks in his explosive report on Mr Biden's mental acuity.
During a tumultuous stint as a top aide to the deputy US attorney general under former President Donald Trump, Mr Hur was known for his unflappable demeanour.
In an interview with the New York Times, Mr Rosenstein said the department had found itself under a partisan microscope during that tenure.
Mr Rosenstein said he himself was at risk of being fired by Mr Trump because of his choice to appoint special counsel Robert Mueller to investigate Mr Trump's alleged ties to Russia.
""We were coming under tremendous criticism from the commentators - and the president - and Rob kept his head down, pushed ahead and never lost his sense of humour,"" Mr Rosenstein said of Mr Hur.
Over more than a decade as a federal prosecutor, Mr Hur has worked on cases involving national security, violent crime and public corruption.
He clerked for the late William Rehnquist, a conservative chief justice of the US Supreme Court who was originally appointed by Richard Nixon.
Mr Hur was an aide at the justice department to Christopher Wray, before Mr Wray was appointed in 2017 to head the FBI.
The son of Korean immigrants, Mr Hur graduated from Harvard College and Stanford Law School.
He met his future wife, then-law student Cara Brewer, in 2002 on the Washington DC subway as she pored over some legal notes, and invited her out for dinner on the spot. They wed two years later.
Mr Hur was appointed in 2017 by President Trump as the chief federal law enforcement officer in Maryland.
In that role, he handled a number of high-profile cases, including tax evasion charges against former Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh.
Mr Hur departed from that position when Mr Trump left office in 2021.
Despite his work in the Republican administration, Mr Hur drew praise at the time from Democrats.
As he left the federal government three years ago, Maryland's two senators, Chris Van Hollen and Ben Cardin, praised Mr Hur's ""excellent service"" in having ""faithfully followed the facts and the law"".
Yet Mr Hur has found himself in a political maelstrom since he released a 345-page report in February that alleged Mr Biden had ""wilfully retained and disclosed classified materials"", but should not face criminal charges.
Investigators interviewed 147 witnesses, including Mr Biden himself, whom Mr Hur said seemed to be a ""sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory"".
Mr Hur has maintained his composure as he faces pot shots from left and right. His unruffled approach will be no surprise to at least one colleague.
Mr Hur has most recently been in private practice as a partner at the Washington DC office of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher.
Thomas Dupree, who worked alongside Mr Hur at the law firm, described him as ""a very talented lawyer, a man of excellent judgment and a man of the highest integrity"".

2024-03-12T23:19:00.000Z,Aaron Rodgers and Jesse Ventura on RFK Jr vice-presidential shortlist,BBC News,"Independent presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr is considering American football quarterback Aaron Rodgers or former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura as his vice-presidential running mate.
They are among others on a shortlist of potential nominees, Mr Kennedy's campaign said on Tuesday.
Campaign officials would not confirm who else is on the list.
Mr Kennedy, 70, launched a bid for president last year.
He previously considering challenging Joe Biden for the Democratic Party nomination, and now as an independent faces a battle to get his name on the ballot in most or all 50 US states.
Mr Kennedy, a member of America's most famous political family, worked as an environmental lawyer before founding an anti-vaccine pressure group.
Mr Rodgers, a star quarterback who currently plays for the New York Jets, was injured at the start of his first game last season but has vowed to return to the game in 2024.
Off the field, he has been criticised for speaking about vaccine skepticism and making a number of controversial statements.
Mr Kennedy recently posted a picture of them hiking together.
It's unclear how the quarterback could combine a vice-presidential campaign with a gruelling NFL season that would clash with November's election.
Mr Ventura, a former professional wrestler and actor, was elected as governor of Minnesota as a member of the Reform Party, defeating both the Democrat and Republican nominees in a surprise upset in 1998.
He served one four-year term and since leaving office has regularly hinted about rejoining the political fray.
Starting in 2017, he hosted a show on Kremlin-owned RT America until the station ceased operations after the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Last month he appeared at a campaign event with Mr Kennedy in Arizona.
The BBC has reached out to both potential running mates for comment.
Ballot access rules for independent presidential candidates vary widely from state to state, with most requiring candidates to collect signatures before a summer deadline.
A number of states require independents to pick a vice-presidential running mate before applying for access.
The Kennedy campaign says it has so far qualified in four states - Utah, Nevada, New Hampshire and Hawaii.
American Values 2024, a political action committee backing Mr Kennedy - and which bankrolled a Super Bowl advertisement for his candidacy - says it has collected enough signatures to get his name on the ballot in Arizona and Georgia.

2024-03-12T21:58:45.000Z,Ghislaine Maxwell appeals sex abuse conviction,BBC News,"Lawyers for Ghislaine Maxwell have argued that she should be set free under the terms of a previous deal with federal prosecutors.
Maxwell, 62, was found guilty of helping disgraced financier Jeffery Epstein sexually abuse young girls.
She was sentenced to 20 years in prison in June 2022.
Her lawyer, Diane Fabi Samson, told a court in New York on Tuesday that the British socialite was covered by a previous deal with prosecutors.
But US government attorneys say that deal, which saw her boyfriend Epstein serve a light sentence for sex crimes, should not allow Maxwell to walk free.
Maxwell's appeal does not relate to the facts laid out at her trial but instead on the legal issues surrounding the agreement struck nearly 20 years ago.
The crimes of Epstein, who mixed with some of the world's most famous people, were first reported in the media in 2005.
In 2008, he made a deal with federal prosecutors that allowed him to plead guilty to state charges in Florida of soliciting and procuring a minor for prostitution and served 13 months in prison.
As part of his plea agreement, which was later criticised by a Justice Department internal report, prosecutors agreed not to pursue his alleged co-conspirators.
Following numerous lawsuits, Epstein was arrested again in 2019 in a federal case in New York. He was found dead in his jail cell before he could be tried on sex trafficking charges. His death was ruled a suicide.
During Tuesday's hearing, Ms Fabi Samson called the Florida plea deal ""weird"" and ""unusual"" but argued that it should have halted any further action against Maxwell.
Prosecutors, however, have called the defence arguments ""cursory and undeveloped"" and say that the deal has no bearing on Maxwell's case.
During the hearing they argued that the agreement was limited to the Florida district where Epstein pleaded guilty. Maxwell was convicted in New York, where Tuesday's appeal hearing was held.
Throughout the course of Maxwell's 2022 trial, four women testified that they had been abused as minors at Epstein's homes in Florida, New York, New Mexico and the Virgin Islands.
They recounted how Maxwell had talked them into giving Epstein massages which turned sexual, luring them with gifts and promises about how Epstein could use his money and connections to help them.
During her trial, a judge rejected attempts to throw out the case, including an argument by Maxwell's lawyers that a juror had failed to inform the court that he had been abused as a child.
The judge also rejected arguments that Maxwell had not been allowed to prepare adequately for her trial, and that prosecutors had waited too long to bring their case against her.
The appeals court judgement will be handed down at a later date.
Outside the court, Maxwell's lawyers told the reporters that they were ""cautiously optimistic"" about their prospects of winning the appeal.

2024-03-12T19:49:20.000Z,Biden classified files report: Robert Hur hearing highlights partisan divide,BBC News,"Five weeks after his report into Joe Biden's handling of classified documents exploded a political bombshell, former special counsel Robert Hur appeared at a hearing in Congress to explain and defend his work.
Although Mr Hur declined to pursue a criminal case against Mr Biden or any of his associates, his report became a political lightning rod for how it depicted the president of the US.
It characterised him as a ""well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory"". It also cited instances of Mr Biden being unable to recall some details, which prompted an angry response from the president who insisted his memory was fine.
Not surprisingly, his memory and mental acuity featured prominently at the hearing, which was a clear demonstration of the sharp partisan divide over the report.
Here are some key takeaways.
The hearings began with duelling videos. Republicans played Mr Biden's impromptu press conference responding to the Hur report, during which he at times appeared angry and flustered and confused the leaders of Egypt and Mexico.
Democrats countered with an unflattering montage of clips of Donald Trump, Mr Biden's likely Republican opponent in November, in which the former president garbled words and admitted lapses of memory.
It was an early indication of the Democratic strategy to counter Republican accusations that Mr Biden is senile by claiming Mr Trump is just as bad - if not worse.
Republicans also quickly accused the Justice Department of having a two-tiered standard for prosecution, claiming that Mr Biden avoided charges while special counsel Jack Smith indicted Mr Trump for his handling of classified documents found at his Mar-a-Lago club.
""Justice for thee, but not for me,"" said New Jersey Republican Jeff Van Drew.
""Trump is worse"" is a familiar page out of the Biden presidential campaign's playbook, but on Tuesday both sides had opportunities to launch campaign-style salvos at each other.
With the president's team trying to paint their candidate as substantially more ethical than Mr Trump, a fight to a draw here may have helped the Trump side level the playing field on what could have been a damaging topic.
Hours before Mr Hur began his testimony, the Justice Department released a transcript of the president's interview with the special counsel's team.
In his report, the special counsel offered several examples of what he described as Mr Biden's memory lapses. Some, such as the president's inability to remember when his vice-presidential term ended, are fairly clear. Others, such as the exact date of his son Beau's death are a bit more complicated.
The president recalled the exact day and date of his son's death but the year - 2015 - was quickly provided by an aide. On multiple occasions, in fact, the president's aides would chime in with information if Mr Biden appeared to be hesitating.
Whether these instances should have been more generally described as signs of a failing memory prompted one of the more heated exchanges of the hearing, as Democrat Adam Schiff of California pressed the special counsel on whether he knew the ""political firestorm"" his conclusions would create.
""You were not born yesterday, you understood exactly what you were doing,"" he said. ""It was a political choice. It was the wrong choice.""
Mr Hur countered that he was required to include his reasoning in his report to the attorney general and that he refused to ""shape, sanitise or omit portions of my reasoning for political reasons"".
Committee Republicans repeatedly turned to the president's communications with Mark Zwonitzer, a ghostwriter who worked on Mr Biden's two memoirs.
Mr Zwonitzer tried to delete audio recordings of his conversations with Mr Biden for those books after learning Mr Hur had been appointed special counsel. That prompted Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz to wonder why the ghostwriter wasn't charged with obstruction of justice.
""What does somebody have to do to get charged with obstruction of justice by you,"" Mr Gaetz, a Republican, asked. ""If deleting the evidence of crimes doesn't count, what would meet the standard?""
Mr Hur said the audio files were less important because the ghostwriter kept transcripts.
Jim Jordan, the Judiciary Committee's Republican chairman, suggested Mr Biden, who received an $8m advance on one of his memoirs, had a financial motivation for saving classified documents - so he could share them with his ghostwriter.
""Joe Biden had 8 million reasons to break the rules,"" he said.
Mr Hur began his testimony, as many witnesses under the national spotlight do, by recounting his personal story. He's a child of Korean immigrants who came to the US to seek a better life.
""I'm privileged to have served our country for the majority of my career,"" he noted, before launching into a full-throated defence of his report and its conclusions.
Over the next three hours, the former special counsel was hit from both sides of the political divide. He largely remained composed under the spotlight.
When Democrat Hank Johnson of Georgia accused him of trying to help Mr Trump get elected so he could be appointed to a federal judgeship, Mr Hur showed a rare flash of anger.
""I have no such aspirations,"" he said. ""Partisan politics had no place whatsoever in my work.""
With his testimony completed and his investigation closed, Mr Hur may be able to step out of the spotlight for as long as he desires.
Congressional Republicans aren't done with their investigations, however. They are still seeking access to video recordings of Mr Hur's interviews, which could spark another round of embarrassing or politically damaging revelations for the president and his staff.

2024-03-11T22:53:07.000Z,Desperate TikTok lobbying effort backfires on Capitol Hill,BBC News,"US congressional offices have told the BBC they are being deluged with calls from TikTok users about legislation that could see the popular app banned.
Callers range from teenagers to the elderly, and most are ""really confused and are calling because 'TikTok told me to'"", one Republican staffer revealed.
A Democratic staffer said the most aggressive and threatening calls their office received came from adult women.
So far, TikTok's big mobilization appears to be backfiring.
Lawmakers and their staff say that the lobbying campaign has actually worsened the concerns they have about the app and its parent company ByteDance, and strengthened their resolve to pass the legislation.
The bill, introduced by a bipartisan group of 20 lawmakers, would mandate that ByteDance sell TikTok within six months, or TikTok would be removed from mobile app stores in the US.
The legislation is sailing through Congress, winning rare unanimous approval from a key committee, and the full House is expected to vote on it on Wednesday. President Joe Biden has said that he will sign it into law if it reaches his desk.
Its swift advance has drawn a frantic last-minute push by TikTok to mobilise users directly against those responsible for the legislation.
TikTok confirmed to the BBC it had sent a notification urging TikTokers to ""call your representative now"" to urge them to vote against the measure. Users said that the app gave them a direct link for calling the representatives for their districts.
Florida Congressman Neal Dunn's office told the BBC it has received more than 900 calls from TikTokers, ""many of which were vulnerable school-aged children"" and some of whose extreme rhetoric had to be flagged for security reasons.
Mr Dunn, a Republican, is an original co-sponsor of the bill.
""This effort by ByteDance validated the Congressman's concerns,"" his office said in a statement.
""American phones were geolocated and TikTok users were locked out of the platform until they called their members of Congress. ByteDance weaponized the app against America, and that is exactly why the Congressman supports this measure.""
When contacted about those allegations by the BBC, TikTok provided the statement: ""With regards to users being locked out of the app until they called, that is false. All users had two methods for dismissing the notifications.""
Lawmakers have long accused ByteDance of having links to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and have cast the video-sharing app as a potential threat to Americans' privacy and mental health. TikTok, which says it is now used by more than 170 million people in the US, and ByteDance deny those claims.
Carlos Gimenez,  who sits alongside Mr Dunn on the House committee behind the bill, said he would not be deterred from voting for it ""regardless of TikTok's targeted campaign against members of Congress"".
A spokesperson for New York Democrat Ritchie Torres - a joint leader of the legislation - confirmed that his office too has received ""seemingly endless calls"" though none were of a threatening nature.
""I am deeply troubled by reports of young people calling Congress, threatening to commit suicide or otherwise harm themselves,"" Mr Torres said in a statement to the BBC.
""The iron grip that TikTok has on the minds of young people is a profound public health hazard.""
Staffers to other lawmakers on both sides of the aisle also reported hundreds of calls to their offices, from app users young and old, who did not have a clear idea of either who or why they were calling.
A spokesperson for Dusty Johnson told the BBC his office had received calls from people who were very upset, as well as ""some people who are asking kindly if TikTok is going to be banned, and some have said TikTok wouldn't let them on the app without calling their [representative]"".
The callers had been of all ages, the spokesperson added.
Mr Johnson, a South Dakota Republican, has been outspoken about the national security threat posed by TikTok and is supportive of the proposed bill.
11 March 2024 - This story was updated to clarify comments made by a spokesperson for Dusty Johnson.

2024-03-11T20:25:29.000Z,Trump says a TikTok ban would only help 'enemy of the people' Facebook,BBC News,"Former US President Donald Trump has criticised a congressional bill to force TikTok's parent company to sell the app or see it banned in the US.
Mr Trump, who attempted to ban TikTok in 2020 while in the White House, said the proposal would give unfair advantages to Facebook owner Meta.
Lawmakers are debating a measure that would force TikTok parent company ByteDance to sell it by 30 September.
President Joe Biden has said he will sign the bill if it passes.
""Without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people,"" Mr Trump told NBC on Monday.
Asked about app's security, the Republican presidential candidate said ""there's a lot of good and there's a lot of bad"" with the social media platform.
""There are a lot of people on TikTok that love it. There are a lot of young kids on TikTok who will go crazy without it,"" Mr Trump added.
The US intelligence community has warned that the Chinese government is using TikTok in attempts to sow doubt about US leadership and undermine democracy.
In an annual report on threats to US security, released on Monday, the Office of the Director of National intelligence wrote that TikTok accounts from the Chinese government's propaganda arm ""reportedly targeted candidates from both political parties during the U.S. midterm election cycle in 2022"".
Mr  Trump said in his NBC interview that he agreed with those who see TikTok as a national security threat, but argued that Facebook was also a threat to the US government.
""I think Facebook has been very bad for our country, especially when it comes to elections,"" Mr Trump added.
Shares in Facebook's parent company Meta fell sharply after the attack, dropping more than 4% on a day when stocks were generally flat. Shares in its smaller social media rival, Snap, were also lower.
Mr Trump's comments offered a preview of the heightened political scrutiny social media firms are likely to face this year as the presidential election in November draws near.
TikTok last faced a serious campaign for a sale or ban in 2020, the last time Mr Trump and Mr Biden were vying for the White House.
At the time, American officials said they feared that data from ByteDance - a Chinese tech giant - could fall into the hands of the Chinese government.
TikTok executives deny sharing any data with Beijing, and maintain they would refuse to do so if asked.
In 2020, Mr Trump signed a presidential executive order that directed ByteDance to sell off TikTok within 90 days, but it was stymied by legal challenges.
Meta removed his accounts following the US Capitol riot in 2021.
Club for Growth, a conservative lobbying group that is close with Mr Trump, has taken a strong stand against the proposed TikTok ban.
Last week Mr Trump met a major donor to the group, billionaire hedge fund manager Jeff Yass.
Kellyanne Conway, who was one of Mr Trump's top aides in the White House, has in recent months been lobbying for TikTok in Congress on behalf of the Club for Growth.
Meanwhile, the Justice Department, FBI and other national security officials plan on Tuesday to brief all members of the House of Representatives on TikTok, one of the most popular apps in the US, especially among younger people, according to the BBC's media partner CBS News.
The bipartisan bill passed a congressional committee last week by a vote of 50-0.
The Senate must also vote to approve the bill before it could be signed into law.

2024-03-13T13:40:33.000Z,Paul Alexander: 'Man in the iron lung' dies at the age of 78,BBC News,"The polio survivor known as ""the man in the iron lung"" has died at the age of 78.
Paul Alexander contracted polio in 1952 when he was six, leaving him paralysed from the neck down.
The disease left him unable to breathe independently, leading doctors to place him in the metal cylinder, where he would spend the rest of his life.
He would go on to earn a law degree - and practise law - as well as publish a memoir.
""Paul Alexander, 'The Man in the Iron Lung', passed away yesterday,"" a post on a fundraising website said.
""In this time Paul went to college, became a lawyer, and a published author.
""Paul was an incredible role model.""
In 1952, when he became ill, doctors in his hometown of Dallas operated on him, saving his life. But polio meant his body was no longer able to breathe on his own.
The answer was to place him in a so-called iron lung - a metal cylinder enclosing his body up to his neck.
The lung, which he called his ""old iron horse"", allowed him to breathe. Bellows sucked air out of the cylinder, forcing his lungs to expand and take in air. When the air was let back in, the same process in reverse made his lungs deflate.
After years, Alexander eventually learned to breathe by himself so that he was able to leave the lung for short periods of time.
Like most polio survivors placed in iron lungs, he was not expected to survive long. But he lived for decades, long after the invention of the polio vaccine in the 1950s all but eradicated the disease in the Western world.
He graduated from high school, then attended the Southern Methodist University. In 1984, he gained a law degree from the University of Texas at Austin. Admitted to the bar two years later, he practiced as a lawyer for decades.
""I knew if I was going to do anything with my life, it was going to have to be a mental thing,"" he told the Guardian in 2020.
That year, he published a memoir which reportedly took him eight years to write using a plastic stick to type on a keyboard and dictating to a friend.
Advances in medicine made iron lungs obsolete by the 1960s, replaced by ventilators. But Alexander kept living in the cylinder because, he said, he was used to it.
He was recognised by Guinness World Records as the person who lived the longest in an iron lung.

Itay Chen was a soldier for the IDF serving near the Gaza border.
The 19-year-old's body was taken by Hamas after he was killed and remains in Gaza, the IDF said on Tuesday.
More than 100 Israeli hostages are still thought to be held alive by Hamas.
The war began when Hamas gunmen attacked southern Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people and seizing 253 hostages. More than 31,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's retaliatory air strikes and its ongoing ground offensive, the Hamas-run health ministry says.
President Joe Biden said he and first lady Jill Biden were devastated to learn of Chen's passing.
""Today, our hearts are heavy,"" he said in a statement. ""I reaffirm my pledge to all the families of those still held hostage: we are with you. We will never stop working to bring your loved ones home.""
Mr Biden said Chen's father and brother came to the White House in December to ""share the agony and uncertainty they've faced as they prayed for the safe return of their loved one"".
""No one should have to endure even one day of what they have gone through,"" Mr Biden said.
In a statement, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said it shared ""in the profound grief of the Chen family"".
""Itay loved the land, going on hikes, and was a senior instructor in youth movements - a salt of the earth person,"" the group wrote on X.
Chen had decided to work at his base on the Gaza border on 7 October to get time off for his brother's bar mitzvah, a ceremony that marks the transition into Jewish adulthood.
His family lost communication with him after he told them his base was under attack.
""No one has been able to physically locate him - he is not in hospital, not on the deceased list,"" his father Ruby Chen, said at a news conference after the attacks.
One hundred and thirty four people are still being held hostage by Hamas in Gaza, including 34 who are believed to be dead, Israeli government spokesperson Eylon Levy wrote on Tuesday in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.
Hopes that a 40-day ceasefire agreement could be reached before the start of the Islamic month of Ramadan this week have faded.
During a week-long ceasefire in late November, 105 hostages - most of them women and children - were freed in return for some 240 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails.
Israel says there have been 590 Israeli military casualties since 7 October.

The settlement, announced on Monday, clarifies the scope of a controversial state education law, but left it standing.
Plaintiffs had challenged Florida's 2022 parental rights bill, arguing it could marginalise LGBT youth.
Both Florida officials and the plaintiffs claimed victory on Monday.
Roberta Kaplan, the lead lawyer in the lawsuit, said in a statement that the legal settlement provides ""much-needed clarity"" and ""represents a major victory for the many thousands of LGBTQ+ students, teachers, parents, and their allies throughout Florida"".
Florida Governor Ron Desantis's office called it a ""major win"".
""We fought hard to ensure this law couldn't be maligned in court, as it was in the public arena by the media and large corporate actors,"" said general counsel Ryan Newman.
The Parental Rights in Education Act - dubbed by critics as the ""Don't Say Gay"" bill - initially prohibited classroom discussion and instruction about gender identity and sexual orientation in kindergarten through third grade in state public schools.
That was later expanded to all grades through high school.
The law sparked a political firestorm, receiving rebuke from LGBT and civil rights groups as well as from major companies like Disney, which has a large presence in the state, and President Joe Biden.
The plaintiffs challenging the law argued its vague language would have a chilling effect in schools and lead to confusion about what teachers were allowed to discuss with their students, including things like sharing details about their family lives.
Mr DeSantis, a Republican, has claimed critics deliberately misrepresented the law.
Now, the settlement clarifies that the law ""restricts instruction on particular subjects (sexual orientation and gender identity) not mere discussion of them"".
Allowed under the law are ""incidental"" references in literature to gay or transgender people or same-sex couples.
It would also not restrict ""lines referring to LGBTQ issues"" in musicals, ""dancing between persons of the same gender"" at school dances, or references in a classroom to a person's family.
It doesn't apply to library books not being used in instruction, and it allows students to participate in extracurricular activities like joining a school Gay-Straight Alliance.
It also clarifies the law is ""neutral"", meaning limits on instruction apply to both both LBGT and heterosexual topics.
According to the terms of the settlement, the Florida Department of Education must provide a copy of the agreement and the guidelines it establishes to the school boards in each state school district.

2024-03-13T10:06:44.000Z,Biden and Trump set for election rematch after clinching nominations,BBC News,"US President Joe Biden and his predecessor Donald Trump have both passed the delegate thresholds to clinch their parties' nominations.
They each won several states in primary elections on Tuesday to propel them over the finish line.
The two 2020 contenders will provide the US with its first rematch in a presidential election for 70 years.
Polling suggests it will be a tight race that will come down to narrow margins in a few key states.
The nominations will be made official at party conventions this summer.
The 81-year-old president said on Tuesday evening that he was ""honoured"" voters had backed his re-election bid ""in a moment when the threat Trump poses is greater than ever"".
Citing positive economic trends, he asserted the US was ""in the middle of a comeback"", but faced challenges to its future as a democracy, as well as from those seeking to pass abortion restrictions and cut social programmes.
""I believe that the American people will choose to keep us moving into the future,"" Mr Biden said in a statement from his campaign.
Incumbency gave Mr Biden a natural advantage and he faced no serious challengers for the Democratic nomination.
Despite persistent concerns from voters that his age limits his ability to perform the duties of the presidency, the party apparatus rallied around him.
Meanwhile, Mr Trump, 77, remains very popular with the Republican voter base, which has propelled him to victory in primary after primary over well-funded rivals.
His campaign for a second term in the White House has zeroed in on stricter immigration laws, including a pledge to ""seal the border"" and implement ""record-setting"" deportations.
Mr Trump has also vowed to fight crime, boost domestic energy production, tax foreign imports, end the war in Ukraine and resume an ""America first"" approach to global affairs.
Tuesday night's results do not come as a shock, as both men have dominated their races so far.
Both their re-nominations seemed all but predetermined, despite polling that indicates Americans are dissatisfied with the prospect of another showdown between Mr Biden and Mr Trump in November.
The US presidential primaries and caucuses are a state-by-state competition to secure the most party delegates.
The Democrats and the Republicans have slightly different rules for their primaries, but the process is essentially the same.
Each state is allocated a certain share of party delegates, which are awarded either as a whole to the winning candidate or proportionally, based on the results.
A Republican candidate must secure at least 1,215 of their party's delegates during the primary season to win their presidential nomination, while a Democrat must secure 1,968.
On Tuesday, Republicans held primaries in Mississippi, Georgia and Washington State, as well as a caucus in Hawaii.
Democrats, meanwhile, held primaries in the states of Georgia, Washington and Mississippi, as well as in the Northern Mariana Islands and for Democrats living abroad.
Mr Biden and Mr Trump's main competitors had dropped out before Tuesday's primary contests, so the results had been all but certain.
Former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley, Mr Trump's last remaining rival, dropped out earlier this month after losing 14 states to Mr Trump on Super Tuesday.
Although several more states have yet to hold their primary contests, with Mr Trump and Mr Biden over the delegate threshold, the 2024 general election is now in effect under way.
The US presidential election will be held on 5 November 2024.

The data comes as the country is set to hold a general election this year.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi posted on the social media platform X, formerly Twitter, that it shows ""the strength of Indian economy and its potential"".
India is forecast to overtake Japan and Germany as the world's third biggest economy in the next few years.
The better-than-expected growth was led by a strong performance by the country's manufacturers, with the sector expanding by 11.6% in the period.
Private consumption, which makes up almost two-thirds of the country's gross domestic product (GDP), also rose by 3.5%.
People's spending power was affected last year due to high prices of staple foods such as onions. That led to the government introducing a number of measures to help curb food price inflation.
In recent years, Prime Minister Modi has raised government spending on infrastructure and offered incentives to boost the manufacturing of phones, electronics, drones and semiconductors to help India compete on the international market.
On Thursday, the government gave the greenlight to the construction of three semiconductor plants worth 1.26 trillion rupees ($15.2bn; £12bn) by firms including Indian conglomerate Tata.
But the agricultural sector, which accounts for about 15% of the $3.7tn (£2.93tn) economy, continued to struggle because of weak monsoon rains.
Some farmers have been protesting to demand minimum crop prices.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects India's economy to expand by 6.5% in 2024, compared with 4.6% for China.
Beijing is under growing pressure to unveil stimulus measures to support the world's second biggest economy which is facing a number of challenges including a property market crisis, high youth unemployment and falling prices, known as deflation.

2024-02-23T10:36:52.000Z,Typical energy bill to fall £238 a year from April under new price cap,BBC News,"The typical annual energy bill will fall to £1,690 from April to the lowest for two years under the new price cap set by the regulator.
It means a drop of £238 a year, or around £20 a month, for a household using a typical amount of energy.
Lower wholesale prices paid by suppliers have led to the cut in the price cap for April to June, which will bring some relief to billpayers.
But campaigners said bills are still high and many will struggle to pay.
Energy prices are now at their lowest level since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. However, even after April's drop, bills will remain well above pre-pandemic levels.
The regulator's price cap affects 29 million households in England, Wales and Scotland. Rules are different in Northern Ireland, where prices are also falling.
Ofgem sets the maximum amount suppliers can charge for each unit of gas and electricity but not the total bill - so if you use more, you will pay more.
Specifically, in England, Wales and Scotland:
The regulator will add £28 to everyone's bill over a year to cover the cost of dealing with £3.1bn of debt that customers owe to suppliers.
Energy firms will contact customers before April to inform them of the new prices.
However, whether customers' direct debits fall automatically may depend on whether they have a surplus balance with their energy supplier. If people feel they are paying too much they should contact their supplier to discuss cutting payments.
Dame Clare Moriarty, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: ""It's good news that the cost of energy is falling, but the impact of sky-high prices will be felt for years to come.""
Families - like mum Sam, from Greater Manchester, and her sons Reuben, eight, and Jenson, 10 - have been working hard to keep bills down by cutting their energy usage.
""I put the heating on in the morning, just to give it a little blast when the boys get up and then maybe at the evening time just for an hour, but we just try and cut back as much as possible. And I wear as many clothes, coats and things, as I can especially when I'm working from home.
""The boys are very aware of it because we talk openly about it,"" she said. ""That's why, as much as they do think I'm always nagging them, it's just about trying to save money and save on energy.""
She said that the lower prices would take the pressure off and give ""a little bit of room in the budget"" but they would continue to save energy as much as they can.
The fall in energy prices has raised the prospect of suppliers trying to attract new customers by offering improved deals.
Richard Neudegg from online price comparison website USwitch said: ""We expect there to be increased competition on the market now prices are set to fall in April.""
The vast majority of people pay by direct debit, with payments smoothed out over the year. However, those who pay via prepayment meter - so pay for energy as they use it - would have benefitted more had the cut come over the winter.
Ofgem chief executive Jonathan Brearley said that by April, energy bills for the average household will have fallen by £690 since the peak of the crisis.
""But there are still big issues that we must tackle head-on to ensure we build a system that's more resilient for the long term and fairer to customers,"" he said.
Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, Mr Brearley said the regulator was looking at standing charges - a fixed daily amount which covers the costs of connecting to a supply.
There has been criticism about increases to these charges, and some have argued they should be abolished.
But Mr Brearley said the issues were complex: ""The analysis we've done says there's a large group who are made somewhat better off [by abolishing it], but there's a big but slightly smaller group who are made significantly worse off.""
In the winter of 2022-23, overall energy prices were high and rises would have been bigger had it not been for the government's Energy Price Guarantee limiting the typical bill to £2,500.
Each household also received £400 of support over six months, but the government did not repeat the discount this winter.
Cost-of-living payments seem set to end following a final instalment this month, and no plans have been announced for a continuation of the Household Support Fund, which councils use to offer direct support.
Chancellor Jeremy Hunt could choose to address future support when he presents his Budget on 6 March.
A spokesman for the Department for Energy Security said: ""We've halved inflation and energy prices are now significantly lower than their peak - but we recognise the challenges families are still facing.""
With plans to create more flexible tariffs, Energy Security Secretary Claire Coutinho said: ""My mission is to cut costs and get bills even lower so that families can spend their money on the things that matter most to them.""
Labour's shadow energy secretary, Ed Miliband, said: ""Whilst it is welcome the price cap is coming down, the truth is that energy bills are still far too high for hardworking families.

2024-02-23T02:11:12.000Z,Vice Media stops publishing on website and cuts hundreds of jobs,BBC News,"Vice Media plans to cut hundreds of jobs as it stops publishing on Vice.com, according to a memo from chief executive Bruce Dixon.
In May, the firm filed for bankruptcy in the US and was bought by Fortress Investment Group.
Mr Dixon said Vice plans to ""partner with established media companies to distribute our digital content"".
Media firms including Channel 4, Los Angeles Times, and Business Insider have also cut jobs this year.
Mr Dixon said ""it is no longer cost-effective for us to distribute our digital content the way we have done previously,"" in the memo seen by the BBC.
""Regrettably, this means that we will be reducing our workforce, eliminating several hundred positions,"" he said.
The company continues to sell the business, according to Mr Dixon who said the announcement will be made in the coming weeks.
Before filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, a procedure which postpones a US company's obligations to its creditors, Vice announced previous layoffs by shutting down its flagship TV programme.
Launched in 1994 as a fringe magazine called Voice of Montreal by Shane Smith, Gavin McInnes and Suroosh Alvi, Vice Media operates in more than 30 countries.
The company was valued at $5.7bn (£4.5bn) in 2017 and was once heralded as part of vanguard of companies set to disrupt the traditional media landscape with edgy, youth-focused content spanning print, events, music, online, TV and feature films.
The hope was that Vice would attract millions of younger people through social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram.
The firm's production included My Journey Inside the Islamic State, in which a Vice journalist filmed alongside the terror group in Syria. Vice also followed basketball star Dennis Rodman and the Harlem Globetrotters team on a ""sports diplomacy"" trip to North Korea.
More recent content included documentaries about controversial influencer Andrew Tate and a film about Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, by actor Sean Penn.
However, the company's revenues have been flat for some years and it has also struggled to turn a profit. Vice's plans to go public through a merger also failed.

2024-02-21T10:53:52.000Z,Government finances show big surplus in January,BBC News,"The government finances showed a large surplus last month, more than double the surplus last January.
The surplus - the difference between spending and tax income - rose to £16.7bn in January, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.
These are the last set of public finance figures to be released before the Chancellor's Budget in March.
Jeremy Hunt has hinted he wants to cut taxes, but analysts said the surplus is unlikely to lead to big changes.
Despite being the highest surplus in nominal terms since monthly records began in 1993, it was lower than most economists had predicted.
But it is still likely to fuel calls for tax cuts in the forthcoming Budget, which many see as the government's last chance to win round voters before a general election later this year.
The ONS said the surplus was the result of higher tax receipts and lower spending, with the government no longer subsiding household energy bills for example.
Every January, the government tends to take more in tax than it spends in other months due to the amount it receives in self-assessed taxes, according to the ONS.
In addition, the cost of financing the UK's debt has gone down as inflation has fallen.
""Overall expenditure was down on this time last year, despite increased spending on public services and benefits,"" said Jessica Barnaby, deputy director for public sector at the ONS.
Chief secretary to the Treasury, Laura Trott said: ""While we will not speculate over whether further reductions in tax will be affordable in the Budget, the economy is beginning to turn a corner, with inflation down from over 11% to 4%.""
For the year as a whole, to April, the government is only on track to undershoot its forecast by between £10bn to £20bn. Chancellors usually allow some headroom in the finances, to allow for unforeseen changes in economic fortunes.
Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets, Hargreaves Lansdown said the figures represented a boost to the chancellor's coffers, but were not big enough for a ""Budget bonanza"".
""It offers a few inches of headroom for Hunt, but not enough for a Budget of dramatic tax cuts,"" she said.
Capital Economics, an economics think tank, suggested using the added room for manoeuvre that the chancellor will have as a result of the surplus amounted to ""putting the election before prudence"".
In the year from April 2023 public borrowing has totalled £96.6bn.
Overall the UK's debt has risen compared to a year ago and remains at levels last seen in the early 1960s, the ONS said, at around 96.5% of the size of the economy, measured by GDP.
One of the government's key pledges is that debt should be falling as a percentage of GDP in five years' time.
The debate over whether January's surplus in the government's finances leaves room for tax cuts comes against a mixed economic backdrop.
The latest growth figures show that the UK went into a shallow recession in the second half of last year, although the governor of the Bank of England suggested this week that there were already ""distinct signs of an upturn"".
The Resolution Foundation has warned that if the chancellor does cut tax in the forthcoming Budget, it would amount to a ""tax sandwich"" with any tax cut sitting between substantial tax rises in the years before and after it.
""Juicy tax cuts in this election year are sandwiched between far bigger tax rises already introduced last year. And highly unusually the government has already announced plans for a chunky package of tax rises that will come into effect after polling day,"" said James Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation.

2024-02-26T15:53:17.000Z,Housebuilders probed over sharing prices privately,BBC News,"Some of the UK's biggest housebuilders are being investigated over whether they have been sharing information which could influence house prices.
The Competition and Markets Authority has launched the probe after a year-long investigation into housebuilding in England, Wales and Scotland.
It also said ""significant intervention"" in the market was needed to ensure enough homes were built to meet demand.
The watchdog also raised concerns over the quality of new homes.
The CMA said that its investigation had uncovered evidence suggesting ""information sharing"", which ""could be influencing the build-out of sites and the prices of new homes"".
CMA chief executive Sarah Cardell told the BBC: ""Through our investigation we've seen evidence of potential exchanges of confidential, commercially sensitive information relating to sales prices and sale rates between some of the UK's major housebuilders.
""Now we don't believe that that's a key driver of the fundamental poor outcomes in this market, but it is clearly critically important that all companies comply with competition law so today, we're also announcing the launch of a new Competition Act investigation to look into that further.""
The housebuilders being investigated are:
The CMA said it had not yet reached any conclusions as to whether or not competition law had been broken.
But it said that any sharing by housebuilders of non-public information - such as house prices, incentives to buy and rates of sales - may have the ""effect of preventing, restricting or distorting competition"".
Housebuilding companies listed on the London Stock Exchange saw their share prices fall in early trading. Persimmon shares fell by 2.8% to £13.74 each, closely followed by Taylor Wimpey down 2.7% at 142p.
A spokesperson for Taylor Wimpey said the housebuilder ""notes the investigation opened today and we will co-operate fully with the CMA in relation to this"".
A Bellway spokesperson said: ""We are reviewing the CMA's report. Bellway has engaged and co-operated fully with the CMA throughout its market study - and will continue to do so.""
Redrow, which recently agreed to be taken over by Barratt for £2.5bn, said that it had ""fully co-operated with the CMA throughout its market study"" and continues to work with the watchdog.
Berkeley declined to comment.
A spokesperson for Bloor Homes, said: ""We have been transparent with the CMA throughout the year-long study and are currently reviewing the findings."" The firm said it would continue to work with the regulator during the investigation.
The BBC has contacted Barratt, Persimmon and Vistry for comment.
In its wider report into the housebuilding market in England, Wales and Scotland, the CMA said there were ""persistent shortfalls"" in the number of homes being built.
""Too few houses are being built, especially in the areas in which they are most needed, which is having a negative effect on affordability,"" it said.
Last year, fewer than 250,000 homes were built across the whole of the UK, far below a target of 300,000 for England alone.
In its 2019 manifesto, the Conservative Party promised to build 300,000 homes a year by the mid-2020s and pledged to make the planning system ""simpler"".
In late 2022, Housing Secretary Michael Gove asked the CMA to conduct a market study into the UK housebuilding market, which the watchdog began in February the following year.
The CMA found that the planning system was one of the key factors slowing down construction of new homes, describing it as ""complex and unpredictable"".
It said planning often takes a long time for builders to navigate before construction can start. It found that many planning departments are under resourced, don't have up-to-date local plans and lack clear targets or incentives to deliver a certain number of homes in their area.
Builders also often have to consult with a wide range of people and slow responses to planning proposals can delay construction.
The CMA said that recommendations to streamline the planning system as well as other measures would mean more homes could be built each year and help ""make homes more affordable"".
But it said: ""Even then, further action may be required to deliver the number of homes Great Britain needs in the places it needs them.""
The report also highlighted the high costs that people who live on new-build housing estates pay for private estate management companies to maintain public amenities, including roads, sewers and open spaces.
It said that increasingly, private companies provide and charge for these kind of services, whereas in the past, local authorities would oversee them.
It means that some homeowners are paying for both private estate management and council tax.
The CMA said the amount charged by estate management companies each year varies, from £60 to just under £1,000 in some cases.
It said the average charge was £358 in 2022 though that could increase significantly in subsequent years.
In some cases, a higher proportion of the money that homeowners pay to these management companies goes towards fees rather than actual maintenance work.
""Our analysis of data from management companies and submissions from homeowners has shown that such fees can amount to around 60% of the total amount charged,"" said the CMA.
The watchdog also found that while some homeowners were made aware of estate management arrangements and their charges before buying a house, they were not informed about the long-term implications for selling the property at a later date.

2024-02-09T14:00:25.000Z,Barclays to end direct financing of new oil and gas fields,BBC News,"Barclays has announced it will no longer provide direct funding for new oil and gas projects.
The banking giant also says it will restrict lending to energy businesses that plan to expand their fossil fuel production.
Barclays is a major lender to the fossil fuel industry, but has been coming under mounting pressure to curb its support for the sector.
Campaign groups welcomed the move, but insisted it did not go far enough.
According to a report from environmental group Rainforest Action Network, Barclays was the biggest funder of the fossil fuel sector in Europe between 2016 and 2021.
It provided just under $16.5bn (£13bn) in 2022, although that was significantly lower than in previous years. In 2019 and 2020, the figure was more than $30bn.
However, the bank has been under pressure from environmental campaigners, shareholder activists and even celebrities to curb its support.
Last year, a campaign group including the actress Emma Thompson and the film director Richard Curtis called on the All England Lawn Tennis Club to remove Barclays as a sponsor of Wimbledon. They claimed the bank was ""profiting from climate chaos"".
In what it called a Climate Change Statement, Barclays announced it would no longer provide direct funding for projects designed to expand oil and gas production, or infrastructure related to such projects.
It said it would also end direct funding for any oil and gas projects in the Amazon or in the Arctic Circle, or which were aimed at extracting, processing or transporting oil from oil sands.
But direct funding for specific projects makes up only part of Barclays' overall lending to the sector.
The bank said there would also be restrictions on new financing for energy groups themselves, although these will be stricter for new clients than existing ones.
The plan is not wholly focused on oil and gas. There will also be curbs on lending linked to coal mining and coal-fired power generation.
Barclays is not the first bank in Europe to introduce such commitments. HSBC, Lloyds, BNP Paribas, Societe Generale and Credit Agricole have all previously announced restrictions on funding for fossil fuels.
The latest announcement was welcomed by ShareAction, a group that campaigns for responsible investment, but it complained that there were loopholes in the plan.
""Barclays is wrong not to have ruled out financing companies that focus exclusively on fossil fuel extraction,"" it said.
""This should include fracking, which is causing so much environmental and social harm and is an activity the bank is heavily exposed to.""
Meanwhile, Make My Money Matter, the group that includes Thompson and Curtis, said Barclays' plan was ""inadequate in scope and in ambition"".
Its chief executive, Tony Burdon, said: ""While they finally caught up with other major European banks like Lloyds by ruling out direct project finance for fossil fuels, the reality is this covers just a fraction of their oil and gas lending.
""This new policy lets them continue funnelling billions to those companies developing catastrophic new fossil fuel projects around the world.""
Barclays has pointed out that oil and gas funding represents a very small proportion of its overall activities.

2024-02-07T03:31:06.000Z,DBS: Singapore's biggest bank cuts executive pay after outages,BBC News,"Singapore's biggest bank DBS has slashed its CEO's bonus by 30% after disruptions to its digital services, despite it posting a record profit.
The company said the cut to Piyush Gupta's variable pay amounts to S$4.14m ($3.1m; £2.4m) and that his full salary for 2023 will be disclosed in March.
In 2022 Mr Gupta was paid S$15.4m.
After several glitches last year, the country's central bank banned DBS from buying new businesses or making non-essential IT changes for six months.
The outages saw digital payment services and cash machines go offline across the city-state.
At the time, DBS apologised and announced plans to improve the resiliency of its systems.
In its latest statement, the bank said other members of its management team will have their variable pay cut by 21%, while more junior employees will get a one-off bonus to help them with higher living costs.
DBS' variable pay is made of both a cash bonus and deferred shares. It comes on top of base pay and is usually based on an employee's performance.
The cuts to the pay of senior DBS executives comes despite the bank posting annual record earnings, with its 2023 net profit rising by 26% to S$10.3bn.
Like many other banks around the world, DBS has benefited from higher interest rates as central banks have kept the cost of borrowing up as they tried to curb rising prices.
The company's shares were trading around 2.7% higher after the earnings announcement on Wednesday morning.
Mr Gupta has been the chief executive of DBS since November 2009.
Under his leadership the firm has grown its businesses in India, Taiwan, and mainland China.
It has also expanded its wealth management business, which is now one of the biggest in Asia.

In an interview with Fox News, he said the tariffs could be in excess of 60%.
""We have to do it,"" said Mr Trump
Currently the frontrunner for the Republican party, Mr Trump is facing a number of criminal charges including attempting to overturn the 2020 election results, which he has denied.
He has long accused China of unfair trading practices and intellectual property theft.
""You know, obviously I'm not looking to hurt China. I want to get along with China. I think it's great. But they've really taken advantage of our country,"" he said.
During his presidency, Mr Trump triggered a bitter trade war between the world's two largest economies as he imposed tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods.
The Trump administration first began imposing levies aimed at curbing Chinese imports in 2018. The policy escalated to duties on goods ranging from seafood to chemicals later that year.
Beijing responded with tariffs on US imports including soybeans, wheat and poultry.
Mr Trump's latest comments go further than his previous remarks about introducing a universal 10% tariff on all imports into the US.
Current US President Joe Biden's administration has largely kept the tariffs in place, despite criticism that they have helped to push up prices and made the country less competitive.
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said last month that Mr Trump's plan to raise tariffs would raise the costs of a ""variety of goods"" for American businesses and consumers.
The US has been China's biggest export market for over two decades.
However, curbing US-China economic ties is gaining support from some Republican and Democrat lawmakers. A recent House committee report recommended higher tariffs on imports from China and restrictions on Chinese investments in the US.

2024-03-06T00:02:57.000Z,Can the Panama Canal save itself?,BBC News,"The most famous waterway in the Americas is running dry.
Unlike the Suez Canal, the Panama Canal is fed by a freshwater lake, Lake Gatún, and its water level is falling critically low.
After a choppy boat ride across Lake Gatún, Nelson Guerra, the Panama Canal Authority's hydrologist, points toward a rusted ruler beneath a tower on the western end of the water.
""The level, as you see on the rulers, is 81.20ft,"" he says. ""The level should be five feet more than now.""
On the return journey, the boat passes old tree stumps sticking out of the water. They were never fully cut down during the original construction of the lake. Normally, only a few would be visible at this time of year. But half way through the dry season, there's a forest of them.
The Panama Canal is reliant on rainwater, which is in short supply.
A lack of rain and the El Nino weather phenomenon have contributed to the second driest year in the canal's 110-year history.
Last October was the driest month since records began. The canal region saw 41% less rainfall than normal, and the drought threatens to continue disrupting the $270bn (£213bn) worth of cargo that flows through the Atlantic-Pacific shortcut annually.
They've had to introduce water-saving measures, which has meant fewer ships can pass through the canal each day. This is because water from the lake is required to operate the canal's locks.
The number of vessels has been slashed from an average of 36 to 24. Each ship is also carrying less cargo now because of weight restrictions.
The slowdown spells trouble for global trade.
In normal times about 5% of global maritime trade uses the Atlantic-Pacific shortcut, and 40% of US container traffic. If the route runs dry, shippers will be forced to find alternatives - lengthening journey times and pushing up costs.
And the lack of water is not just a problem for global trade. The Panama Canal Authority also supplies drinking water for half of the country's population, including the residents of the capital, Panama City.
But those who run the canal are taking steps to ensure it remains viable for another century, and beyond.
The Panama Canal Authority's first ever chief sustainability officer, Ilya Espino de Marotta, says they are working on finding solutions to ensure the canal does not run out of water.
""We don't want this to be a recurrent issue. We don't want to drop transits or tonnage,"" she says.
The authority has been busy developing a plan to invest $8.5bn in sustainability projects over the next five years that it hopes can help the vaunted waterway survive, even as changes rock the planet.
Addressing the changing climate, Ilya Espino de Marotta says: ""Panama is a very rainy country… but we see there's a [reduced rainfall] pattern coming that is impacting everywhere. So we definitely need to prepare for the future.""
One obvious measure involves water conservation.
The Panama Canal works by transiting boats through a series of above-sea-level locks fed by Lake Gatún and the smaller Lake Alajuela.
Each ship that passes through the locks uses around 50 million gallons of water, and a handful of new locks built in 2016 - the larger Neo-Panamax locks - save 60% of that water.
However, the older Panamax locks remain in operation, and overhauling them would be a major project. In the meantime, the canal authority has found ways to reuse water from one lock chamber to another, so called cross-filling, saving the equivalent of six daily crossings.
The authority is also considering building reservoirs, its first major project since it completed the new set of locks in 2016.
To save more water in rainy months and increase supply in drier times, it wants to dam up the nearby Indio River, and pipe the fresh water into Lake Gatún, the canal's main reservoir. The plan would increase vessel traffic by 12 to 15 a day.
Moving forward won't be easy though. The project doesn't have congressional approval yet, and construction will take several years to complete.
Another option is to build desalination plants. The lack of rain has increased the salinity of the lakes and rivers, a challenge that has to be managed given it's the country's biggest source of potable water. But that option is costly and removing salt from seawater requires a huge amount of energy.
Even seeding clouds in the hopes of creating more rain isn't off the table. The process of implanting large salt particles into clouds to boost rainfall sounds futuristic, but has been around since the 1940s.
A solution needs to be found lest global trade, which has become more unstable this year, gets even more so. Trade volumes through the Panama Canal have fallen 49% compared to its peak.
José Cervantes, a general manager at the Panama branch of shipping company Agunsa, says their daily operations have been hit. Shipments of two million tons of goods from textiles to food have been delayed because of the disruptions at the Panama Canal.
He says the problem is that there are no other good shortcuts.
Some ships carrying cargo from Asia were rerouted through the Suez Canal, before the current Red Sea crisis. With that option less secure, there's been an increase in demand for rail and road transport across Panama.
But José Cervantes says all that unloading and reloading of cargo from ships onto trains and trucks is pushing up costs. ""And those costs are usually passed onto the consumer,"" he says.
If rains arrive in May as expected, the canal plans to increase the number of ships that can pass through its locks, but that is only a short term solution.
Changing rainfall patterns, serve as a reminder of the major impact climate change could have on global trade and on the long term future of the Panama Canal.

The US celebrity, who has been on the firm's board since 2015, said she would not stand for re-election at its next shareholder meeting in May.
Ms Winfrey recently revealed that she used weight-loss drugs as a ""maintenance tool.""
Shares in WeightWatchers International fell by 27% in extended New York trade.
Ms Winfrey said in a statement that she would continue to work with WeightWatchers ""in elevating the conversation around recognizing obesity as a chronic condition.""
The influential talk show host and businesswoman also said she will donate all her shares in the firm to the National Museum of African American History and Culture.
Ms Winfrey is one of the biggest shareholders in WeightWatchers with a stake of around 10%.
When Ms Winfrey started working with the company almost a decade ago, she joined the WeightWatchers programme and shared her experiences with other members. She had previously spoken publicly about her battles with weight.
Her decision to leave the board comes as the company contends with a major shift in the weight-loss industry after the launch of anti-obesity drugs such as Wegovy and Saxenda.
Also on Tuesday, WeightWatchers published its latest financial figures, which showed a net loss of $88.1m (£69.6m) for the last three months of 2023, more than twice as much as the same period the previous year.
In March 2023, the company announced it would buy digital health company Sequence ""as a natural step"" given ""the advancements in chronic weight management medications.""
Sequence describes itself as a weight loss programme, which offers a suite of services to its subscribers. As well as advice from fitness coaches and dietitians, it is also able to prescribe drugs such as Ozempic and Wegovy.
WeightWatchers boss Sima Sistani said the $132m deal would allow members to benefit from both its approach to ""nutrition and behaviour-change"" as well as prescription medications.

2024-02-05T05:31:07.000Z,One million electric cars sold in the UK since 2002,BBC News,"The UK registered its one millionth electric car last month, despite a big drop in sales, new figures suggest.
New EV registrations by private buyers fell by a quarter in January, threatening to undermine the UK's net zero promises.
Overall new car sales to private customers fell by 16% in the same period, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said.
The figures have sparked more calls for tax cuts to boost uptake among buyers.
More than 20,000 battery electric cars (BEVs) were registered in January, up by a fifth year on year and helped by generous tax incentives for company car users. It means that since 2002, one million of these cars have reached the road.
Fleet buyers - companies purchasing more than 25 units in one go - have been entirely behind the increase, with demand for BEVs growing by more than 40%.
Electric cars accounted for 14.7% of all new vehicles sold in the UK in January. Although that was an increase over the same month the year before, it was still well below the market share of 16.5% achieved for the whole of 2023.
The lack of sales to private buyers has prompted calls from the SMMT for the government to halve VAT on electric vehicles, in order to boost demand.
""It's taken just over 20 years to reach our million EV milestone - but with the right policies, we can double down on that success in just another two,"" SMMT boss Mike Hawes said.
""Manufacturers have been asked to supply the vehicles, we now ask government to help consumers buy the vehicles on which net zero depends,"" he added.
EVs have lower running costs than petrol and diesel vehicles, but the upfront price is around 30-40% higher, according to the motoring organisation.
Currently those buying an EV in the UK through a business, a company car or salary sacrifice scheme can benefit from generous tax incentives. Grants for individuals were phased out by the government in 2022.
Last year, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak confirmed a ban on new petrol and diesel car sales was being pushed back five years from 2030 to 2035.
The announcement was met with a mixed response from carmakers, many of whom have begun investing heavily in electric vehicle production.
Despite the delay in the ban, firms will still be forced to meet strict quotas for selling electric cars from January, ensuring that more than one in five cars sold are zero emission models. If not, they will face heavy fines. The target will go up each year until 2030.
According to the latest SMMT figures, the overall new car market grew in January, pushed by a large increase in fleet sales, which were up by a third.
This was despite a fall in overall registrations of new private cars last month, which fell by 16%.
Fleet sales accounted for more than six in 10 new cars registered in the month, up from just over half last year.

2024-02-15T12:55:21.000Z,British Gas sees profits increase 10-fold,BBC News,"British Gas has announced its profits for 2023 increased 10-fold to £750m.
The supplier said the jump from £72m in 2022 was due to regulator Ofgem allowing it to recover losses of £500m it racked up in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
While oil and gas firms made record profits when energy prices spiked, suppliers that took on the customers of bust retailers made hefty losses.
Centrica, British Gas's parent company, said its profits fell by 17% to £2.8bn.
The energy giant, which extracts and generates fossil fuels, followed BP and Shell in posting reduced, albeit still large, profits for 2023 due to oil and gas prices falling back on the levels seen in 2022.
Millions of households have been hit by higher electricity and gas bills in recent years. Energy has also been the main driver in the rising cost of living in the UK.
Centrica said its retail business, British Gas, which has 7.5 million customers, made £750m in profits as a result of being allowed by Ofgem, the energy regulator, to claw back £500m in losses.
This was due to the energy price cap, set by regulator Ofgem, allowing energy providers to take a bigger slice of profits in the first half of 2023, to compensate them for debts on bills that they cannot recover from customers.
It added it did not expect a ""repeat"" of the benefit in the future.
The losses were incurred due to British Gas, along with several other suppliers, taking on customers and honouring existing contracts when dozens of small energy providers went bust in 2021 when gas prices surged and made price promises to customers undeliverable.
Ofgem confirmed it ""allowed"" companies to recover ""some of the losses they incurred during the energy crisis"".
""This one-off adjustment is reflected in the first half of the year and will therefore show in the profits for the whole year and this is why most suppliers are showing higher than usual profits for this period,"" a spokesperson said.
""For the second half of the year profits have returned to more normal levels allowed for under the price cap. And we would expect them to remain at such levels moving forward.""
British Gas was at the centre of a scandal last year when it emerged debt agents working for the energy supplier had broken into vulnerable people's homes to force-fit prepayment meters.
Aarin Chiekrie, equity analyst at investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown, said British Gas's services arm, which includes things such as boiler installations, had been ""in a sticky spot in recent years, plagued by scandals and poor customer service levels"".
He said customer numbers had fallen by 8% in 2023 as cost-of-living pressures drove customers to search among providers to find the cheapest deals.
But he added the company had ""invested heavily in improving its service levels, and it's beginning to show through lower job rescheduling rates and complaints"".
Chris O'Shea, chief executive of Centrica, said the company had ""done a lot we can be proud of in 2023"", adding it had paid more than £1bn in tax.
He renewed calls for a ""social tariff"" to enable people on lower incomes to pay less for their gas and electricity.
""The poorest in society are really struggling but it's not just the energy. It's energy, it's rent, it's mortgages, it's food and all manner of costs,"" he said on a call on Thursday.
""What I'm focused on is how do we fix this in energy and that's why we need a social tariff, that's why we need the standing charge to disappear.""

2024-03-07T18:01:13.000Z,Labour and Tories accused of silence over cuts,BBC News,"The Conservatives and Labour have been accused of a ""conspiracy of silence"" over the scale of spending cuts or tax rises by an influential think tank.
Tough decisions would need to be made following the next election, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said.
Chancellor Jeremy Hunt told the BBC it would be ""challenging"" to live within current spending restrictions.
Labour says it will have to make future savings to public spending to fund some of its policies if it wins power.
The state of the economy is under intense focus in the run-up to a general election that must be called before next January.
In Wednesday's Budget, the chancellor cut National Insurance by 2p and increased child benefit salary thresholds, while introducing a new vaping levy and abolishing non-dom tax status.
Scrapping non-dom status had been a Labour Party policy and leader Sir Keir Starmer described the decision by the Conservatives to use it in their Budget as ""humiliating"".
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak refused to be drawn on the date of the general election.
He told BBC Radio Leeds ""nothing has changed"" since when he said his working assumption was for the public to go to the polls in the second half of this year.
""I was very clear about this at the beginning of the year about my working assumption for the election being in the second half of the year - nothing has changed since then,"" he said.
Mr Sunak also said the focus on the election date was coming from the Labour party to ""distract from the fact that actually they don't want talk about the substance"".
The IFS said the tax cuts announced in the Budget would not make up for the impact of tax increases and rising prices.
It said households would be worse off at the election than they were at the start of this parliament.
Under the current government's self-imposed fiscal rules, debt must be falling as a proportion of the size of the economy in five years' time.
IFS director Paul Johnson said that debt as a proportion of the size of the economy was at its highest level in 70 years and ""is showing no signs of falling"".
He added that the next parliament could ""well prove to be the most difficult of any in 80 years for a chancellor wanting to bring debt down"".
Mr Johnson said both Conservatives and Labour were joining in ""a conspiracy of silence in not acknowledging the scale of the choices and trade-offs that will face us after the election"" which included ""eye-wateringly tough choices"" on public service spending to stabilise debt as a fraction of national income.
In the Budget, Mr Hunt said he would keep the planned increase in day-to-day government spending at 1% above inflation every year until 2029.
However, as some departments like health and schools have protected budgets, that means others such as justice and local government could see significant cuts.
Unprotected departments could face day-to-day cuts of up to £20bn, Mr Johnson warned.
The chancellor said the lack of detail was because plans are decided and reliant on a government spending review which, he disclosed on Wednesday, will not be done until after the general election. The last spending review was in 2021.
Mr Hunt told the BBC: ""We know it's going to be challenging to live within a tight spending envelope and we want to do it without affecting the services the public value.""
Earlier this year, Richard Hughes, the head of the independent government economic forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), said it would be ""generous"" to call the spending plans a ""work of fiction"" given the lack of detail in them.
Speaking to the BBC on Thursday, Mr Hughes said while the OBR had lots detail on the government's tax plans, it had much less about spending plans for public services which accounts for two-thirds of the deficit reduction that Mr Hunt needs to deliver over the next five years to meet his debt targets.
""They've got a very constrained envelope for that spending, no real growth per person on public services,"" he told the Today programme.
""But what we don't know is, what does that mean for the NHS? What does it mean for transport? What does it mean for education? We don't have that detail on the spending side.""
Mr Hunt has defended the squeeze on public spending as realistic if schools, hospitals and the police increased productivity by deploying automation, artificial intelligence and drones.
Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves has said Labour now intends to pay for its NHS and school breakfast plans through future savings to public spending if it wins power.
Labour had intended to use money raised from scrapping the non-dom tax regime, but Mr Hunt is now using this to help fund the cut to National Insurance.
Ms Reeves admitted it will force her to change her own plans. ""But we will find that money, because it is a national priority, and it is a Labour priority,"" she told the BBC.
Separate analysis from the Resolution Foundation, a think tank which focuses on low and middle earners, said that Wednesday's Budget would mean a net tax cut of £9bn is taking effect this year.
However, that was dwarfed by an estimated £27bn of tax rises that came into effect last year - and a further £19bn coming in after the election.
The foundation said that while more than three-quarters of the personal tax cuts announced in the Budget go to the richest half of households, there is a different picture when all the tax and benefit policies announced in this parliament - starting in 2019 - are analysed.
""Middle earners have come out on top, while taxpayers earning below £26,000 or over £60,000 will lose out. The biggest group of losers are pensioners, who face an £8bn collective hit,"" said Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation.
He added that policy changes seen in the current parliament ""reinforces the sense that the government has reversed course from the approach that dominated during the 2010s"".
""Back then, support was focused on pensioners and takeaways on poorer, younger households. This time it is those aged over 65 and on the highest incomes who are set to lose most.""
The Resolution Foundation also said that the UK is heading for nearly 20 years of lost pay growth as, after taking account of rising prices, the average wage will not regain its 2008 level until 2026.
It said that if pay had continued to grow at the same pace seen before the 2008 financial crisis, the average worker in 2023 would have been around £14,000 better off.

The retailer said roles would be lost at its contact centre in Cheshire, in-store bakeries, and some local fulfilment centres.
Some staff will be redeployed, with alternative roles found ""where possible"".
The savings will be invested back into the business, the retailer added.
Announcing the news, Sainsbury's said ""the vast majority"" of jobs at its Widnes call centre would be transferred to its service partner, Careline services. It described it as ""a major employer"" and said it offered a ""range of career opportunities"".
The supermarket said it had begun moving to a more efficient way of baking goods in-store, and had outlined plans to move more stores to the model.
""As a result, the supermarket will be conducting a consultancy process with bakers in these stores,"" the retailer continued.
Sainsbury's said it had reassured colleagues that it would find alternative roles for them where possible, as it would ""for any colleague affected by changes proposed"".
Jobs are also being cut from the retailer's merchandise distribution network, with Sainsbury's confirming more investment in technology and innovation, meaning the company will need fewer local fulfilment centres.
Sainsbury's chief executive Simon Roberts summed up the changes as the next part of its strategy to deliver value and good service to customers, while making ""difficult but necessary decisions"".
""I know today's news is unsettling for affected colleagues and we will do everything we can to support them,"" he added.

2024-02-21T11:15:22.000Z,King Charles banknotes to enter circulation in June,BBC News,"New banknotes featuring the image of King Charles will enter circulation on 5 June, the Bank of England has announced.
The King's portrait will be the only change to existing designs of £5, £10, £20 and £50 notes, and new notes will replace damaged or worn older ones.
Coins featuring the King are already found in people's change but banknotes required lots of preparation.
Shoppers can and will still be able to use Queen Elizabeth II banknotes.
The reverse side of current polymer Bank of England banknotes, which in ascending order feature Sir Winston Churchill, Jane Austen, JMW Turner and Alan Turing, will be unchanged.
Low-serial numbered notes on new issues are of huge interest to collectors. They will be sold during the summer at auctioneers Spink & Son.
In addition to the auctions, members of the public will be able to enter a ballot to purchase a set of notes. The money raised will be donated to charity.
They will also be able to exchange a limited value of current or old series notes for new King Charles notes, through the Bank of England, for a short time from 5 June.
In April last year, the BBC was given exclusive access to the highly-secure site where notes are being produced for the Bank of England.
However, machines such as self-service tills needed time to recognise the new image which is why it has taken so long for them to enter circulation.
The Queen Elizabeth notes that are already in circulation - some 4.7 billion of them, worth £82bn - can still be used in the shops, even after the new notes enter circulation. The King Charles notes will only replace them when they are no longer fit for use, or when there is any increased demand.
The first Bank of England note to feature Queen Elizabeth II's portrait was a £1 note issued in 1960.
The Royal household has given guidance encouraging such a move, rather than a wholesale switch, in order to minimise the environmental and financial impact of the change.
This month, King Charles's preferred crown is replacing Queen Elizabeth II's favoured symbol on the government's website, marking his role of the head of state.

2024-03-01T22:54:19.000Z,Boeing in takeover talks for Spirit Aerosystems,BBC News,"Boeing is in talks to take over Spirit Aerosystems, the supplier that has been involved in many of its recent manufacturing issues.
The company, a major global air parts supplier, was spun out of Boeing in 2005 as part of a cost-cutting drive.
It continues to rely on Boeing for more than two-thirds of its business.
Boeing has been under pressure over its manufacturing pipeline after a piece of one of its planes blew off in mid-air in January.
The US government's review of the blowout found that bolts meant to fasten the panel had been removed at Boeing's factory in Washington, apparently to fix damaged rivets, and had never been re-installed.
The piece had been made by Spirit, before being sent to Boeing for final assembly.
This week, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which has been examining Boeing since the incident, gave Boeing 90 days to develop a ""comprehensive action plan"" for improving its safety management systems.
Boeing has already been working closely with Spirit to address a spate of quality issues, which have caused delays to plane deliveries and led to the appointment of a new chief executive at Spirit last year.
In a statement on Friday to Reuters news agency, Boeing said: ""We believe that the reintegration of Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems' manufacturing operations would further strengthen aviation safety, improve quality and serve the interests of our customers, employees, and shareholders.""
Following reports of takeover talks, shares in Spirit jumped by more than 10% on Friday, giving it a market value of more than $3.7bn.
But shares in Boeing slid more than 1% after the discussions were first reported in the Wall Street Journal.
Spirit, which the Journal said was also considering a sale of its Northern Irish unit to Airbus, did not respond to the BBC's request for comment.
Spirit employs more than 20,600 people around the world, including about 3,400 in Belfast and 1,120 in Prestwick.

2024-02-13T03:51:49.000Z,AI: UK chip designer Arm sees shares almost double,BBC News,"UK chip designer Arm Holdings has seen its stock market value almost double in less than a week as investors bet on the artificial intelligence (AI) boom.
The Cambridge-based company reported financial results last Wednesday that showed demand for AI-related technology is boosting its sales.
Chips designed by Arm already power almost every smartphone in the world.
The firm was taken private by Japan's SoftBank in 2016 and it returned to the stock market last September.
Arm's shares have soared since its earnings announcement last week and are now up by more than 98%.
It comes as chipmaker Nvidia has seen its shares more than triple in value in the last year on soaring demand for its AI chips.
The AI boom has helped Nvidia become one of the most valuable publicly-traded companies in the world, with a stock market valuation of around $1.8 trillion (£1.4 trillion).
It has also made it the fifth publicly traded US company to join the so-called ""Trillion-dollar club"", along with technology giants Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon.
Arm's technology is not directly used for AI work, but chip makers like Nvidia are choosing it for central processing units (CPUs) that complement their AI-specific chips.
Aside from Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), Arm's customers also include well-known consumer brands like Apple.
Demand for Arm-designed chips is also growing in the car making industry thanks to the development of self-driving technology.
Arm was founded in 1990 by a group chip designers in the university city of Cambridge.
It was bought by SoftBank in 2016 for $32bn. Four years later, the Japanese conglomerate announced that it planned to sell Arm to Nvidia.
However, in April 2022 SoftBank shelved the deal after facing objections from regulators around the world and said it would instead sell shares in Arm on the Nasdaq stock exchange in New York.
The jump in Arm's shares is welcome news for SoftBank, as it has been hit by losses due to the falling valuations of  some of its investments, including struggling office space firm WeWork.
SoftBank, which still holds a roughly 90% stake in Arm, has seen its own shares gain almost 30% in the past week.

2024-03-13T03:57:30.000Z,AI: Google restricts Gemini chatbot election answers,BBC News,"Google has confirmed it is restricting the types of election-related questions users can ask its Artificial Intelligence (AI) chatbot Gemini.
In a blog post, it said the policy had been rolled out in India, which will hold elections starting in April.
It comes as the firm aims to avoid more controversy over AI technology.
Gemini is essentially Google's version of the viral chatbot ChatGPT. It can answer questions in text form, and it can also generate pictures.
A spokesperson for Google told the BBC that the latest move was part of plans announced last year around its approach to elections.
""As we shared last December, in preparation for the many elections happening around the world in 2024 and out of an abundance of caution, we're restricting the types of election-related queries for which Gemini will return responses,"" they said.
Elections are due to be held in countries around the world this year including the US, UK and South Africa.
When the BBC asked Gemini questions about those elections it responded each time with: ""I'm still learning how to answer this question. In the meantime, try Google Search.""
However, when a series of follow-up questions about Indian politics was put to Gemini it did supply more detailed responses about the country's major parties.
Developments in generative AI have raised concerns about misinformation and prompted governments around the world to move to regulate the technology.
In recent weeks India has told technology companies that they need approval before releasing AI tools that are ""unreliable"" or being trialled.
In February, Google apologised after its recently launched AI image generator created an image of the US Founding Fathers which inaccurately included a black man.
Gemini also generated German soldiers from World War Two, incorrectly featuring a black man and Asian woman.
It also immediately ""paused"" the tool, writing in a blog post that it was ""missing the mark"".

That topped the previous record closing high of 38,915.87 set on 29 December 1989, the last day of trading that decade.
Asian technology shares were boosted after US chip giant Nvidia revealed strong earnings, driven by demand for its artificial intelligence processors.
Global investors are returning to the benchmark index thanks to strong company earnings, even as the country's economy has fallen into a recession.
The weakness of the Japanese currency has also helped to boost share prices of Japan's exporters as it makes their products cheaper in overseas markets.
The Nikkei 225 hit its previous record high after years of soaring stock and property prices.
Less than three years after that peak the benchmark index had lost almost 60% of its value as the Japanese economy was engulfed in an economic crisis.
Since then the Japan has struggled with little or no economic growth and falling prices, known as deflation.
Deflation is bad for an economy as persistent price declines mean that consumers tend to hold off from buying big ticket items due to the expectation that they will be cheaper in the future.
Last week, official figures showed that the Japanese economy had unexpectedly slipped into recession in the last three months of 2023.
The country's gross domestic product (GDP) contracted by a worse-than-expected 0.4% in the last three months of 2023, compared to a year earlier.
It came after the economy shrank by 3.3% in the previous quarter.
The figures from Japan's Cabinet Office also indicate that the country has lost its position as the world's third-largest economy to Germany.
The latest figures were the first reading of Japan's economic growth for the period and could still be revised.
Two quarters in a row of economic contraction are typically considered the definition of a technical recession.

During the same period China's Huawei saw its sales jump by 64% in its home market, the report says.
Apple and Huawei did not immediately respond to requests for comment from the BBC.
Aside from a resurgence of Huawei sales at the more expensive end of the Chinese phone market, Apple was also ""squeezed in the middle on aggressive pricing from the likes of Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi,"" Counterpoint Research's Mengmeng Zhang wrote.
China, which is one of Apple's biggest markets, also saw overall smartphone sales shrink by 7% in the same period, the report said.
Huawei struggled for years due to US sanctions but its sales surged after releasing its Mate 60 series of 5G smartphones in August.
It came as a major surprise as the Chinese firm was cut off from key chips and technology required for 5G mobile internet.
Honor, which is the smartphone brand spun off from Huawei in 2020, was the only other top-five brand to see sales increase in China during the period, according to the report.
Sales of Vivo, Xiaomi and Oppo also fell in the first six weeks of the year, Counterpoint said.
Its report also said Apple's share of the Chinese smartphone market dropped to 15.7% from 19% last year, putting it in fourth place as it fell from the number two spot.
Meanwhile, Huawei rose to second place as its market share grew to 16.5% from 9.4% a year earlier.
Despite its sales falling by 15% over the last year, Vivo remained China's top-selling smartphone maker, Counterpoint said.
Apple started offering discounts on its official sites in China last month before subsidising certain iPhone models through its flagship stores on Alibaba's marketplace platform Tmall last week.
A slowdown in demand in China could affect Apple's revenue which already disappointed investors when the firm released its earnings last month.
The firm said sales in China were $20.82bn (£16.4bn) in the last three months of 2023, down from $23.9bn in the previous year.

2024-03-12T14:45:42.000Z,US inflation edges up as Fed debates interest rate cuts,BBC News,"The inflation rate in the US picked up in February, as prices for petrol and housing pushed higher.
The annual rate, which measures the pace of price increases, was 3.2% in February, up from 3.1% in January, the Labor Department said.
Airfare, car insurance and clothing were among the items driving the increase over the month.
Grocery prices, which have jumped in recent years, fuelling public discontent, were unchanged.
The monthly report comes during a critical presidential election year and as the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, is debating the next step in its fight to rein in prices.
Inflation has slowed significantly since the Fed started hiking borrowing costs sharply in 2022 and the bank is expected to start reversing course and cutting interest rates sometime this year.
But calls for the first cut to come as soon as March have been revised as recent inflation readings show progress stalling, with many now expecting its first move in June or later.
Analysts said the figures were affected by seasonal price adjustments tied to the start of the year, but that the overall report was likely to reinforce the Fed's determination to remain cautious.
""This print is just about enough to keep rate cut expectations for June stable - but another print like this next month would push the first cut into the second half of the year, putting the soft landing narrative in question,"" said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management.
The US economy has so far held up better than expected in the face of inflation and higher borrowing costs, but persistent price rises have hampered President Joe Biden's ability to sell his policies to voters and could pose risks to the economy in the months ahead.
The Labor Department said petrol prices rose by 3.8% between January and February, while airline fares rose 3.6%.
Grocery prices showed little change over the month, as higher prices for items such as cereal, bread and eggs were offset by lower meat and fresh fruit costs.
Overall, grocery prices were 1% higher than a year earlier.
Housing costs rose 0.4% over the month and 5.7% from February 2023.
Housing plays a major role in US inflation calculations, amounting to roughly a third of the consumer price index.
The department's inflation measure takes into account both rental rates and ""owners' equivalent"" rent, an estimate of what a homeowner would have to pay to rent their own property.
If housing costs are excluded, the inflation rate in the US is far lower than the official rate - with prices up about 1.8% compared with February 2023.
Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at consultancy firm RSM, who last year had predicted that housing costs would remain an inflation driver, said he now saw that changing in the months ahead.
""If you're looking at the US from externally, you should be able to begin to make some judgment that the US is rapidly approaching the point at which we can say we've obtained price stability,"" he said.
The latest report, Mr Brusuelas said, suggested ""a lot of noise and not the development of a new trend"".
But he added, ""We're not quite there yet to the point where the Fed's ready to declare the all-clear"".

2024-03-12T14:26:22.000Z,More than a fifth of UK adults not looking for work,BBC News,"More than a fifth of working-age adults in the UK are deemed not to be actively looking for work, figures suggest.
The UK's economic inactivity rate was 21.8% between November and January, marginally higher than a year earlier.
It means 9.2 million people aged between 16 and 64 in the UK are not in work nor looking for a job. The total figure is more than 700,000 higher than before the coronavirus pandemic.
Concerns have been raised over worker shortages affecting the UK economy.
The health of the UK economy is in the spotlight with the general election set to be called in the coming months and both major political parties pledging to boost growth.
The UK fell into recession at the end of last year when the economy shrank for two consecutive three-month periods, but latest official statistics showed the level of unemployment remained steady. The figure also showed that wage rises slowed again, although pay is still outpacing inflation.
However, the number of people not employed or actively looking for work has remained at a persistently high level in recent years since it first surged during the pandemic.
Long-term illness has been cited as the main reason for about a third of the working-age inactive population not being in the labour force.
But other groups placed in the bracket - defined differently to unemployment - by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) include students, people who look after family or a home, people with disabilities, and early retired and discouraged workers.
More women still tend to be classed as economically inactive compared to men, but the gap has narrowed since records began in the early 1970s, largely due to more women entering the workforce.
The ONS said its latest figures suggested the number of people inactive due to being sick fell in recent months, but remained higher than estimates a year ago.
It added there had been an increase in people aged 16 to 34 becoming economically inactive, but that the number aged 35 to 64 had fallen. A recent report suggested people in their early 20s were more likely to be not working due to ill health than those in their early 40s, with cases of poor mental health believed to be on the rise.
Workforce shortages have led to Chancellor Jeremy Hunt setting out a series of measures, most recently in his Budget last week, aimed at encouraging people to find work, or increase hours.
Policies outlined include reducing the starting rate for National Insurance Contributions from 10% to 8% for 27 million workers from 6 April, along with an extension of free childcare services for working parents.
But business groups said more needed to be done to get more people into work amid concerns over the UK's long-term weak economic growth.
Neil Carberry, chief executive of the Recruitment and Employment Confederation, added that cutting NI rates was the ""right call"", but would not be a ""silver bullet to encourage enough people to work"".
""To get inactivity down government needs to look at childcare, transport and address NHS waiting lists,"" he said. ""The Budget didn't add up to the industrial and workforce strategy we really need despite the chancellor's obvious interest in workforce matters.""
Alexandra Hall-Chen, principal policy adviser for employment at the Institute of Directors, said many companies were ""still struggling to access the skills they need"".
""A future government should place tackling skills shortages and increasing labour force participation at the centre of its growth plan,"" she added.
Chris Bingham, chief executive of energy supplier Greenarc Ltd in West Yorkshire, said businesses need to think about how to encourage people into the workforce, and ""give them more of what they want"", especially to younger employees.
He said that people aged 16 to 24 had their education disrupted by the pandemic. ""They're coming into a workforce and business community that itself is still struggling to understand how we're all going to work post-Covid,"" he told the BBC's Today programme.
""I think there's a clear disconnect between the employer and young employees,"" he added, arguing that any future government needed to put a ""bigger focus on apprenticeships and workplace engagement as opposed to a blanket university route"".
Work and Pensions Secretary Mel Stride told the BBC that the UK had a ""very healthy"" labour market and that the government's ""plan is very much baring down on economic inactivity"", adding that the UK had a lower inactivity rate than the US, France and Italy,
The government's official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which has estimated that policies on childcare expansion, welfare reform, and personal tax cuts are predicted to increase the UK's labour supply by more than 300,000.
But the OBR has said that personal tax thresholds being frozen ""will also weigh on work incentives"", meaning the increase would be closer to 200,000.
Richard Hughes, chair of the OBR, told a committee of MPs on Tuesday that people being out of the workforce for health reasons ""is now the single largest reason"", and added it was ""worrying"" for economy.

Liz Kendall, Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary, said millions of people were ""locked out of work"" due to long-term sickness on the ""Tories' watch"".
She said Labour would cut NHS waiting lists as part of a plan to get more people working.

2024-03-05T03:24:59.000Z,"North Korea hacked South Korea chip equipment makers, Seoul says",BBC News,"North Korean hackers have broken into South Korean chip equipment makers, according to South Korea's spy agency.
Pyongyang is trying to make semiconductors for its weapons programmes, the National Intelligence Service (NIS) says.
It comes a month after President Yoon Suk Yeol warned North Korea may stage provocations such as cyber attacks to interfere with upcoming elections.
Last year, North Korea hacked into the emails of an aide to President Yoon.
""We believe that North Korea might possibly be preparing to produce its own semiconductors in the face of difficulties in procuring them due to sanctions,"" the NIS said in a statement.
It added that Pyongyang's efforts could be driven by the need to have chips for its weapons programmes, including satellites and missiles.
The NIS believes North Korea penetrated the servers of two chip equipment companies in December and February, stealing product designs and photographs of their facilities.
It also warned other companies in the chip making industry to take precautions against cyber attacks.
However, the spy agency did not name the firms affected and or suggest that North Korea was able to obtain anything of value.
The NIS said South Korea's companies had been a key target of North Korean hackers since late last year.
It believes hackers employed a technique called ""living off the land,"" which minimises malicious codes and uses existing, legitimate tools installed within servers, making it difficult to detect with security software.
Last month, President Yoon's office said that the breach of an aide's email account was caused by a violation of security regulations and that its official system had not been hacked.
Pyongyang has always denied involvement in cyber-crimes but Seoul has blamed North Korean hackers for stealing large sums of money, often in cryptocurrency, to fund the regime and its nuclear weapons programme.
North Korea is estimated to have stolen as much as $3bn (£2.36bn) since 2016.
It is also thought to carry out hacks with the purpose of stealing state secrets, including details of advanced weapons technology.
The country, which is subject to extreme international sanctions, is becoming increasingly more sophisticated in the way it carries out cyber attacks.

2024-02-26T09:56:58.000Z,Royal Mail: What’s gone wrong at the company?,BBC News,"Jasmine Moulton's children have a series of complex medical conditions. On some days five-year-old Harper's skin allergies flare up so badly, her body has to be wrapped in bandages. Three-year-old Joshua has problems with breathing and swallowing. Both need regular hospital check-ups.
NHS Trusts contact Jasmine about medical appointments via letter. But in recent months these letters have either been late or don't arrive at all.
At the beginning of January this year, Jasmine received a call from the hospital to inform her that not only had both her children missed appointments, Joshua had missed a surgery which should have taken place in late December.
""And I was like, 'pardon?' And I was in a bit of shock. I explained that we hadn't had any post come through. She sounded shocked,"" Jasmine says.
As Jasmine talks, Joshua, who has a chest infection, lies on the sofa next to her. He coughs and wheezes. They had hoped the operation that he missed might have helped with his swallowing.
""It's just so frustrating. On top of being a mum to two children with..."" Jasmine can't finish her sentence, she starts to cry. She is clearly exhausted.
""It stresses me out every day because I just think, how many other appointments have we missed? And just not knowing when we're going to be able to move on. And seeing him suffering.""
Royal Mail says it is ""not acceptable"" that the NHS letters didn't arrive and apologised to the family.
The company's director of corporate affairs, Jenny Hall, said: ""I've got young children myself and I know that must have been hugely stressful.""
For more on this story, watch Panorama on BBC One at 20:00 GMT on Monday, 26 February and on BBC iPlayer afterwards.
Reporter Zoe Conway speaks to Royal Mail insiders about problems facing the company and hears from its management about how proposed changes may help stave off multi-million-pound losses.
Four miles from Jasmine's home in Cheshire is Royal Mail's Winsford delivery office. On a weekday morning in early February, a steady stream of people turned up to collect undelivered letters.
One woman, who is recovering from cancer, was worried she had missed an NHS letter: ""I'm expecting an appointment next month. If I miss it, it could be life threatening.""
Another woman said she had collected a birthday card from her grandmother who had been upset to hear that it had failed to arrive on time. ""She lives in Wales, I don't see her very often,"" she said.
Royal Mail says that it will investigate what has been going on at the Winsford delivery office as ""a priority"".
But it is not just in Cheshire that Royal Mail is struggling to deliver. Second class letters, which now cost 75p, should arrive within three working days. First class letters, which cost £1.25, should arrive the next working day. Ten years ago, 92% of first class post arrived on time. By the end of last year it was down to 74%, according to the regulator Ofcom.
In some places, the picture is even worse. In 17 postcodes between June and September 2023, more than a third of all first class post was late. In November Ofcom fined Royal Mail £5.6m for failing to meet its targets.
Under what is called the Universal Service Obligation, Royal Mail is required by law to deliver letters six days a week and parcels five days a week to every address in the UK.
Yet former and current Royal Mail staff have told BBC Panorama that at times letters have been left behind in sorting offices, while parcels and tracked items are prioritised for delivery.
Over the last two decades we have been sending fewer letters, while at the same time there has been big growth in parcels, largely due to the boom in online shopping. Parcel delivery is important for customers and represents a growing business opportunity.
One former Royal Mail area manager, who left recently and asked to speak anonymously, says he was so short-staffed that for weeks at a time he instructed postal staff to leave letters behind.
""You knew that you were letting customers down and there was no hiding from it,"" he says. Those decisions were taken in consultation with his managers, he adds.
He also says that senior management would have known that letters were being left behind while tracked items and some parcels went out because every delivery office in the country collects data daily on what is and isn't being delivered.
He says that data was collated and sent up the management chain to the top of the company. It was ""impossible"" that the top of Royal Mail didn't know this was happening as ""everyone all the way up the chain was reporting those failures, was saying this is what we're prioritising"".
Royal Mail says it is its job to ensure every letter and parcel is delivered on time because that is what customers have been promised.
""There are certain times of the year particularly, or where you've got resourcing issues like Christmas, where volumes double. And we can tell you that sometimes it's logistically necessary to move the parcels first. However, it should not be happening as a matter of course. What should not be happening is that sort of instruction,"" says Jenny Hall of Royal Mail.
The postal regulator, Ofcom, investigated the issue of parcel prioritisation last year. It said it had not found evidence of a ""general organisation-wide policy directed by Royal Mail's senior management"" of prioritising parcels over letters in ""business-as-usual periods"".
But it said it was concerned that there was ""insufficient control, visibility and oversight"" by senior management over the decision-making at delivery offices.
The failure to meet its delivery targets is not the only challenge facing Royal Mail. It is also losing money, with a loss of £419m last year.
It could save hundreds of millions of pounds if the obligation to deliver letters six days a week were watered down or if it were allowed to take longer to deliver letters.
Reform to the service now seems inevitable, with Ofcom recently setting out options for changes to the service that it says it wants to see publicly debated.
Many people have told the BBC that they see Royal Mail as a vital public service. The challenge then is how to square that with Royal Mail's need to turn a profit.

2024-02-15T23:36:00.000Z,Whisky takes a shot at China's baijiu-dominated market,BBC News,"The Lunar New Year is traditionally a time for gathering with family and friends to eat and drink.
And for hundreds of years the drink of choice in China for these celebrations has been baijiu - a clear spirit made with fermented grains which packs a potent punch.
Baijiu is also often drunk straight and at social events such as weddings and birthdays.
Its Alcohol-By-Volume (ABV) can top 60% - in comparison spirits like scotch whisky and tequila typically have an ABV of around 40%.
""Baijiu certainly still has its place in Chinese liquor consumption, even among young consumers,"" says Allison Malmsten, public research director at Daxue Consulting.
It accounts for well over 90% of China's spirits sales, with annual sales of around $160bn (£127bn).
However, in recent times drinks from abroad have been growing in popularity in what is the world's biggest spirits market.
In 2022, sales of whisky in China were valued at $2.3bn, according to market research firm Euromonitor International.
That figure is expected to almost triple by 2027 as the whisky market there is expected to grow at around five times the rate seen globally.
Those sales are being driven by young, middle class, urban, educated and increasingly female drinkers.
Many of them are shunning baijiu in favour of less alcoholic spirits from outside China, according to Ms Malmsten.
The growth in demand for whisky in particular, has helped encourage international brands to open distilleries across China.
Amongst them is French drinks giant Pernod-Ricard, which owns the Jameson Irish whiskey brand as well as Beefeater Gin and Absolut Vodka. It is investing $140m in a production base near Emei Mountain in Sichuan Province, Southwest China.
UK-based rival Diageo also opened a plant in the Yunnan Province in December and is currently trialling production with plans to be fully up and running later this year. The company is also opening an Asia-Pacific Innovation hub in Shanghai.
""We are here for a long-term play,"" Managing Director for Diageo in China Atul Chhaparwal told the BBC.
He is bullish about the market, saying the demand is so strong that is space for everyone.
""Given the vibrancy of the overall whiskey category in China, there will be enough space for single malts, for blended whiskies, for local players, for imported whiskey, to grow,"" he says.
""Whiskey currently makes up less than 2% of the total spirits consumed in China, which indicates that how much room headroom everyone has to play in here,"" he adds.
That includes homegrown distilleries which have sprung up across the country. Pernod estimates there are between 30 and 50, with many still being built.
The whisky market is also expanding in other parts of Asia.
""The growth is immense"", spirits retailer Maison du Whisky's Jamie Li told the BBC in the French company's store in Singapore.
Mr Li, who heads sales to South Korea, Japan and China expects to see a boost during the Lunar New Year as Chinese tourists visit Singapore.
""Chinese New Year is kind of like Christmas in Europe - it's festive, people want to spend money, buy nice gifts and have something memorable. So whisky is part of their memory,"" he says.
There is also a growing number of collectors who ""buy and hold"" bottles of whisky which are expected to rise in value.
But it's not all smooth sailing for China's whisky market warns Ms Malmsten.
""The local distilleries are still in the early stages. 80% of the whisky has only been aged for two years or less. There's a lack of barrels and a lack of professionals to help with production,"" she says.
Still, if the success of China's wine industry is anything to go by, 'watch this space' when it comes to whisky.
""What we saw with China's wine industry is that once it started to mature, the demand for Chinese wines skyrocketed. In our recent survey, we found that after French wines, Chinese wines are the second most preferred,"" Ms Malmsten says.
""As China's whisky production matures, we might see a similar rise in demand for domestically produced whisky as well.""

2024-02-15T03:02:41.000Z,Elon Musk says SpaceX's legal home moved from Delaware to Texas,BBC News,"Elon Musk says he has moved the legal home of his rocket company SpaceX from the US state of Delaware to Texas.
Two weeks ago, Mr Musk said electric carmaker Tesla's shareholders will vote on making the same move. His brain-chip implant firm, Neuralink, has also relocated its legal home to Nevada.
Last month, a judge in Delaware annulled his $55.8bn (£44bn) pay package from Tesla.
Mr Musk has also recommended that other firms move away from Delaware.
In a post on on his social media platform X, formerly Twitter, the multi-billionaire said: ""SpaceX has moved its state of incorporation from Delaware to Texas!""
""If your company is still incorporated in Delaware, I recommend moving to another state as soon as possible,"" he added.
Many big US corporations, including Amazon, are registered in Delaware, which is known for having light taxation.
On 30 January, Judge Kathaleen McCormick found that Tesla directors, who negotiated Mr Musk's pay package in 2018, were ""perhaps starry eyed"" due to his ""superstar appeal"" and did not fully inform shareholders.
She said the deal was ""unfathomable"" and ruled it should be cancelled.
The pay deal was the biggest to date in US corporate history, helping to make Mr Musk the richest person in the world.
Mr Musk currently has an estimated net worth of around $200bn.
Tesla's pay package tied Mr Musk's compensation to performance targets, such as the firm's share price and profitability, but he does not receive a salary.
The lawsuit was filed by a shareholder, Richard Tornetta, who argued that it was an overpayment.
Despite owning just nine Tesla shares, Mr Tornetta launched legal action calling for the award to be rescinded.
Following the ruling, Mr Musk launched a poll on X, asking if Tesla should change its state of incorporation to Texas.
The poll had more than 1.1 million votes with over 87% voting in favour of the change.
""The public vote is unequivocally in favor of Texas!,"" Mr Musk posted on X.
The electric carmaker moved its corporate headquarters from Palo Alto in California to Austin, Texas in 2021.

2024-03-11T09:56:47.000Z,Currys takeover move scrapped by US firm Elliot,BBC News,"US investment firm Elliott Advisors has walked away from making a takeover bid for Currys after being rejected by the retailer's board ""multiple times"".
It had initially proposed an offer that valued the electricals chain at £700m, and then raised it to £757m.
But Currys rebuffed the approaches, stating that they ""significantly undervalued"" the business.
Currys could still receive a bid from China's JD.com, which said last month it was mulling an offer for the firm.
Currys has more than 800 stores globally and employs 28,000 people. In the UK, it operates about 300 stores with 15,000 staff.
Elliott, which owns UK bookseller Waterstones, said on Monday that it had made attempts to engage with the board of Currys, but had now chosen to back off.
It said it was ""not in an informed position to make an improved offer for Currys on the basis of the public information available to it"".
""Elliott therefore confirms it does not intend to make an offer for Currys,"" a statement added.
The rising cost of living in the past couple of years has hit many retailers as consumers cut back on spending, and Currys said last month that underlying sales had fallen 3% over the key Christmas trading period.
Despite this, the company increased its profit forecast for the year, helped by cost cuts and higher profit margins on some of its services.
Analysts have also noted that Currys' share price appears low given its market share and profitability, which has made the firm attractive to investors.
Following the news that Elliott Advisors had called off its takeover interest, Curry's share price fell by 8% in early trading on Monday.
When JD.com confirmed its interest in Currys last month, the Chinese e-commerce group said it was ""in the very preliminary stages"" of evaluating a possible bid.
Under UK takeover rules, JD.com has until 18 March to make a formal offer or walk away from the deal.

2024-02-09T12:05:25.000Z,Tesco Bank to be bought by Barclays in £600m deal,BBC News,"Barclays is buying Tesco's retail banking operations in a deal worth £600m to the supermarket giant.
Barclays is taking over Tesco Bank's credit cards, loans and savings accounts and has also agreed to market Tesco-branded banking services.
Under the deal, about 2,800 of Tesco's banking staff will transfer to Barclays.
Tesco said customers did not need to take any action and it would contact them over the coming months.
The supermarket has retained some of Tesco Bank's services, including insurance, ATMs, travel money and gift cards.
It has also agreed a partnership, initially for 10 years, under which Barclays will market and distribute credit cards, unsecured personal loans and deposits using the Tesco brand.
Shares in Tesco rose more than2% in early trading before falling back, and Barclays shares edged up slightly.
The supermarket's chief executive, Ken Murphy, said the deal would strengthen Tesco's finances and allow it to grow its core retail business, although the company said that the majority of the proceeds from the deal ""will be returned to shareholders"".
That will also include a £250m special dividend that Tesco Bank paid to the supermarket group in August last year.
In addition, the deal will allow Tesco to release £100m that is tied up for regulatory reasons, which will be added to the pot to return to shareholders.
Barclays said it would integrate the business into its own over time, and Tesco said the bank would work closely with the supermarket to support staff who were being transferred.
Barclays Group chief executive C.S. Venkatakrishnan said: ""This strategic relationship with the UK's largest retailer will help create new distribution channels for our unsecured lending and deposit businesses.
""We are able to bring our expertise in partnership cards developed over decades in the US to enhance further the highly successful Tesco Clubcard loyalty scheme.""
Tesco said the deal would offload a part of the business that needs a lot of investment, while it retains other assets that need less.
Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said Tesco was streamlining its assets having already parted ways with its credit cards, loans and savings operations.
""Doubling down on the core food business is a trend we're seeing many of the grocers adopt, as they reduce exposure to non-core activities and get ready to win the price wars, which have been raging since cost of living pressures soared,"" she said.
A decade ago, supermarkets were seen as among the most likely contenders to shake up the dominance of the High Street banks.
But their ready-made in-store branch network became far less relevant as digital technology advanced.
Instead, it was the app-based banks like Starling and Monzo which quickly became the true challengers.
Stricter regulation made financial services less appealing for the grocers too.
Tesco Bank did have current accounts, but closed them a few years ago because very few customers used them as their main account. Now - like Sainsbury's - it is getting out completely.
Last month, Sainsbury's said it was planning a ""phased withdrawal"" from its banking division in order to focus on its core food business.

2024-02-15T09:58:52.000Z,X accused of taking payments from terrorists,BBC News,"Elon Musk's X, formerly Twitter, granted subscription perks to designated terrorist groups and others barred from operating in the US, according to campaigners.
The Tech Transparency Project (TTP) found X had granted blue check marks to accounts tied to Hezbollah members, among others.
For $8 (£6.40) a month, a tick allows longer posts and better promotion.
X removed some ticks after the report, saying its security was ""robust"".
Mr Musk's decision to charge for check marks was one of the most controversial changes he made after he bought Twitter in 2022, with critics saying the move would make issues of disinformation worse, opening the platform to impersonators.
The badge was previously free, meant to indicate that the social media platform had verified the identity behind the account.
Many of the recipients were journalists, as well as world leaders and celebrities.
In some cases, those included people facing sanctions in the US, which opened the company to criticism that it was giving a platform to the wrong people and accusations that it was breaking US sanctions law.
Now that the system is paid, however, ""X may be raising new legal issues,"" the Tech Transparency Project said.
It said X had removed the ticks from the accounts it had identified after its report was published.
The TTP said an account run by Ansar Allah, known as the Houthis, had also seemingly paid for its blue check mark. The check mark has now been removed. The account has over 23,000 followers. The Houthis are sanctioned in both the US and UK. The UK government says on its website that it has sanctioned the Houthis ""to disrupt their ability to attack international shipping in the Red Sea, and to promote Yemen's peace, stability and security"".
The US Treasury, which outlines organisations the US will not trade with, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the BBC.
""The U.S. imposes sanctions on individuals, groups, and countries deemed to be a threat to national security. Elon Musk's X appears to be selling premium service to some of them"", the TTP wrote in its report.
""A blue checkmark account that bears the name and profile image of Hassan Nasrallah, the secretary-general of Hezbollah, also indicates it is 'ID verified', a service that X offers to premium subscribers as a way to prevent impersonation. X requires users to submit a government-issued ID and a selfie to get verified in this way, though it is unclear if Nasrallah did so"", it added.
Posting on X, the firm's team in charge of safety wrote that its subscription process was ""adhering to legal obligations"", and was independently screened by X's payment providers.
""Several of the accounts listed in the Tech Transparency Report are not directly named on sanction lists, while some others may have visible account check marks without receiving any services that would be subject to sanctions"", X wrote, adding that the firm would ""take action if necessary"" after reviewing TTP's report.
The TTP responded to the post saying even though some of the organisations were not named on the US sanctions list, they were owned by entities that are under US sanctions.
The director of the TTP Katie Paul told the New York Times that it was a sign that X had ""lost control of its platform"".
The owner of X, Elon Musk - who is also the chief executive of Tesla and one of the world's richest people - has previously said that he wants the social media platform to be like a ""town square"", advocating the right to free speech, while also removing illegal content.
But some decisions following Mr Musk's takeover of X have been controversial, including the reinstatement of rapper Kanye West's account in 2023 after an almost eight-month ban over offensive posts including antisemitic comments.
The TTP identified other accounts that had seemingly paid-for subscription accounts, including one belonging to NTV, a state-controlled television channel in Russia. The US made trade with Russia illegal after its invasion of Ukraine.

2024-02-07T08:04:22.000Z,"Boeing: Bolts missing from door, says blowout report",BBC News,"A door that blew away from a Boeing 737 Max shortly after take-off may not have been properly secured, a new report says.
The US National Transportation Safety Board has released initial findings from its probe into the incident on an Alaska Airlines plane in January.
It says four key bolts that were meant to lock the unused door to the fuselage appeared to be missing.
Replying to the report, Boeing said it was accountable for what happened.
In a statement, Boeing's president Dave Calhoun said: ""An event like this must not happen on an airplane that leaves our factory. We simply must do better for our customers and their passengers.""
""We are implementing a comprehensive plan to strengthen quality and the confidence of our stakeholders,"" he added.
The incident happened minutes after Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 took off, and involved a panel covering an unused emergency exit - known as a door plug. This suddenly blew out, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the main body of the aircraft, the fuselage.
The missing bolts appeared to have allowed the door panel to move out of position and break away from the aircraft, the report says.
It happened just moments after the flight took off from Portland International Airport.
The plane then suffered a rapid loss of cabin pressure, as air rushed out and the atmosphere within the plane equalised with the thinner air outside.
The door plug was manufactured by Boeing's supplier Spirit AeroSystems, and originally installed in the fuselage before being delivered to the aerospace giant.
According to the preliminary report, this door plug was later removed in the factory due to damage that had occurred during the production process.
Photographic evidence suggests that when the plug was reinstalled, at least three of the four locking bolts were not put back in place.
Damage to the door plug and its hinges, as well as a lack of damage to the areas where the bolts should have been, suggests that the bolts were missing before the door moved out of its normal position, the report said.
Spirit AeroSystems said it remain focused on working closely with Boeing and regulators ""on continuous improvement in our processes and meeting the highest standards of safety, quality and reliability"".
The findings are likely to make uncomfortable reading for Boeing, which has already faced harsh criticism over its corporate culture and quality control processes.
Inspections have already revealed loose bolts and fixings on other planes of the same specification, raising questions about the way they were built.
However, the BBC understands with inspections into the in-service 737-9s almost complete, no models have been found to be missing any of the four retention bolts.
In his response, Boeing's president and chief executive said its improvement plan would ""take significant, demonstrated action and transparency at every turn"".
Mr Calhoun said the airline manufacturer would implement new inspections of door plug assembly and fully document when the plug is removed.
Additional inspections into the supply chain and an independent assessment would also be included in the plans.
""This added scrutiny - from ourselves, from our regulator and from our customers - will make us better. It's that simple,"" Mr Calhoun said.
Prior to the Alaska Airlines incident, there had been other serious problems on the 737 Max production line, including the discovery of manufacturing defects affecting key parts of the planes, as well as a part protecting the central fuel tank against lightning strikes.
The scrutiny is all the more intense because of the history of the 737 Max itself.
The plane - a new version of Boeing's decades old workhorse - was involved in two major accidents in late 2018 and early 2019, in which 346 people were killed.
Those crashes were attributed to badly-designed flight control software, which forced both aircraft into catastrophic dives that the pilots were powerless to prevent.
In the aftermath, Boeing faced accusations from lawmakers and safety campaigners that it had put profits above the safety of passengers.
Testifying before US lawmakers today, the head of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Mike Whitaker said inspections of 737 Max aircraft had shown that ""the quality system issues at Boeing were unacceptable and require further scrutiny"".
He promised to put more ""boots on the ground"" in Boeing's factories in order to increase scrutiny of the manufacturer.
Boeing would be held accountable for any future failure or refusal to comply with the FAA, he added.
Last month, Boeing's chief executive Dave Calhoun told staff at the company it would co-operate with investigators and regulators ""to ensure all the procedures are put into place, inspections, all the readiness actions that are required to ensure every next airplane that moves into the sky is in fact safe and that this event can never happen again"".

The car's price is expected to be announced on 28 March.
China's fifth-largest smartphone maker says it has 59 stores in 29 cities around the country to take orders.
It comes as a price war intensifies between firms like BYD and Tesla in China, the world's biggest car market.
At the unveiling of the Speed Ultra 7 (SU7) last year,  Xiaomi's chief executive Lei Jun said the company aims to become one of the top five car makers in the world.
The smartphone giant has said it will invest $10bn (£7.8bn) in its vehicles business over the next 10 years.
Mr Lei said the SU7 was ""super electric motor"" technology which is capable of accelerating faster than some Tesla and Porsche EVs.
Xiaomi is also hoping that the car's shared operating system with its phones and other devices will appeal to existing customers.
It is one of the few new prospective entrants to the China's electric car market to gain approval from authorities as officials try to curb a flood of new players.
The SU7 will be made by a unit of state-owned car manufacturer BAIC Group at a plant in Beijing that can produce as many as 200,000 vehicles a year.
The launch of Xiaomi Automobile comes as a price war in China's EV market has been intensifying.
Tesla, which is headed by multi-billionaire Elon Musk, has cut the cost of its cars in China by thousands of dollars in recent months as local rivals like BYD have slashed its prices.

2024-02-13T09:03:31.000Z,Pay growth slows but still outpaces rising prices,BBC News,"Wage growth slowed again in the British jobs market but is still outpacing price rises, official figures show.
Pay, excluding bonuses, grew by 6.2% in the last three months of 2023 compared with the same period a year before, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
After taking price rises into account, pay went up by 1.9%.
But the statistics watchdog has said it could not guarantee the reliability of jobs market data.
The ONS is currently updating how it gathers information about employment, but this will not be fully in place until September.
The governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, has said that the ONS figures are the Bank's only way to gauge unemployment, so their current unreliability is ""posing challenges"" as policymakers weigh up what to do about interest rates in the coming months.
The Bank has been raising rates steadily over the past couple of years to try to reduce inflation, with the last rate rise in August 2023.
Higher interest rates cool inflation by making borrowing more expensive, discouraging people and firms from taking on debt to fund spending.
As higher rates have hit business and household finances, pay growth has been slowing from the highs seen last summer and the number of job vacancies has been falling too.
Wage growth data will be watched closely by the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee, which sets interest rates. But it will want to see more evidence of a tougher jobs market in order to avoid making cuts it may need to backtrack on later.
According to the latest figures, wage growth in Britain fell from 6.6% to 6.2%, slightly higher than economists had expected.
The number of vacancies fell for the 19th time in a row, down 26,000 to 932,000 in the three months to January.
However, there were some signs that the downward trend in job vacancies could be slowing, Liz McKeown, director of economic statistics at the ONS, told the BBC's Today programme.
The latest unemployment figures also suggest that the jobs market remains fairly resilient.
The unemployment rate across the UK fell to 3.8% in the final three months of 2023, down from 3.9% in the three months to November. It marked the lowest level seen since the November 2022 to January 2023 period.
Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said: ""It's good news that real wages are on the up for the sixth month in a row and unemployment remains low, but the job isn't done.
""Our tax cuts are part of a plan to get people back to work so we can grow the economy - but we must stick with it.""
Ms McKeown pointed out, though, that the new figures suggest there are historically high numbers of people saying they are long-term sick and unable to work or look for a new role.
Tony Wilson, director of the Institute for Employment Studies, said this rise in inactivity has happened despite rising salaries and the number of vacancies remaining above pre-pandemic levels.
""It reiterates the need for us to do far more to help people out of work to get into work, more to help people struggling in work to stay, and more to help employers fill their jobs. Otherwise weaknesses in our labour market will continue to hold back economic growth and widen social and economic inequalities,"" he said.
Liz Kendall MP, Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary, said that the higher number of those who are out of work due to long-term illness was ""costing taxpayers billions more a year in spiralling benefit bills"".
She added that Labour would ""tackle the root causes of worklessness by driving down NHS waiting lists, reforming social security"" and ""making work pay"".
Sarah Coles, head of personal finance at Hargreaves Lansdown, suggested that there are some other signs of weakness ""creeping into"" the jobs market.
She pointed out that there has been a rise in redundancies in recent months, which ""could be a blip, but it is well worth watching to see whether more structural weakness in the jobs market is on the way"".
How the economy performs will be a key focus in the run-up to a General Election due this year.
Some of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's key pledges last year focussed on tackling inflation and growing the economy and analysts are predicting that the chancellor is poised to cut some income taxes in a bid to win favour with voters.

2024-02-23T11:52:54.000Z,Post Office scandal victims set to be cleared by new law,BBC News,"Hundreds of people wrongly convicted in the Post Office scandal are set to have their names cleared under new legislation planned by the government.
The law is expected to come into effect by the end of July and will apply to convictions in England and Wales.
It will apply to convictions meeting specific criteria and is expected to clear the majority of victims.
The government said the possible exoneration of some genuinely guilty of crimes was ""a price worth paying"".
Between 1999 and 2015, more than 900 sub-postmasters were wrongly prosecuted due to faulty software.
Incorrect information provided by a computer system called Horizon, developed by Japanese firm Fujitsu, meant that sub-postmasters and postmistresses were prosecuted for stealing money.
Many of those convicted went to prison for false accounting and theft. Many were financially ruined.
Some sub-postmasters caught up in the scandal have died or taken their own lives in the intervening years. So far, 102 convictions have been overturned.
Keith Bell had been a sub-postmaster in Stockton-on-Tees since 1985, but like hundreds of others, he started noticing discrepancies in his accounts after Horizon was installed in his branch.
He called Post Office helplines, but was given little support. He spent more than £12,000 of his own money to make up the shortfalls, and eventually delayed some transactions to try to balance the books.
He was convicted of false accounting in 2002 and had to do 200 hours of community service.
He didn't challenge his conviction at the time, as he didn't have the means to take on the Post Office, and he believed he had been at fault.
But now the 75-year-old wants his name cleared and expects his conviction to be quashed.
""I'm relieved they are going to quash all the convictions, which is long overdue,"" he said in response to the announcement on Thursday. ""It's a relief to be able to talk to friends. It's a relief to be able to look people in the eye now.""
The issue was thrust back into the spotlight by an ITV drama, Mr Bates vs the Post Office, earlier this year.
Criticism had said that the process for overturning convictions and getting compensation was far too slow.
There are three main schemes aimed at groups of victims who had different experiences of the scandal - but the schemes have been accused of being long-winded and complicated.
Announcing the plans, Post Office Minister Kevin Hollinrake said the legislation was likely to ""exonerate a number of people who were, in fact, guilty of a crime"".
But he said: ""The government accepts that this is a price worth paying in order to ensure that many innocent people are exonerated.""
Some 700 people were prosecuted by the Post Office. Another 283 cases were brought by other agencies including the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP).
Prosecutions by the DWP will not be quashed under the new law.
A letter released by the Post Office after Mr Hollinrake's statement showed that its chief executive, Nick Read, had written to Justice Secretary Alex Chalk last month saying that the company ""would be bound to oppose an appeal"" in more than half the cases it had prosecuted.
It said that these cases ""involve convictions obtained by reliance on evidence unrelated to the Horizon computer system,"" and numbered 369, with a further 11 still under review.
The letter was sent on 9 January, shortly before the government first announced plans to use emergency legislation to exonerate all sub-postmasters.
However, the Post Office said the letter was ""in no way seeking to persuade government against mass exoneration"".
It said the purpose of the letter was ""primarily to offer the government any support that might assist them as they consider relevant issues in advance of passing legislation, without any value judgement on what the correct course of action might be"".
Mr Hollinrake said the new legislation would overturn all convictions that met certain criteria. It will only cover:
However, the government said it would work with the Scottish Government and Northern Ireland Executive to ensure their schemes to quash convictions were ""compatible with the UK compensation scheme"".
Labour MP Kevan Jones said he welcomed news of the legislation but added it was vital that the government set aside enough time for the new law to be passed ""as quickly as possible"".
""There are some initial key questions that need answering, including whether the Post Office's Capture system counts as a 'pilot' of the Horizon system for the purposes of this bill.""
Mr Hollinrake added he recognised the ""constitutional sensitivity"" of the planned legislation, but added it did not set a precedent for the future relationship between the government, Parliament and the judiciary.
""The scale and circumstances of this prosecutorial misconduct demands an exceptional response,"" he said.
""We are keen to ensure that the legislation achieves its goal of bringing prompt justice to all of those who were wrongfully convicted as a result of the scandal, followed by rapid financial redress.""
A spokesperson for DWP confirmed the new law would not apply to prosecutions brought by the department.
Between 2001 and 2006 ""a small number"" of Post Office staff were convicted for welfare-related fraud offences, mostly involving cashing in stolen benefit order books, they said.
""These criminal cases were not Horizon-related and followed lengthy, complex investigations, relying on multiple sources of evidence, including filmed surveillance, examination of stolen cashed orders and witness statements.
""While reference may have been made to Horizon in court, DWP did not rely on Horizon evidence to prove these cases, and this has been accepted by the Court of Appeal.""

2024-03-11T15:00:33.000Z,Taylor Swift-led vinyl revival recognised by price data gurus,BBC News,"Vinyl music sales - led by the soaring success of Taylor Swift - have been recognised by statisticians who calculate the rising cost of living.
After more than 30 years, vinyl records have returned to the basket of goods used by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) to track prices and work out the rate of inflation.
Air fryers have also been added to the virtual basket in its annual review.
But hand sanitiser, a must-have of the Covid years, has been taken out.
The influence of singer-songwriter Swift is not confined to the world of music where she has megastar status. Her mere presence at American football games to watch her boyfriend Travis Kelce has been credited with raising NFL viewing figures.
Now that influence seems to have spread to the rock and roll world of economic statistics.
Her album 1989 (Taylor's Version) was the best-selling vinyl LP of last year, followed by the Rolling Stones' Hackney Diamonds.
UK sales of vinyl LPs hit their highest level since 1990, increasing for the 16th year in a row, according to the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) trade group.
So, for the first time since 1992, when the likes of Wet Wet Wet and Shakespears Sister were top of the charts, records are back in the ONS's inflation basket.
Rightly so, according to Adriaan Neervoort, owner of Wanted Music, in Beckenham, Kent, who said: ""Vinyl has a more engaging human sound, it comes beautifully packaged. People want to know more about music and they want to engage with it more.""
The basket contains more than 700 goods and services. The cost of these items in many different outlets are gathered by the ONS to give the monthly inflation figures. The latest show prices rising at 4% a year, down from a recent peak of 11% in 2022.
In itself, the rate of inflation is an important measure used in government pledges, during decisions about uprating benefits and pensions, and quoted during pay negotiations. It is also crucial for the interest people pay to borrow money. The Bank of England has a target of keeping inflation at 2% when it sets interest rates.
The basket of goods also offers an insight into our fashions and spending habits.
Wild rabbit was one item included in the first list of 1947. Tea bags only made it in by 1980.
The ONS reviews the basket once a year, and the changes it makes are only a small percentage of the items sampled.
This time, 16 items have been added, and 15 removed. Among the newcomers are air fryers, signalling their popularity among households trying to reduce their energy use and costs.
Healthy living is reflected, with the addition of spray oils and rice cakes as well as sunflower and pumpkin seeds. Women's socks were considered under-represented, so have been added.
While squeezed household budgets affected what has gone into the basket, the lessening influence of the pandemic and lockdowns is seen in what has been taken out.
Demand for hand hygiene gel has fallen and so is given less space on shop shelves. It has been removed from the basket.
So too has bakeware - popular when people were unable to go out, but actually taken out of the basket because the ONS considered it over-represented among household items.
Also going are sofa beds, with pull-out beds becoming more popular, as well as hot rotisserie-cooked whole chicken, and draught stout - because its price movements are very similar to draught bitter.
Matt Corder from the ONS said its inflation basket of goods ""offers a fascinating snapshot of consumer spending through the years"".
""Often the basket reflects the adoption of new technology, but the return of vinyl records shows how cultural revivals can affect our spending,"" he added.
While more than four-fifths of recorded music is consumed via streaming, vinyl has made a huge comeback, with fans seeing it as more collectible and having better sound quality.

2024-02-12T00:03:22.000Z,Horizon scandal: Five short-changed postmasters to get full compensation,BBC News,"A small group of former sub-postmasters whose convictions were overturned have finally been told they will receive full compensation.
They had been offered a much lower sum by the Post Office because it did not believe evidence about Horizon software was essential in their prosecutions.
But now Post Office Minister Kevin Hollinrake has agreed they should have equal treatment.
For Teju Adedayo and Parmod Kalia it is a huge relief.
""I'm extremely grateful to the minister for this u-turn, but it should never have happened in the first place,"" said Ms Adedayo.
""About time, too,"" adds Mr Kalia.
It brings an end to years of frustration for the pair, who said it left those in their position feeling ""victimised all over again"".
They are two of just five sub-postmasters who became known as the ""public interest cases"".
When Ms Adedayo and Mr Kalia had their convictions quashed at Southwark Crown Court in 2021, the Post Office did not oppose their appeals on the grounds that it wasn't in the public interest to pursue a retrial.
However, the Post Office said if there had been retrials, there was a reasonable prospect of conviction and therefore Ms Adedayo and Mr Kalia were not owed full compensation for malicious prosecution.
For Professor Chris Hodges, chair of the Independent Horizon Compensation Advisory Board, their situation was ""unfinished business"".
""I'm delighted these victims of a procedural trap are to be treated fairly and on a par with all others whose convictions are to be overturned,"" he said. ""The injustice of their situation has rightly been recognised.""
For Ms Adedayo and Mr Kalia, it has been a bitter pill to swallow after fighting to clear their names.
""I believe the Post Office was being spiteful. Instead of accepting they'd made a mistake,"" said Ms Adedayo.
Hundreds of sub-postmasters were prosecuted for stealing money because of incorrect information provided by a computer system called Horizon, developed by Fujitsu.
""It was Horizon that showed the discrepancy, and based on that, our cases are Horizon-related,"" said Mr Kalia, who used to run a post office in south east London.
After suffering for so long, both felt under pressure to accept a financial settlement offered to them by the Post Office - a sum well short of what was offered to others who were wrongfully convicted.
""I've suffered 21 years of this,"" says Mr Kaia. He added: ""I was advised by my family to take it, and turn your back on the rest of it.""
He was sentenced to six months in prison after being advised by his union representative to plead guilty to theft in 2001.
Since then, he has suffered poor physical and mental health, and at one stage attempted to take his own life.
He kept his conviction a secret - even from people close to him - for 15 years.
Ms Adedayo also falsely confessed to being responsible for the shortfalls at her post office in Kent to avoid the risk of ending up in prison. In the end, she was given a suspended sentence and ordered to complete 200 hours of community service.
""I could not imagine leaving my children and going to jail,"" said Ms Adedayo. ""How was I going to survive that? I was so petrified.""
She pleaded guilty to false accounting and says her criminal record has made it difficult for her to find work since.
""For the past 17 years, it's been a struggle,"" she said. ""It has affected my children, my family - my dad had a heart attack.""
Now, Ms Adedayo, Mr Kalia and the rest of the group of five will be included in the same compensation scheme as others who were wrongfully convicted.
In a statement, Mr Hollinrake told the BBC: ""All affected postmasters should be treated equally and anyone who lost out due to the Post Office IT scandal will receive full and fair compensation.
""That's why I've agreed that the five postmasters who were previously not, are now eligible for compensation including the £600,000 offer if they wish to take that.""
Those whose convictions are overturned can choose to take a fast-tracked £600,000 settlement, or can enter into negotiations if they feel they are entitled to more. All eligible people are entitled to an ""interim"" payment of £163,000 while their final settlements are processed.
Mr Kalia said he is going to choose the alternative option of a full assessment for compensation, given all that he lost.
Although he fears that could be yet another battle ahead.

2024-02-27T12:29:00.000Z,Marks & Spencer raises pay in battle for supermarket staff,BBC News,"Marks & Spencer has announced pay rises for staff from April, as supermarkets fight to keep employees.
It will increase minimum pay for workers outside of London to £12 per hour, with staff in the capital seeing a raise to £13.15 per hour.
The increase means all of its workers will be paid the voluntary Real Living Wage, which is higher than the compulsory National Living Wage.
About 40,000 staff across the food and clothing retailer will get a raise.
The company also announced it would be making ""substantial improvements"" to its maternity, paternity and adoption policies.
M&S's minimum pay for staff outside London is currently £10.90 per hour, while those in London receive £12.05.
With the National Living Wage, often referred to as the minimum wage, set to rise to £11.44 an hour in April 2024 - and for the first time will include 21 and 22-year-olds - the increases mean workers at the retailer will earn 56p more per hour than the government minimum wage.
M&S is joining Aldi, Sainsbury's and Lidl in increasing its minimum pay for staff outside of London to £12 per hour. Aldi's higher pay has been in place since the start of February, while Lidl and Sainsbury's increased wage will benefit workers from March.
Since April last year, Britain's biggest grocer Tesco has been paying workers £11.02 an hour outside London and £11.95 in the capital.
But Tesco and others will need to increase worker wages at least in line with the new minimum wage when it comes into effect this April.
M&S announced on Tuesday that its team support managers would also receive a wage increase to £13.05 per hour outside of London and £14.20 in the capital.
The retailer said the increases meant that since March 2022, it had invested more than £146m in its overall retail pay package.
Meanwhile, M&S said that from April 2024 it would be one of the first retailers to introduce six weeks' paternity leave at full pay.
The supermarket added it was ""almost doubling"" maternity and adoption leave to 26 weeks - also at full pay - which it said equated to a £5m investment annually.
Chief executive Stuart Machin said M&S wanted to be the UK's most trusted retailer and employer.
""But creating a great place to work isn't just about pay; it's about the overall package and colleagues feeling valued and able to be their best,"" he added.

Walt Disney's ESPN, Fox Corp and Warner Bros. Discovery own a wide range of portfolios of sports rights including those for the FIFA World Cup, Formula 1, NFL, NBA and Major League Baseball.
They hope to capture younger audiences and save costs.
The service would have ""a new brand with an independent management team"" which would be available via a new app.
Its pricing will be announced at a later date, according to their statement.
The firms say each company will own one-third of the joint venture and have equal board representation.
The announcement comes as sports leagues charge more for broadcasting rights.
Instead of just linear TV operators, the fees are increasingly split between multiple media distributors.
The product will bring sports linear networks and Disney's direct-to-consumer ESPN+ together, according to their statement.
They added that the new joint venture aims ""to serve sports fans, particularly those outside of the traditional pay TV bundle"".
Subscribers would also have the ability to bundle the product with the companies' streaming platforms Disney+, Hulu and Max.
Bob Iger, the chief executive officer of Walt Disney called the launch ""a major win for sports fans, and an important step forward for the media business"".
The boss of Fox, Lachlan Murdoch, said the service would make ""an array of amazing sports content all in one place"" while David Zaslav, the CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery said it ""exemplifies our ability as an industry to drive innovation and provide consumers with more choice, enjoyment"".
The popularity of streaming services has increased in recent years, and traditional media companies have had to invest quickly to compete with the likes of Netflix, Amazon Video and Apple TV.

The latest sale brings the total number of shares he has sold in the firm over the last nine trading days to about 50 million, with a value of around $8.5bn.
The tech giant had previously said Mr Bezos would sell up to 50 million shares by the end of January 2025.
His sales of Amazon stock comes after they have risen by more than 76% in the past year.
Mr Bezos, who is the firm's founder and executive chair, had previously last sold Amazon shares in 2021.
He has also given away shares in Amazon as part of his philanthropy, most recently in 2022.
As Mr Bezos moved to Miami in Florida from Seattle in Washington last year, he will save almost $600m in tax on the $8.5bn worth of stock he has sold.
Gains above $250,000 from the sale of shares or other long term investments, are taxed at 7% in Washington state. Florida does not have state taxes on incomes or capital gains.
However, he will still be liable to federal taxes as a result of selling the shares.
When Mr Bezos announced his move to Florida it prompted speculation over whether it was because of a potential tax bill he would have faced in Washington after the state approved a new tax on large stock sales.
Mr Bezos said in November that his parents had recently moved back to Miami where he spent some of his childhood and that he wanted to be close to them and to his Blue Origin space project, which was ""increasingly shifting to Cape Canaveral"".
""Lauren and I love Miami,"" he wrote on Instagram, referring to his fiancée Lauren Sánchez.
""For all that, I'm planning to return to Miami, leaving the Pacific Northwest,"" he added.
Mr Bezos remains Amazon's biggest shareholder and is one of the richest people in the world, with an estimated fortune of more than $190bn.
Amazon did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment.

2024-03-13T00:06:25.000Z,Why firms are bringing their manufacturing back home,BBC News,"Chris Ball and Ian Whateley sit around a large office table and talk about how much they are benefiting from UK firms reshoring.
Reshoring is when a company decides to stop getting its manufacturing done overseas, such as in China, and instead returns the work to its home country.
Mr Ball and Mr Whateley are the bosses of Shropshire-based Advanced Chemical Etching (Ace), which makes precision metal components for customers in the aerospace, automotive, electronics and telecoms sectors.
They say that Ace's order book is greatly improving as its clients increasingly bring manufacturing work back to the UK. ""We recently had a £800,000 boost in orders, with probably in the region of about £250,000 to £350,000 of that from reshoring,"" says Mr Ball. ""And there's a lot of stuff that is just at the quotation stage too.""
We have all heard of offshoring, which started as a major economic movement in the 1990's, when companies started to relocate their manufacturing abroad. They more often went to China, where incentives from the Chinese government were generous, and the workers were cheap.
The result was a Chinese manufacturing boom, and a long supply chain from Europe and the US to China and beyond.
But now the West is fighting back, with an increasing trend towards reshoring. More than half of UK manufacturers are now reshoring, according to one study at the start of this year.
Other firms are ""near shoring"", which means that while they are still getting their manufacturing done overseas, they are moving it to a nearer country.
And then there is so-called ""friend shoring"", whereby you keep your manufacturing abroad, but move it to a country that has friendlier relationships with your own. Apple is said to be doing this, as it increasingly moves production from China to India.
The motives for this shift are complex and varied, but break down into three main groups - economics, risk and politics.
The big attraction of offshoring in the first place was that it was cheaper and therefore more profitable to make things in places like China or Indonesia, not least because the labour there was much cheaper. But several factors have worked to reduce those benefits
Firstly, wages have risen in such countries, while new technology means that Western factories need fewer staff, and are therefore cheaper.
Also, the increasing speed of product development is fuelling this trend. Phones, TVs, games terminals, pretty much everything is being improved, changed, and updated all the time.
It is far easier to do that in a capital-intensive factory in Birmingham or Baltimore, than one in Beijing, as Prof Dennis Novy an expert in trade economics at Warwick University explains.
""Production runs are becoming much shorter, products are changing much more rapidly, and actually having access to the manufacturers and the suppliers in a local area makes you much more flexible and that is actually a factor behind this,"" he says.
Then there is the ""Amazon factor"" - increasingly we all demand our new products tomorrow, at the latest. If they are made close by that is easy, if they are made on the other side of the world there are obviously delays, or the company has to hold large stocks of goods in case of orders which have to be filled immediately.
Stocks which are costly to hold and will be out of date the second the product is updated.
Then there is the risk factor, as Covid showed us the supply chains that we in the West all depend on are very long, stretched and vulnerable. It was a wakeup call for the West, is it safe to be reliant for many essential on factories on the other side of the world, shipped over huge distances?
The recent attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and the water shortage crisis that is massively reducing shipping through the Panama Canal have also shown that there are pinch points on supply chains routes that are very risky and unreliable.
In short, you do not get Houthi attacks in the English Channel, or between Mexico and the US, although Prof Novy thinks these concerns have been overplayed. ""Ultimately this is not the first time that the Red Sea has been in the news. There have been similar disruptions elsewhere… but I don't see this being a major headache.""
Finally, there is the politics, in the US and Europe leaders have been encouraging the return of manufacturing. It is not just the patriotic thing to do, western governments have become increasingly aware that they are becoming dependent on potential enemy nations for their cutting-edge technology and supplies.
In America Presidents Biden and Trump have tried to address this issue, President Trump with tariffs, and President Biden with financial incentives. Mr Biden has been throwing hundreds of billions of dollars at making American industry make things in the US, especially microchips via the 2022 Chips Act. This pledged $52bn (£41bn) to boost domestic production of computer chips.
The Biden administration is also giving $15.5bn to the US electric car sector.
Lisa Anderson, head of US management consultancy LMA Consulting Group, is a supply chain expert. She says that the Chips Act ""has spurred on certainly quite a bit of investment"" in that sector.
Regarding the US manufacturing sector as a whole, in 2022 reshoring and foreign direct investment announcements hit their highest rate on record.
That is according to the business group that monitors this development, the Reshoring Institute. It says that record highs continued in the first half of last year, with 300,000 new jobs likely created for 2023 as a whole.
And it is not just American workers who are benefitting from US firms bringing manufacturing closer to home. Mexico is also booming, says Ms Anderson, who points out that America's southern neighbour now exports more goods to the US than China.
Mexico exported $475.6bn of goods to the US last year, up 5% from 2022, according to official US figures. Meanwhile the US imported a total of $427.2bn from China, a 20% decrease.
Mexico has all the advantages these days - cheap labour, ease and speed of access to the American market, and it is a friendly neighbour of the US inside a free-trade zone. The classic example of both friend and near shoring.
But the town of Telford in Shropshire is also doing well. Ace's Mr Ball says the firm is due to be visited by a an aerospace company, ""and they're looking at bringing stuff in from other areas of the world"".
Re-shoring is obviously on a roll.

2024-02-28T00:01:29.000Z,HMRC slammed as phone line waits get even longer,BBC News,"Customer service at HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) is at an all-time low as phone line waiting times continue to deteriorate, according to MPs.
Nearly two-thirds of taxpayers were forced to wait more than 10 minutes to speak to an adviser, a committee found.
MPs launched another blistering attack on HMRC years after declaring its hold music was among the most streamed.
HMRC said its digital services provided answers to millions of queries and was ""highly rated"".
The average wait for a call to HMRC to be answered was 16 minutes and 24 seconds in the year to April 2023, according to the report by the Public Accounts Committee. That compares with 12 minutes and 22 seconds the previous year.
Some 63% of callers waited more than 10 minutes to speak to an adviser, up from 46% in 2021-22. The committee said this proportion had increased every year since 2018-19.
""Almost eight years have passed since our committee challenged HMRC over its telephone lines' holding message being one of the most streamed pieces of music in the country,"" said Meg Hillier, who chairs the committee.
""Our latest report into its performance sadly illustrates a continued tale of decline in its services.""
The tax authority has long-documented difficulties in swiftly answering calls. It sparked controversy when it closed its main self-assessment helpline over the summer, and encouraged people to use a chatbot instead.
It has used an answer by text service and told MPs that it did not have the resources to meet rising demand. It said it received more than three million calls on resetting online passwords, getting tax codes, and checking National Insurance numbers, all of which could easily be done via digital channels instead.
The committee said that more people were being drawn into paying tax, known as fiscal drag, and their tax affairs were becoming more complicated. As a result HMRC's customer service was ""struggling to cope"" and taxpayers were left ""exasperated"" by the quality of support.
Among the other issues highlighted in the report, published on Wednesday, were:
In May, the BBC revealed how Cardiff flat owner Dylan Davies received 11,000 tax bills from HMRC over the course of six months, after Chinese companies fraudulently used his address to register for VAT.
The committee highlighted a case in which a taxpayer received more than 10,000 letters due to an agent registering companies for VAT at the taxpayer's address rather than a serviced office that shared the same postcode.
""These cases create particular distress for innocent citizens receiving these demands for payments, and an extraordinary amount of time and effort to resolve with HMRC,"" the committee said.
The MPs said that the distress caused to innocent people was not being taken seriously enough.
A spokesman for HMRC said it was making strong progress on improving customer services, with a focus on digital services.
""Millions more people used our highly rated online services last year - saving them waiting on the phone and freeing up our advisers to deal with those people who need extra support,"" he said.
""People used our app and online services more than 200 million times last year with an 80% satisfaction rate, while three-quarters of all customer correspondence was answered in 15 working days - a significant improvement on the 45% in 2021-22.""

Elliott has said it is now considering whether or not to make a formal offer for Currys, and under UK takeover regulations it has until 16 March to decide.
Like many High Street businesses, Currys has been struggling with falling sales as customers cut back on spending.
Last month, the company said like-for-like sales - which strip out the impact of store openings and closures - fell 3% over the key Christmas trading period.
Despite this, cost-cutting measures meant that Currys increased its profit forecast for the year.
However, shares in Currys have fallen by more than a third over the past year and on Friday they closed at 47.08p, valuing the business at about £534m.
In a statement, Currys said that its board had considered the ""unsolicited"" proposal from Elliot and ""concluded that it significantly undervalued the company and its future prospects"".
As well as the Currys stores in the UK and Ireland, the business trades under the Elkjøp brand in the Nordic region.
Last November, the company announced a deal to sell its Greek business - which trades under the Kotsovolos brand - for £175m.

2024-02-07T12:58:53.000Z,"Scandal-hit business group will survive, says new boss",BBC News,"The new head of the CBI has said there is ""jeopardy"" over whether it can survive, after allegations of rape and sexual assault hit the business group last year.
Dozens of its members including John Lewis and BMW quit the group following the claims.
The group settled legal action brought by its former boss Tony Danker for wrongful dismissal on Monday.
Rupert Soames told the BBC that the CBI still had an important role to play.
In his first broadcast interview, Mr Soames admitted to concerns around whether the 60-year-old lobbying group could survive the ""reputational disaster"" which has seen dozens of its high-profile members leave.
Companies including John Lewis, Tesco, Aviva and Jaguar Land Rover quit their membership after a series of scandals involving allegations of sexual harassment, rape and drug taking rocked the organisation which tries to promote best practice within business.
On Monday, the CBI said it had settled a case for wrongful dismissal brought by Mr Danker, its former director general.
Mr Danker was sacked with immediate effect in 2023 following complaints about his behaviour, despite the lobbying group clarifying Mr Danker was completely unconnected to the most serious allegations.
Mr Soames - former CEO of Serco and current chair of Smith and Nephew - insisted the CBI still had an important role to play as an advocate of business interests.
""I think that people have found that life without the CBI has left something missing,"" Mr Soames said.
He claimed the CBI was instrumental in securing Treasury tax breaks for businesses that invest heavily in the UK, as well as helping to sway the government into offering extra free childcare in England in the Autumn Statement.
Of 270 members that halted their membership, 80% have now returned, he added.
But not everyone agrees. One former member told the BBC it wouldn't re-join, and said: ""It has been effectively absent from UK civic life for a year and what have we missed? Nothing.""
The exodus of some of its deepest-pocketed members plunged the group into a financial crisis that resulted in it cutting one third of its 300 staff, closing overseas offices and having to arrange emergency financing last year.
The City of London Police said there was ""one remaining matter"" under investigation following the allegations which emerged last year.
It had investigated a number of cases that were not able to ""progress further criminally"", said detective chief superintendent Richard Waight. He urged anyone with relevant information to contact the police.
Mr Soames admitted that there was still some doubt as to whether the group could survive this, as it has to refinance its bank debt in autumn of this year.
""We are essentially an SME [small and medium-sized enterprise]. ""We were grateful that a number of banks agreed to finance us, but like many other businesses we are here at the pleasure of our lenders.
""There is jeopardy in anything you do in life. We have to cut our cloth according to our means.""
The voice of business has had a fractious relationship with the Conservative government over the last decade. Former PM Boris Johnson famously used an expletive when asked about business concerns during the Brexit negotiations.
At the depths of the CBI's crisis last April, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said there was ""no point in talking to the CBI if its members aren't talking to it"".
Relations have since thawed, with the chancellor attending a slimmed-down CBI conference last November.
However, Mr Soames believes both parties now understand the CBI's importance.
""We notice a position that probably hasn't been true since Tony Blair first ran for office, where you have both the Conservative and Labour Party explicitly recognising the importance of business in getting growth going,"" Mr Soames said.
There are myriad other business groups, many of which are more specialised to the needs of their members - the SMMT for cars, Hospitality UK, UK Finance, Make UK for manufacturers.
But Mr Soames insisted that if the CBI didn't exist it would still be necessary to invent it.

2024-02-29T00:01:42.000Z,Family lose £165 Ryanair check-in dispute,BBC News,"A passenger who lost his dispute with Ryanair after being charged £165 to check in at the airport has said he does not regret taking on the airline.
""I was so mad at the time, I had to try something. It ruined a couple of days of my holiday,"" dad-of-two Damian Lloyd, from Neath, told the BBC.
Ryanair said Mr Lloyd had ""unchecked"" his family and charged him to check in again, which he disputed.
But an independent ombudsman ruled in favour of the airline.
AviationADR, an independent airline dispute resolution scheme, said that Ryanair had ""adhered to their own Terms and Conditions"".
""The airline has provided evidence that despite the passenger checking in online on 21st June, they also checked out on 22nd July. This is the reasons why the printed boarding passes were invalid and a new check in was required,"" it said in its ruling at the end of last year.
Speaking to the BBC, Mr Lloyd said he did not regret going through the dispute resolution service, despite Ryanair being ""really rude"". He said the airline ""didn't want to know and that made me more angry"".
AviationADR said the determination was not binding and that Mr Lloyd had the option to continue the complaint through the courts.
But the 50-year-old said: ""That's me forking out money for a case then, I'll just leave it.""
Health and safety manager Mr Lloyd had booked a 10-day family holiday to Gran Canaria in July.
He had checked in online but was left ""in total shock"" when his, his wife's and his daughter's boarding passes did not scan.
A Ryanair employee at the check-in desk was equally confused, but as it was an early morning flight, they could not phone Ryanair's customer service to investigate the problem as it was not yet open.
The family was given a choice - either wait for customer service to open and miss their flights, or pay for new passes - which they did.
Mr Lloyd said he was told he could ""claim the money back,"" but when he requested a refund, Ryanair rejected the claim, before being told he had unchecked the day before his flight.
At the time, Mr Lloyd told the BBC: ""Ryanair came up with every excuse under the sun. I felt wronged.
""If they would have said sorry and offered me 10% off my next flight, I would have been happier.""
The issue of airline fees was already in the spotlight last summer after an elderly couple were charged £110 by Ryanair to print their tickets at the airport.
The couple told the BBC they had to pay airport check-in fees after mistakenly downloading their return tickets instead of their outgoing ones. Airport check-in fees were far more expensive than downloadable boarding passes.
Regarding Mr Lloyd's case, Rory Boland, editor of Which? Travel, said: ""It's clearly unfair to charge customers £165 to print out three pieces of paper for a genuine mistake. 'Gotcha' fees like this are part of the reason Ryanair is regularly rated one of the UK's worst airlines.""
Ryanair did not respond to the BBC's request to comment.

2024-03-11T21:08:36.000Z,Boeing whistleblower John Barnett found dead in US,BBC News,"A former Boeing employee known for raising concerns about the firm's production standards has been found dead in the US.
John Barnett worked for Boeing for more than 30 years before retiring in 2017.
In the days before his death, he had been giving evidence in a whistleblower lawsuit against the company.
Boeing said it was saddened to hear of Mr Barnett's passing. The Charleston County coroner confirmed his death to the BBC on Monday.
It said the 62-year-old had died from a ""self-inflicted"" wound on 9 March and police were investigating.
Mr Barnett had worked for the US plane giant for more than 30 years, until his retirement in 2017 on health grounds.
From 2010, he worked as a quality manager at the North Charleston plant making the 787 Dreamliner, a state-of-the-art airliner used mainly on long-haul routes.
In 2019, Mr Barnett told the BBC that under-pressure workers had been deliberately fitting sub-standard parts to aircraft on the production line.
He also said he had uncovered serious problems with oxygen systems, which could mean one in four breathing masks would not work in an emergency.
He said soon after starting work in South Carolina he had become concerned that the push to get new aircraft built meant the assembly process was rushed and safety was compromised, something the company denied.
He later told the BBC that workers had failed to follow procedures intended to track components through the factory, allowing defective components to go missing.
He said in some cases, sub-standard parts had even been removed from scrap bins and fitted to planes that were being built to prevent delays on the production line.
He also claimed that tests on emergency oxygen systems due to be fitted to the 787 showed a failure rate of 25%, meaning that one in four could fail to deploy in a real-life emergency.
Mr Barnett said he had alerted managers to his concerns, but no action had been taken.
Boeing denied his assertions. However, a 2017 review by the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), did uphold some of Mr Barnett's concerns.
It established that the location of at least 53 ""non-conforming"" parts in the factory was unknown, and that they were considered lost. Boeing was ordered to take remedial action.
On the oxygen cylinders issue, the company said that in 2017 it had ""identified some oxygen bottles received from the supplier that were not deploying properly"". But it denied that any of them were actually fitted on aircraft.
After retiring, he embarked on a long-running legal action against the company.
He accused it of denigrating his character and hampering his career because of the issues he pointed out - charges rejected by Boeing.
At the time of his death, Mr Barnett had been in Charleston for legal interviews linked to that case.
Last week, he gave a formal deposition in which he was questioned by Boeing's lawyers, before being cross-examined by his own counsel.
He had been due to undergo further questioning on Saturday. When he did not appear, enquiries were made at his hotel.
He was subsequently found dead in his truck in the hotel car park.
Speaking to the BBC, his lawyer described his death as ""tragic"".
In a statement Boeing said: ""We are saddened by Mr. Barnett's passing, and our thoughts are with his family and friends.""
His death comes at a time when production standards at both Boeing and its key supplier Spirit Aerosystems are under intense scrutiny.
This follows an incident in early January when an unused emergency exit door blew off a brand-new Boeing 737 Max shortly after take-off from Portland International Airport.
A preliminary report from the US National Transportation Safety Board suggested that four key bolts, designed to hold the door securely in place, were not fitted.
Last week, the FAA said a six-week audit of the company had found ""multiple instances where the company allegedly failed to comply with manufacturing quality control requirements"".

2024-03-04T15:20:59.000Z,"Store thefts: I've been hit by bottles, says retailer as crime soars",BBC News,"""I've been bottled a number of times,"" says convenience store owner Ben Selvaratnam. ""I've had at least 20 stitches.""
The rise in thefts and violence has forced the London businessman to spend thousands on new security measures.
It comes as new data shows shop owners have reported a 400% increase in thefts during 2023, setting a new record.
The Association of Convenience Stores (ASC) said shops recorded 5.6 million theft incidents last year.
That is up from 1.1 million the year previously. Violence is also up - with 76,000 incidents reported, compared to 41,000 in the 12-months prior, the ASC said.
Freshfields Market in Croydon has been owned by Mr Selvaratnam for eight years. It sells fresh produce, meat and alcohol but loses ""hundreds of pounds a week"" to shoplifting.
Mr Selvaratnam used to have 12 CCTV cameras in the Church Street store, but because of the jump in shoplifting he spent £3,000 last year to ""capture blind spots"" and now has 40 of them.
The 40-year-old also laid out on other security measures - spending £5,000 on a new steel and glass cage around the till area ""because the cashiers kept getting jumped on and spat at"".
He also installed a smoke-activated panic system similar to those used in jewellers and banks ""to protect my staff"".
But the businessman has been forced to close in the evenings at 21.30, unlike others in the area which stay open until 23.00.
""Most of my staff don't want to work till then,"" he said. ""It impacts our bottom line, incurring these costs, we're not able to operate profitably. We're 25% down on 2022 in terms of revenue.""
However, it is not just in terms of lost sales that Mr Selvaratnam has been affected.
""I've been bottled a number a times, been to A&E twice and had at least 20 stitches. With these attacks and them saying 'We know what time you finish, how can you stop me?', it's been awful. You just don't know how a day is going to end.""
In its 2024 Crime Report, the ASC said local shops were facing a retail crime crisis, with retailers recording over 600 incidents of theft an hour over the last year.
It said retailers were doing ""what they can to fight back"", spending £339m over the past year in areas such as CCTV and security staff.
ASC chief executive James Lowman said shop owners were facing an ""onslaught"" of crime, with some losing tens of thousands of pounds per year to theft alone.
Small shops in particular were often seen as an ""easier target for thieves"" compared to larger supermarkets, Mr Lowman said.
""Most convenience stores don't have the resources to be able to put security staff on the door which can act as an effective deterrent, and convenience stores operate in every kind of location so thieves will feel more confident about disappearing into rural areas or estates after committing offences.
""This extended crimewave cannot be allowed to continue,"" he added.
Police to treat shoplifting like organised crime
Mr Lowman said while there had been ""positive steps forward"" with the Retail Crime Action Plan and the launching of Operation Pegasus to try and better identify prolific offenders the report showed more needed to be done.
""Nobody should have to come to work and face what retailers and their colleagues have faced over the last year,"" he said.
In Scotland, staff working in shops, bars and restaurants are protected from abuse via the Protection of Workers Act which came into force in 2021.
According to the retail trade union Usdaw there have been more than 500 convictions since the law has been introduced and there are now calls for the UK government to follow Scotland's lead with an amendment to its Criminal Justice Bill.

Meanwhile, in Croydon, staff at Freshfields Market do not call police over an incident ""unless it's violent"", Mr Selvaratnam said. ""We can't be stuck on the phone for 45 minutes knowing they won't attend.""
The shoplifters who target the shop fall into various categories. ""Drug addiction is ongoing, it's always been there, but there's more organised gangs stealing to order,"" Mr Selvaratnam said.
""Definitely there's been an increase in pensioners and mums with pushchairs, those who've been customers for years and who now can't make ends meet,"" he added.
The married father-of-three put the business up for sale last year but has so far been unable to sell. ""We're between a rock and a hard place,"" he said. ""I don't want my wife or my kids to ever come here.""

2024-02-20T17:46:00.000Z,The Body Shop to shut up to half of its UK stores,BBC News,"The Body Shop is set to shut up to half of its 198 stores in the UK and cut the size of its head office, leading to hundreds of job losses.
Closures will begin immediately on Tuesday, the firm that is overseeing the restructuring of the beauty retailer said.
The Body Shop employs around 2,200 people in the UK, including 750 staff at its head office.
The cuts would ""help re-energise"" the brand, the administrators said.
The stores immediately affected include four in London, where rents and other overheads are highest. The chain's remaining shops and the website will trade as normal as the restructuring proceeds.
""It is expected that at the conclusion of the restructuring, more than half of The Body Shop's 198 UK stores will remain open,"" said the administrator, FRP Advisory.
It is understood that The Body Shop's global franchises in the Middle East, Asia, Africa and the rest of Europe are not affected by closures.
The Body Shop stores closing on Tuesday are:
The UK arm of The Body Shop was put into administration last week, a couple of months after it was bought up by Aurelius, a German private equity firm.
Consumer expert Kate Hardcastle, who spent time with The Body Shop founder Dame Anita Roddick, said the closures were a stark reminder of the current ""volatile"" retail landscape.
""However, relevance is equally crucial. A brand must evolve with its audience. The challenge lies not just in upholding these values but in communicating them effectively to a generation that demands authenticity and action,"" she said.
FRP said: ""A reduced store footprint, will coincide with a renewed focus on the brand's products, online sales channels and wholesale strategies.""
Staff headcount at the head office in London will be reduced by approximately 40%, as part of a ""more nimble, financially viable model"" following the earlier sale of loss-making businesses in mainland Europe and parts of Asia.
The Body Shop's Ambassador Programme, which allows representatives to sell the firm's products directly to customers, will also close, FRP said.
The retailer has already announced that its original direct selling network, The Body Shop at Home, which operated for 30 years, will close this month.
Aurelius bought The Body Shop for £207m at the end of last year from Brazilian beauty giant Natura.
But the private equity firm said the chain's performance over the festive period was ""worse than [their] worst-case assumptions"", prompting the move to call in administrators.
It is the first major retail failure in the UK this year.
Aurelius is The Body Shop's main secured creditor - meaning it is first in line to receive payments from the company as it is restructured. As a result, it is also considered to be in pole position to take back control of the retailer.
Retail analyst Natalie Berg said the closure was a ""reminder of the dangers of complacency"".
""The Body Shop was once a trailblazer, but they've settled into the status quo. Standing still is the most dangerous thing you can do in retail. You have to continuously evolve in order to stay relevant to customers. If you don't, someone else certainly will,"" she said.
The Body Shop was founded by the pioneering British businesswoman and activist Dame Anita Roddick and her husband in 1976, and quickly established itself as a ground breaking ethical, sustainable brand - rejecting animal testing on cosmetics, and promoting environmentally-friendly products and ethical sourcing practices.
However, since then it has faced increasing competition, in particular from High Street rival Lush which was co-founded by Mark Constantine who used to be a supplier to The Body Shop.
In 2006, Dame Anita and her husband sold The Body Shop to French beauty giant L'Oreal, which some of its original customer base viewed as a sell-out.
Later its adoption of aggressive sales tactics, including ferocious discounting, put people off paying full prices for its products.

2024-03-06T13:54:40.000Z,What does the Budget mean for you and your money?,BBC News,"The theatre of Budget day may have allowed Chancellor Jeremy Hunt to set the stage for an election, by announcing major tax and spending plans.
It is the finer details of his script that could have a significant impact on your finances, so here is what his plans mean for you.
The chancellor's big play to the audience was a cut in the rate of National Insurance (NI) paid by 27 million employees across the UK. A fixed percentage of the money you earn from your wages is deducted in NI.
January saw the first cut in Class 1 National Insurance for employees since at least 1975, according to available data, or possibly ever. Just three months later, there will be another one.
For employees paid between £12,571 to £50,270 a year, the current NI rate is 10% on earnings (down from 12% before January) and 2% on earnings above that. The chancellor said this would fall to 8% in April.
Someone earning £25,000 a year will save another £249 a year from the latest change. Higher earners will take home an additional £754 a year, according to calculations by investment companies.
For the self-employed, Class 4 NI contributions on all earnings between £12,570 and £50,270 were already due to be cut from a rate of 9% to 8% in April. Mr Hunt said that would now go down to 6%.
Existing government policy means income tax thresholds have been frozen since 2021, and will remain so until at least 2028. That means any kind of pay rise could drag you into a higher tax bracket, or will see a greater proportion of your income taxed than would otherwise be expected.
Normally, those thresholds are expected to rise in line with prices - so economists point out this has been the equivalent of £40bn tax rise.
The UK's official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), has estimated as a result of the policy, 3.7 million more people will be paying income tax and 2.7 million will move into the higher bracket by 2028.
The effect of the combined 4p cut in NI and the threshold freezes from 2021 would mean that only those on £26,000 to £60,000 a year are better off in the next year, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies.
Some councils have faced severe financial pressures, leading the majority to plan cuts to local services. Outside of Scotland (where it is frozen until 2025), they will raise council tax in April.
Councils in England have until 11 March to decide by how much. Those with social care duties can raise council tax by up to 4.99%, without triggering a referendum. Others can increase it by up to 2.99%.
Some can increase bills by more than 5%, with government permission, such as Birmingham where council tax will rise by 21% in two years.
Proposed increases vary from 3% to 16% in Wales, and between 4% and nearly 10% in domestic rates in Northern Ireland.
VAT - a tax added when you buy most goods and services - is unchanged.

The point at which child benefit is withdrawn will now be at a higher level of earnings.
Instead of starting to lose child benefit once at least one parent earns over £50,000 a year, it will be £60,000. It will be taken away entirely from £80,000 a year, rather than £60,000.
The benefit is worth £24 a week for one child and £15.90 for each additional child. Those amounts are due to rise to £25.60 and £16.95 a week in April.
Overall, the government estimates 485,000 families will gain an average of £1,260 in child benefit in 2024-25 as a result, and 170,000 will avoid having to pay any back.
By April 2026, the plan is to move it to a system of household income, not that of individuals.
Direct payments to people receiving benefits, pensioners and some with disabilities have been a lifeline for many in dealing with high prices and bills.
With the cost of domestic gas and electricity falling in April, no plans for any further cost-of-living payments were announced.
However, there was new funding for the Household Support Fund, which councils used to help those in need pay for essentials or have a warm place to go. This will be extended for another six months, having been due to end this month. Councils had called for two more years.
The £90 fee for debt relief orders, which helps some people write-off debts, will be abolished - although some had received grants for that. The repayment period for people on universal credit to pay back budgeting loans has risen from 12 to 24 months.
Fuel duty is a tax motorists pay when buying fuels such as petrol and diesel.
It has been frozen since 2011, and this will continue. In fact, Mr Hunt extended a 5p-a-litre fuel duty cut, which was due to end this month, for a further year - keeping it at 53p a litre and saving the average car driver an estimated £50 next year.
These so-called sin taxes will go up in time, and this time they will include a new duty on vaping.
Vaping products are already subject to value added tax (VAT). From October 2026, they will attract a separate levy. Duty on cigarettes will go up at the same time.
The cost of drinking will not rise, as the freeze on alcohol duty will be extended to February next year.
A new tax-free Individual Savings Account (Isa) will be available to savers. The money invested will be directed to British businesses.
Savers will be allowed to save £5,000 a year into the British Isa, on top of the existing Isa allowance of £20,000. No start date has been announced.
National Savings and Investments (NS&I) will offer British Savings Bonds for savers willing to lock their money away for three years in April. The interest rate is yet to be set.
The government is already clamping down on holiday lets.
Now, in addition, the chancellor will scrap various tax breaks for holiday let owners. For example, there are allowances for furniture and the like which will go.
The higher rate of property capital gains tax will fall from 28% to 24% in April. That will benefit some people who sell a property which is not their home.
This is used by people who live in the UK, but whose principal home for tax purposes is elsewhere.
Non-domiciled people only pay UK tax on money earned in the UK. However, this status will be scrapped from April 2025 and replaced with a new system, potentially raising UK taxes for such people and raising revenue for the government.
The chancellor announced in the autumn that a range of benefits received by millions of people, such as universal credit, would rise by 6.7% in April, in line with the rate of rising prices (as of September).
Benefits are fully devolved in Northern Ireland, but changes will be similar to those for the rest of the UK.
The state pension, as previously announced, will go up by 8.5% in April, which means it will be worth:
We also knew that the National Living Wage for over-23s - paid by employers - will rise from £10.42 an hour to £11.44 an hour in April, with increases for younger workers too.

2024-02-06T17:05:37.000Z,NatWest may 'tell Sid' to buy shares in June,BBC News,"The sale of shares in NatWest to the general public could happen as early as June, UK Government Investments (UKGI) has confirmed.
The Treasury still owns 35% of the bank since it bailed it out to the tune of £46bn during the 2008 financial crisis.
But UKGI, the company responsible for government investments, has been exploring a share sale since the chancellor announced plans last year.
Jeremy Hunt has said any sale would need to achieve ""full value for money"".
On Tuesday, Holger Vieten, who is in charge of selling the government's shares in NatWest, told MPs on the Treasury Select Committee that the process ""potentially could happen"" as early as June.
""The very earliest could be around summer time, but we don't have an exact date,"" the UKGI director said.
Since NatWest, previously known as Royal Bank of Scotland, was bailed out in 2008, the government has been gradually reducing its shareholding in the bank. Shares have so far been sold to institutional investors and back to NatWest itself.
The government said early in 2023 that it wanted to sell its remaining stake in the bank by 2025 or 2026, and in his Autumn Statement in November Mr Hunt said he wanted to explore options for a share offering aimed at the general public.
The chancellor referenced the 1986 ""Tell Sid"" advertising campaign, in which characters urged each other to ""tell Sid"" about the chance to buy shares in British Gas.
The move prompted hundreds of thousands of people to buy shares in the energy firm, one of several companies privatised under former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s.
Mr Vieten said UKGI had hired advisers, including legal and banking experts, to work out options for a share sale before a proposal would be presented to ministers to decide on.
He said there were several ""windows"" for a retail offer, but added the company had not come to any firm conclusions.
""It's very much a work in progress,"" he said.
MPs also raised the fact that NatWest has still not appointed a permanent chief executive following the high-profile resignation of Dame Alison Rose after a row over the closure of former UKIP leader Nigel Farage's bank account.
Dame Alison quit in July last year after admitting she made a mistake in speaking about Mr Farage's relationship with the bank, and her successor Paul Thwaite was only handed the reins for an initial 12-month period.
""I think they need to provide clarity to the market on their proposals around either confirming the interim chief executive or a process around appointing a permanent chief executive for the market to be comfortable,"" said Charles Donald, chief executive of UKGI.
The BBC understands the process of appointing a permanent chief executive is under way.
Richard Haythornthwaite is also to succeed Sir Howard Davies as NatWest Group chairman in April.

The company, which employs about 10,000 people, said discussions with ""interested parties"" were ongoing and ""constructive"".
Reports suggest the firm is looking for a buyer, and that it could call in administrators if one is not found.
Yodel said its ""operations continue without any disruption"".
The firm is owned by the Barclay family and one of its largest clients is online retailer Very, which is also owned by the Barclays.
On Wednesday, Sky reported that the Barclay family was urgently seeking a buyer for Yodel, with The Delivery Group among the possible suitors.
The BBC has approached the Barclays for comment.
A Yodel spokesperson said: ""In the summer of 2023, following a number of unsolicited approaches, we hired advisers to carry out a full strategic review.
""The company has continued to engage with interested parties regarding strategic options for Yodel. We can confirm that these discussions are ongoing, constructive and are in the final stages.""
An earlier statement from Yodel had said that it had ""a number of parties looking to acquire the business"".
The Telegraph reported that insolvency specialists Teneo have been lined up if the business is to be put into administration. Teneo has declined to comment.
Yodel is one of the biggest courier companies in the UK. Last year, it delivered 191 million parcels, with revenues up 3.4%.
However, last year Citizens Advice rated Yodel as the joint worst of the largest five UK courier firms. Along with Evri, it was given an overall score of two points out of five.
According to Yodel's website the company works with retailers such as Zara, JD Sports and John Lewis, although the BBC understands that the firm only delivers a small percentage of John Lewis goods.
Retail analyst Catherine Shuttleworth told the BBC that the market for delivering parcels was ""incredibly competitive, it's really cut-throat"".
""Yodel have got stuck in a place where they're a small player in what has become a very, very big market,"" she said.
However, if Yodel left the market she does not think retailers will have a problem finding alternative couriers.
""They'll swap to an alternative supplier, the market is full of them. They'll very easily shift their volume to somebody else.""
The Barclay family's finances have come under focus after the Telegraph and the Spectator magazine were put up for sale last year by Lloyds Banking Group.
The bank seized the titles from the Barclays as it sought to recover £1.1bn it was owed.
The family repaid the debt using funds from the United Arab Emirates, effectively ending the auction for the Telegraph.
However, the complex nature of the arrangement has led the government to launch an inquiry into the deal.
Michael Lynch, a partner at law firm DMH Stallard and insolvency and business restructuring specialist, said: ""With the Barclay family finances coming under scrutiny, it may be that Yodel's lenders are applying pressure for a refinance or exit.
""Though Yodel's business may be ostensibly positive, if creditor pressure is mounting and a usual business sale is not forthcoming then, as time goes by, options will become more and more limited.""
Ms Shuttleworth said that ultimately she thought that competitors would choose the more viable parts of Yodel's business, ""but they'll wait to see what happens"".
""I don't think it is a business that can continue in one piece but it could be broken up and their competitors will buy parts of it to fit in to their existing networks.""

2024-02-22T13:43:09.000Z,Lloyds sets aside £450m for car finance probe,BBC News,"Banking giant Lloyds has set aside £450m to cover the potential cost of an investigation into car finance deals by the UK's financial regulator.
A probe into whether people had been paying too much for cars was launched by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) last month.
Brokers who arranged car financing earned commission on the interest rates that they set for customers.
Lloyds revealed the provision as it announced a big rise in annual profits.
The bank said pre-tax profits jumped to £7.5bn last year, which was higher than expected and up 57% from the year before.
The FCA announced last month that it would investigate whether people who believe they were charged too much for car loans were owed compensation.
Meanwhile, the Financial Ombudsman says it has received 17,000 complaints to date about motor finance commission.
Lloyds is seen as the most exposed of the major banks to any claims, as it owns one of the UK's largest motor finance providers, Black Horse.
Under what were called discretionary commission arrangements, some lenders had allowed car dealers to adjust interest rates on loans, which would improve the commission they received. In short, the higher the interest rate, the higher the commission.
As a result, these deals created an incentive for brokers to increase how much people were charged for their car loan.
In 2021, the FCA banned these arrangements, saying it would collectively save drivers £165m a year.
Last month, the regulator said that about 10,000 people had made complaints to an ombudsman, with ""many more waiting in the wings"".
""If we find widespread misconduct, we will act to make sure people are compensated in an orderly, consistent and efficient way,"" the FCA said at the time.
The amount that Lloyds eventually pays to cover compensation could be higher or lower than the initial amount it has set aside.
The potential cost of compensation has raised comparisons to the amount paid out during the payment protection insurance (PPI) mis-selling scandal, which cost banks tens of billions of pounds.
But Lloyds' chief financial officer, William Chalmers, told reporters that the car finance probe was ""not like prior remediations"".
Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, Lloyds chief executive Charlie Nunn said: ""The extent of any misconduct or loss on behalf of customers, if any, remains very unclear so we welcome the FCA's announcement a few weeks ago to look into this to provide clarity for customers and the industry.""
Matt Britzman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the £450m set aside by the bank was ""less than some had feared but there will be question marks around how Lloyds has come to that figure"".
""Lloyds has been honest in saying the outcome of the review is largely unknown,"" he added. ""What we do know is that Lloyds is one of the more exposed banks should the FCA deem there was misconduct and customer loss.""
Lloyds also said in its annual report that it was the subject of another investigation by the financial watchdog, looking at the group's compliance with money-laundering rules and regulations.
It said it was fully complying with the investigation, although it could not say whether or not it would have an impact on its finances yet.
The FCA declined to comment on the investigation.
Separately, Mr Nunn also said that Lloyds - which also owns the Halifax, Bank of Scotland and Scottish Widows brands - was predicting the UK's economy would see ""lowish"", but positive, growth this year
While he said the economy was resilient, he added that some customers were ""struggling to make ends meet, whether it's those who are struggling with some of the cost of inflation or alternatively the higher mortgage costs"".
Like other UK banks, Lloyds' profits have been helped by the increase in interest rates over the past couple of years, which have allowed lenders to charge more on loans while not significantly increasing payouts to savers.
Lloyds said its underlying net interest income, which is the difference between the money it charges for loans and pays out for savings, rose 5% to £13.8bn.
Claims for compensation can be made if you bought a motor vehicle on finance before 28 January 2021 and the finance provider and car dealer had a discretionary commission arrangement.

2024-03-13T13:25:48.000Z,Metro Bank scraps seven-day a week opening and cuts jobs,BBC News,"Metro Bank is to end seven-day trading in all its branches and cut about 1,000 jobs after reporting huge losses.
From 29 March, all 76 branches will close on Sundays and Bank Holidays, with more than half of them closing on Saturdays as well.
The lender also said it would cut 22% of its workforce by mid-April as part of a huge cost-cutting exercise.
The struggling High Street bank began a review of operations last autumn in an effort to save about £50m a year.
But on Wednesday Metro Bank said it was looking to cut another £30m by the end of 2024, which would lead to further job losses.
Chief executive David Frumkin said not all the additional cost savings would come from more job losses, but said ""inevitably some will have to come from colleague costs"".
Mr Frumkin said even though branches would no longer be open every day Metro Bank would ""still be open more hours than other competitors on the High Street"".
It does not intend to close any branches and has plans to open about 11 more branches, mainly in the North of England.
The changes come as part of an overhaul, confirmed as the struggling lender reported a £16.9m underlying loss for 2023 - although this was less than the £50.6m seen the year before.
It was launched in the wake of the financial crisis and was the first High Street bank to open in the UK in more than 100 years.
Its founder, American businessman Vernon Hill, said at the time that he wanted to do things differently so the bank offered customer-friendly perks, even putting out water bowls and dog biscuits for customers' pets.
But following a review launched last November, the group has now said that the bulk of its branches, 44 sites, will only be open five days a week, from Monday to Friday, 09:30 to 17:00.
The remaining 32 stores will be open six days a week, from 09:30 to 17:00 on Monday to Friday, and 11:00 to 16:00 on Saturdays.
At present Metro Bank branches open from 08:30 until 18:00 from Monday to Saturday and 11:00 to 17:00 on Sunday.

2024-02-15T02:10:48.000Z,Japan unexpectedly slips into a recession,BBC News,"Japan has unexpectedly fallen into a recession after its economy shrank for two quarters in a row.
The country's gross domestic product (GDP) contracted by a worse-than-expected 0.4% in the last three months of 2023, compared to a year earlier.
It came after the economy shrank by 3.3% in the previous quarter.
The figures from Japan's Cabinet Office also indicate that the country has lost its position as the world's third-largest economy to Germany.
Economists had expected the new data to show that Japan's GDP grew by more than 1% in the fourth quarter of last year.
The latest figures were the first reading of Japan's economic growth for the period and could still be revised.
Two quarters in a row of economic contraction are typically considered the definition of a technical recession.
In October, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecast that Germany was likely to overtake Japan as the world's third-largest economy when measured in US dollars.
The IMF will only declare a change in its rankings once both countries have published the final versions of their economic growth figures. It began publishing data comparing economies in 1980.
Economist Neil Newman told the BBC that the latest figures show that Japan's economy was worth about $4.2tn (£3.3tn) in 2023, while Germany's was $4.4tn.
This was due to the weakness of the Japanese currency against the dollar and that if the yen recovers, the country could regain the number three spot, Mr Newman added.
At a press conference in Tokyo this month, the IMF's deputy head, Gita Gopinath, also said an important reason for Japan potentially slipping in the rankings was the yen falling by about 9% against the US dollar last year.
However, the weakness of the yen has helped to boost the share prices of some of Japan's biggest companies as it makes the country's exports, such as cars, cheaper in overseas markets.
This week, Tokyo's main stock index, the Nikkei 225, crossed the 38,000 mark for the first time since 1990, when a collapse in property prices triggered an economic crisis. The Nikkei 225's record high of 38,915.87 was set on 29 December 1989.
The latest GDP data may also mean that the country's central bank may further delay a much-anticipated decision to raise the cost of borrowing.
The Bank of Japan introduced a negative interest rate in 2016 as it tried to boost spending and investment.
Negative rates make the yen less attractive to global investors, which has pushed down the currency's value.

2024-02-29T15:54:26.000Z,Ocado warns M&S of legal action over food deal,BBC News,"Ocado has warned it may take legal action against M&S if the retailer does not hand over a final payment for their online food joint venture.
The grocery technology firm and M&S signed a deal nearly five years ago for Ocado to sell the retailer's food on the internet.
M&S made an upfront payment of more than £560m and is due to pay £190.7m based on certain targets being met.
However, it is claiming that Ocado has not reached those goals.
Ocado's co-founder and chief executive, Tim Steiner, said that the company believes ""we have a very solid case to get full payment, we know that M&S may not entirely share that view "".
A spokesperson for M&S said: ""M&S remains committed to the turnaround strategy for Ocado Retail and our focus is on working with them and Ocado Group to deliver it.
""On the specific issue of the contractual contingency payment, our advice is that the financial performance of Ocado Retail means the criteria for the performance payment was not met.""
On Thursday, Mr Steiner said: ""We would much rather solve this in a nice and constructive way, which is what we're working towards doing.""We are very confident that we are owed a substantial sum of money and ultimately I hope we will never get there but we will not walk away from that sum of money.""
The joint venture is owned 50:50 by Ocado and M&S. The deal was signed in early 2019 and went live the following year in September during the Covid pandemic when lockdown measures forced more people to shop online for food.
In Ocado's full-year results, which were announced on Thursday, the company made a provision of £28m for the payment. Under accountancy rules, a business is required to show the ""fair value"" of an asset or liability.
But Mr Steiner told reporters that the £28m estimated valuation of the payment from M&S was ""ludicrously low"".
In Ocado's results, it said the sum ""is significantly lower than the amount that Ocado believes it will receive in the future - either via a formal litigation process or settlement"".
Ocado admitted that its retail business had failed to meet the performance measures in the last financial year that would have triggered the automatic payment of the money from M&S, which is due this August.
But it said that ""the contractual arrangement with M&S expressly provides for the target to be adjusted for certain Ocado Retail management decisions or actions"".
For the year to 3 December, Ocado Retail reported sales of £2.4bn, up from £2.2bn in the previous year. The retail division generates the vast majority of the company's group revenue.
The Ocado group as a whole reported a pre-tax loss of £403m compared a loss of £500m in the previous year.
Ocado said that its retail division had grown the number of active customers and value of the average basket also rose, but people were buying fewer goods.
The number of items per basket fell by 4.5% to 44 as ""customers managed their overall basket spend in the current high inflation environment"".

2024-02-07T10:26:56.000Z,Pret A Manger is converting last few all-veggie outlets,BBC News,"Sandwich chain Pret A Manger is abandoning the idea of vegetarian-only outlets, saying people are buying veggie options at all its branches.
The final three Veggie Pret stores, in London and Manchester, will switch to normal Prets by the end of this month.
The specialist outlets, first launched eight years ago, were no longer needed, the company said.
""Every Pret is a Veggie Pret shop,"" said Katherine Bagshawe, UK food and coffee director at Pret A Manger.
One in every three main meals sold was now vegetarian or vegan, she said.
The veggie stores had acted as an ""innovation hub"" Pret added, launching new products including most recently a ""VLT"" sandwich which replaces the bacon in a traditional BLT with mushroom ""rashers"" and a Thai-inspired sticky mushroom Banh Mi baguette and meatless meatballs.
There has been a huge rise in interest in vegan and vegetarian food in recent years, prompted by both health considerations and concerns over the impact of greenhouse gas emissions from meat and dairy production.
However, producers of meat-substitutes have run into difficulties over the last year as they fought for space in a crowded market and there are other signs that the boom in specialist vegan products could be losing steam. A vegan restaurant, in Macclesfield, said earlier this month it would start selling meat products saying it was ""very difficult to stay in business"" selling only vegan food.
Pret first launched its veggie outlets in 2016, helping to boost its image as a vegetarian-friendly brand. Most of the 10 veggie shops were in London, with some in Oxford and Manchester.
But the stores' distinct green frontages began to disappear just six years later, as Pret started to wind down its Veggie-only experiment in the wake of the Covid pandemic.
Pret's post-Covid strategy has been to focus on regional towns and cities outside of London, including recent openings in Bishop's Stortford, Colchester and Worthing.
The last remaining Veggie Prets due to be converted are Broadwich Street and Great Eastern Street in London and its Deansgate store in Manchester.
Pret a manger first opened in 1986, serving sandwiches and other on-the-go lunch products including soups and salads and now has more than 400 UK outlets.
It is owned by JAB holding a German conglomerate which bought it saying it wanted to double the chain's size within five years. It opened 41 new outlets in the UK last year.

2024-02-16T11:25:40.000Z,Household energy bills predicted to fall by nearly £300 a year,BBC News,"Energy bills will fall in April by nearly £300 a year for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity, a leading forecaster says.
Consultancy Cornwall Insight has predicted a 15% drop, taking the typical annual bill to £1,635 - the lowest in more than two years.
The energy price cap for the three months from April will be announced by regulator Ofgem in one week's time.
Many billpayers are still struggling to make payments.
If the prediction proves to be correct, the annual bill for a household, paying by direct debit, would fall by £293 a year compared with the current level of £1,928.
Ofgem's price cap, which will be announced next Friday, affects 29 million households in England, Wales and Scotland. Rules are different in Northern Ireland.
The regulator sets the maximum amount that suppliers can charge for each unit of gas and electricity but not the total bill, so if you use more, you will pay more.
Cornwall Insight's prediction is slightly more positive for billpayers than previous forecasts.
It said a relatively warm winter and less disruption than feared from disruption in the Red Sea had kept wholesale prices, paid by suppliers, at a lower level.
The forecaster said it expected a further fall in bills in July, to about £1,465 a year, followed by a slight rise to £1,524 in October. However, these predictions could change significantly as a result of global events.
""Forecasts show energy bills returning to their lowest levels in over two years, providing a much-needed respite for a nation struggling with a cost of living crisis,"" said Craig Lowrey, principal consultant at Cornwall Insight.
""Fairly healthy gas supply across the Atlantic, coupled with high storage levels in Europe, are helping to keep bills down. But we mustn't get too complacent. Our energy system is still walking a tightrope, and we cannot be sure another political or economic crisis won't send bills straight back up.""
He pointed out though that even with the drop, prices will remain a struggle for many.
Consumers owe an estimated £2.9bn to energy suppliers. Ofgem is proposing lifting the cap by £16 between April and March next year to cover some of these bad debts.

2024-02-18T17:46:57.000Z,Post Office scandal: Kemi Badenoch hits back at ex-chairman,BBC News,"Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch has hit back at claims made by former Post Office chairman Henry Staunton about the reasons for his departure.
Mr Staunton told the Sunday Times that when he was sacked Ms Badenoch had told him: ""Someone's got to take the rap.""
But Ms Badenoch said the comments were a ""disgraceful misrepresentation"" of their conversation.
Mr Staunton also said he was told to delay payouts to Post Office scandal victims, which the government denies.
Hundreds of subpostmasters were prosecuted because of glitches in the Horizon IT system between 1999 and 2015 in what has been called the biggest miscarriage of justice in UK history.
Mr Staunton was appointed Post Office chairman in December 2022, but left the post last month after Ms Badenoch said ""new leadership"" was needed to tackle the scandal.
Speaking to the Sunday Times, Mr Staunton said he first heard about his sacking when he was called by Sky News. He then spoke to Ms Badenoch on the phone.
Mr Staunton also told the paper that shortly after joining the Post Office he was told by a senior civil servant to slow down the rate of compensation payments, apparently to help the government's finances.
""Early on, I was told by a fairly senior person to stall on spend on compensation and on the replacement of Horizon, and to limp, in quotation marks - I did a file note on it - limp into the election,"" he told the paper.
""It was not an anti-postmaster thing, it was just straight financials. I didn't ask, because I said: 'I'm having no part of it - I'm not here to limp into the election, it's not the right thing to do by postmasters'.""
In a lengthy post on X, formerly Twitter, Ms Badenoch said Mr Staunton's comments were a ""disgraceful misrepresentation of my conversation with him and the reasons for his dismissal"".
""Far from 'taking the rap', I dismissed Staunton due to very serious allegations about his conduct while chair of the Post Office, including blocking an investigation into that conduct.
""Henry Staunton had a lack of grip getting justice for postmasters. The serious concerns over his conduct were the reasons I asked him to step down,"" she added.
She said that her conversation with him was carried out with officials and they took a ""complete record"". A statement will be made on Monday ""telling the truth"", she added.
Earlier a spokesman for the government had said it ""utterly"" refuted the claims made by Mr Staunton over stalling compensation payments.
""The government has sped up compensation to victims, and consistently encouraged postmasters to come forward with their claims,"" the spokesman said.
""To suggest any actions or conversations happened to the contrary is incorrect. In fact, upon appointment, Mr Staunton was set concrete objectives, in writing, to focus on reaching settlements with claimants - clear evidence of the government's intent.""
A spokesperson for Mr Staunton told the BBC his client would be making no further comment but that he stood by the accusations made in the Sunday Times.
They also said there was no investigation into Mr Staunton.
Shadow business secretary Jonathan Reynolds said: ""The Horizon scandal is widely accepted to be one of the worst miscarriages of justice in British history.
""Under no circumstances should compensation to victims be delayed and to do so for party political purposes would be a further insult to subpostmasters.
""The Labour Party has called for all subpostmasters to be exonerated and compensation paid swiftly so that victims can begin to draw this awful chapter to a close.""
Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey said Mr Staunton's claims were ""deeply disturbing"" and called for ministers to explain to Parliament ""exactly what has happened at the earliest opportunity"".
The slow pace of overturning convictions and making compensation payments has led some to call for a mass exoneration of those affected.
Mr Staunton told the Sunday Times that Post Office chief executive Nick Read had written to the Justice Secretary Alex Chalk with legal opinion from the Post Office's solicitors, Peters & Peters, that in more than 300 cases convictions were supported by evidence not related to the Horizon software.
""Basically it was trying to undermine the exoneration argument,"" Mr Staunton said. ""It was 'most people haven't come forward because they are guilty as charged' - i.e. think very carefully about exoneration.""
A spokesperson for the Post Office said it was ""very aware of the terrible impact from this appalling scandal and miscarriage of justice"".
""We refute both the assertions put to us and the words and phrases allegedly used, and are focused on supporting the government's plans for faster justice and redress for victims, as well as helping the Inquiry get to the truth of what happened,"" they said.
The spokesperson added: ""In no sense did the Post Office seek to persuade government against mass exoneration. We remain firmly committed to supporting faster justice and redress for victims"".

2024-03-07T12:25:57.000Z,Energy bills: What can I do if I can't afford to pay?,BBC News,"Energy prices will fall in April, but many households will still struggle to pay their bills.
Some will need to repay debt to suppliers and many will worry about future levels of financial support.
From April, energy bills will fall by more than 12% for most people in England, Scotland and Wales.
Energy regulator Ofgem recently announced the average household paying for dual fuel by direct debit will pay £1,690 a year.
That's a drop of £238 (or about £20 a month) from the previous energy price cap - the maximum amount suppliers can charge for each unit of gas and electricity used.
It's the lowest level in more than two years, a period when energy prices soared due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
About 5.3m people in Great Britain are in debt to their energy supplier, research by Citizens Advice suggests.
The charity says 1.7m people lost connection at least once a month in 2023 because they couldn't afford to top up their prepayment meter.
Its survey found that 800,000 people went more than 24 hours without gas and electricity because they couldn't afford to top up.
It estimated that 2m people would lose their power supply for the same reason between January and March 2024.
Under Ofgem rules, your supplier must work with you to agree a payment plan.
If you don't agree one,they might try to force you to have prepayment meter installed or switch an existing smart meter to prepayment mode.
In very rare cases, if you haven't paid a bill after 28 days, you might be threatened with disconnection.
If you've reached state pension age, your supplier can't disconnect you between 1 October and 31 March if you either:
Suppliers can pass your details to a debt collection agency - and you might be charged more to cover the cost of this.
Many suppliers also charge extra fees for late payments.
Non-payment could also damage your credit rating and make it harder to borrow money in the future.
Suppliers can install a prepayment meter without a household's permission - but only if they meet certain requirements.
These were brought in after an investigation by The Times found debt agents acting for British Gas wrongly broke into vulnerable people's homes to fit meters.
The rules mean suppliers must give customers more opportunity to clear their debts, contacting them at least 10 times before installing a meter. They also have to conduct a ""site welfare visit"".
Meters cannot be fitted for:
About four million households had a prepayment meter in July 2023, according to Ofgem.
Prepayment meters used to be more expensive than paying by direct debit but the charges are now the same.
If you are struggling to pay your energy bills, you need to contact your supplier.
You can ask for a review of your payments and debt repayments, payment breaks or reductions, more time to pay and access to hardship funds.
If eligible you could be added to a list of households entitled to extra support, the Priority Services Register.
It doesn't cancel your debts but it does show that you are vulnerable, which your supplier should take into account.
Ofgem also recommends asking your supplier to add you to the Network Operator Register, if you rely on energy for medical reasons.
Make sure you are claiming relevant benefits and government help. You can check the MoneyHelper benefits guide or use the Entitledto and Turn2us benefits calculators.
Pensioners, people on certain disability benefits, and households on means-tested benefits, can get help with energy bills.
Councils can offer help through the Household Support Fund, which has been extended for six months from March 2024.
Finally, adjusting settings on your boiler can save money.

2024-02-19T23:12:06.000Z,Row deepens between Kemi Badenoch and ex-Post Office chair,BBC News,"A row has deepened between Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch and the Post Office chair she sacked, after he said he had been told to delay compensation payments for sub-postmasters.
Henry Staunton said he had been told to stall payouts to allow the government to ""limp into the election"", apparently to help state finances.
But Ms Badenoch said the claims were ""completely false"" and accused him of spreading ""made-up anecdotes"".
Mr Staunton has stood by his comments.
The row first erupted at the weekend when the former Post Office chair said in an interview with the Sunday Times that he was told by a senior civil servant to slow down compensation payments to postmasters.
Between 1999 and 2015, hundreds of sub-postmasters and postmistresses were wrongly prosecuted after a faulty computer system called Horizon made it look like money was missing from their branches.
Some sub-postmasters wrongfully went to prison, many were financially ruined. Some have since died.
The government has promised to quash convictions and pay compensation, but concerns have been raised over the speed and complexity in victims securing financial redress, with just 33 claims fully settled out of the 938 postmasters convicted.
Mr Staunton, who has been on boards of companies ranging from ITV to WH Smith, was appointed as chair of the Post Office in December 2022, but was dismissed by Ms Badenoch last month.
At the time she told the BBC she removed him after concerns about Post Office governance and ""the entire business model"", and said ""it just wasn't working"".
Mr Staunton subsequently told this weekend's Sunday Times that early on in his role, ""I was told by a fairly senior person to stall on spend on compensation and on the replacement of Horizon, and to limp, in quotation marks - I did a file note on it - limp into the election.
""It was not an anti-postmaster thing, it was just straight financials,"" he said. ""I didn't ask, because I said: 'I'm having no part of it - I'm not here to limp into the election, it's not the right thing to do by postmasters'.""
His comments prompted a critical response from Ms Badenoch on social media on Sunday, before the business secretary made a statement to the House of Commons on Monday in which she said Mr Staunton's claims were ""completely false"" and ""a blatant attempt to seek revenge following dismissal"".
""There would be no benefit to us whatsoever of us delaying compensation,"" she added. ""This does not have any significant impact on revenues whatsoever - it would be a mad thing to even suggest.""
She said there was ""no evidence whatsoever"" that Mr Staunton was told by an official to stall payouts, later adding: ""Actually if such a thing was said, it is for Mr Staunton himself to bring the evidence.""
In response to Ms Badenoch, a statement for Mr Staunton said he stood by the comment and that he had ""recorded at the time in a file note which he emailed to himself and to colleagues and which is therefore traceable on the Post Office server"".
""Mr Staunton is not in the habit of resorting to fabrication or invention and decided to go public out of a desire to ensure that the public were fully aware of the facts surrounding the multiple failures that have led to postmasters in this country being badly let down,"" the statement added.
Mr Staunton himself said it was in the interests of the Post Office to speed up ""progress on exoneration and that compensation for wrongly convicted postmasters was more generous, but we didn't see any real movement"" until after an ITV drama depicting the scandal aired earlier this year.
""We will leave it to others to come to the conclusion as to why that was the case,"" he added.
Mr Staunton also claimed that when he was sacked, Ms Badenoch had told him: ""Someone's got to take the rap.""
The Post Office told the BBC it would not be appropriate to comment ""on confidential emails that allegedly may or may not have been sent"".
The government has denied the claims about delaying compensation and Ms Badenoch told MPs the reason she dismissed Mr Staunton was ""because there were serious concerns about his behaviour as chair, including those raised from other directors on the board"".
""While he was in post a formal investigation was launched into allegations made regarding Mr Staunton's conduct, this included serious matters such as bullying,"" she added, saying that concerns were also raised about his willingness to co-operate with the investigation.
Ms Badenoch said it was ""so disappointing that he's chosen to spread a series of falsehoods, provide made-up anecdotes to journalists and leak discussions held in confidence"".
In response to the bullying allegations, a spokesman for Mr Staunton said it was ""the first time the existence of such allegations have been mentioned"".
""Mr Staunton is not aware of any aspect of his conduct which could give rise to such allegations,"" a statement added.
""They were certainly not raised by the secretary of state at any stage and certainly not during the conversation which led to Mr Staunton's dismissal.
""Such behaviour would in any case be totally out of character.""
Late on Monday, a copy of a readout of the phone call to dismiss Mr Staunton on 27 January was published. It noted that the business secretary had received a briefing on ""the governance issues at the Post Office"" and that the complaints against Mr Staunton were ""so serious"" that the government needed to intervene.
The readout did not contain the specific words ""someone's got to take the rap"", but Mr Staunton said he stood by ""his characterisation of the conversation"".
One former sub-postmaster, Christopher Head, said the row was a distraction that the Horizon victims did not need.
""We just want to be delivered full and fair compensation that's been promised, and as we're seeing on the ground that's just simply not happening for us,"" he told BBC News.
Jonathan Reynolds, Labour's shadow business secretary, said there were now ""two completely contrasting accounts, one from the former chair of the Post Office and one from the secretary of state"".
""Only one of these accounts can be the truth,"" he said. ""What we need now is transparency and scrutiny.""
Liam Byrne, Labour MP and the chair of the Business and Trade Committee, earlier told the BBC he had approached Mr Staunton to attend a session next week.
The committee will be hearing evidence from Post Office chief executive Nick Read and Alan Bates, the former sub-postmaster whose battle against the Post Office inspired the recent ITV drama into the scandal and thrust it back into the spotlight.

2024-02-08T07:43:52.000Z,Disney boss bets future on Taylor Swift and Fortnite,BBC News,"Disney's chief executive, Bob Iger, has announced a series of moves which he hopes will bring ""significant growth"" to the entertainment giant.
The plans include streaming an exclusive version of Taylor Swift's Eras Tour concert movie on Disney+.
The firm will also invest $1.5bn (£1.2bn) in Epic Games, the maker of the hugely popular video game Fortnite.
Disney has been under pressure from activist investor Nelson Peltz, who has called for a shakeup of the business.
The US billionaire wants Disney to boost profits from its streaming business as well as improve the box office performance of its films. Last year, a number of Disney films, including those from its Marvel franchise, failed to ignite the global box office.
In its results for the three months to 31 December, Disney said that its streaming service had shed 1.3 million subscribers following a price increase in October.
However, Disney still expects its streaming business to reach profitability by September this year.
The deal with Epic means gamers will be able to interact with Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars and Avatar characters.
""This marks Disney's biggest entry ever into the world of games and offers significant opportunities for growth and expansion,"" Mr Iger said.
The announcements come a day after the company unveiled a joint venture with rivals Fox and Warner Bros. Discovery to launch a new sports streaming platform.
Together, the three US media giants own a wide range of sports rights including the FIFA World Cup, Formula 1, National Football League, National Basketball Association and Major League Baseball.
Mr Iger also unveiled plans to buy back $3bn worth of shares from investors. In its results, Disney reported flat revenues at $23.5bn but a rise in pre-tax profits to $2.8bn from $1.7bn in the comparable quarter.
Asked whether the announcements would be enough to satisfy Mr Peltz, who wants a seat on Disney's board, Mr Iger told CNBC: ""The last thing that we need right now is to be distracted in terms of our time, our energy, by an activist or activists that, frankly, have a completely different agenda, and don't understand our company, its assets, even the essence of the Disney brand.""
But a spokesperson for Mr Peltz's Trian Fund Management firm said: ""It's déjà vu all over again. We saw this movie last year and we didn't like the ending.""
Disney shares rose by more than 6% in extended trading in New York after the announcements.
Mr Iger previously headed Disney for 15 years before retiring at the end of 2021 but made a shock return to the firm less than a year after stepping down.
He was brought back after the company's share price plummeted and Disney+ continued to make a loss.
Separately, Disney is facing a lawsuit from actress Gina Carano who was sacked in 2021 over a social media post in which she compared being a Republican to being a Jew during the Holocaust.
The lawsuit is being funded by Elon Musk, who made an open call on his platform X, formerly known as Twitter, for others to join the suit.

2024-02-19T03:17:23.000Z,Lunar New Year: China tourism spending tops pre-Covid level,BBC News,"Tourism spending in China during the Lunar New Year break jumped above pre-Covid levels, official data shows.
Domestic tourism spending hit 632.7 billion yuan (£69.7bn), about 47% more compared to the same holiday period last year according to government figures.
The celebrations came after years of pandemic lockdowns and restrictions, which were lifted in early 2023.
The data was also boosted as the holiday was a day longer than usual.
The figures for the start of the Year of the Dragon showed that 474m domestic trips were taken during the eight-day break, which ended on Sunday. That was more than 34% higher than last year and 19% above pre-pandemic levels in 2019.
Although authorities did not give a breakdown of the data, calculations based on the official figures show that average spending on each trip was down by around 9.5% compared to 2019.
This suggests ""consumption downgrading is still widely seen,"" analysts from US investment banking giant Goldman Sachs wrote in a note.
The holiday, known as the Spring Festival in China, is the world's largest annual migration.
Traditionally, hundreds of millions of people return to their hometowns in China to reunite with family members, or visit tourist attractions across the country.
During the pandemic, major celebrations were cancelled and travel was banned.
The jump in overall Lunar New Year spending marks some rare good news for the world's second-largest economy, which is facing a number of challenges.
Among the serious issues Beijing is grappling with are a property market crisis, weak exports and concerns about falling consumer prices, or deflation.
Meanwhile, official data released on Sunday showed that investment by foreign businesses into China last year increased by the lowest amount for three decades.
The Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) fell to the lowest level since 1993, according to the State Administration of Foreign Exchange.

2024-02-14T13:16:15.000Z,Pressure on renters persists into new year,BBC News,"Financial pressure on renters has continued, official figures show, while analysts say there are tentative signs of activity in the property market.
Tenants paid 6.2% more in rent in January than they did a year earlier, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.
The annual rise was unchanged for the second consecutive month, as demand from tenants kept prices up.
There was a mixed picture in the property market across the UK.
Annual rental rises are running at a high rate, and particularly so in London, where the annual increase was 6.9%, and in Scotland, where it was 6.8%.
Renters have faced stiff competition for properties, just at a time when supply from landlords has been shrinking.
The ONS figures record prices paid, but for those moving to a new tenancy, the increases are likely to be greater.
Many analysts suggest that the pace of increases will slow in the coming months as renters consider any further increases to be unaffordable.
Renters looking to buy a first property may be cheered to see house prices falling. However, mortgage rate reductions, which were moving at pace at the start of the year, have now stalled.
On average, UK house prices fell in the year to December, with the ONS recording a drop of 1.4% which equates to a fall of £4,000. Yet, the picture varies quite noticeably in different parts of the country.
In England, prices were down 2.1%, and they were 2.5% lower over the year in Wales. However, they were up 3.3% in Scotland over the same period.
Figures are collected slightly differently in Northern Ireland, but rose by 1.4% in the final quarter of the year.
Regionally, there were house price increases over the year in the North West of England and the West Midlands, but falls elsewhere in England. London's average house price remains the most expensive of any region in the UK.
Commentators said that wider inflation figures, also published on Wednesday, would mean the Bank of England would not rush to cut benchmark interest rates, so mortgage rates could even increase slightly.
""There are broader challenges on the horizon. We are on the brink of recession, redundancies are on the rise, and there is every chance that life gets tougher before it gets better,"" said Sarah Coles, personal finance analyst at investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown.
""It means buyers need to consider their finances in the round before taking the plunge. Beyond the money saved for your deposit, you need an emergency savings safety net to fall back on in tougher times.""
Jonathan Hopper, chief executive of Garrington Property Finders, said there were ""tentative signs"" of more activity in the housing market among buyers, as price falls had meant some areas looked better value than previously.
While mortgage rates might stall, they were still lower than at the end of last year, he added, giving buyers a little more confidence.

2024-02-23T15:47:05.000Z,Ex-Post Office boss Paula Vennells stripped of CBE,BBC News,"Former Post Office boss Paula Vennells has been formally stripped of her CBE for ""bringing the honours system into disrepute"", according to the Cabinet Office.
Ms Vennells said last month she would hand back her title following the Horizon IT scandal.
Hundreds of sub-postmasters were prosecuted based on faulty data between 1999 and 2015.
Some people went to prison while many were financially ruined.
The scandal has been called the biggest miscarriage of justice in UK history and earlier this year it was thrust back into the spotlight by the broadcast of the ITV drama, Mr Bates vs the Post Office.
Following the drama, more than a million people signed a petition calling for Ms Vennells to be stripped of her CBE before she announced she would be handing it back.
At the time, Ms Vennells, who was Post Office chief executive between 2012 and 2019, said she had ""listened and I confirm that I return my CBE with immediate effect"".
""I am truly sorry for the devastation caused to the sub-postmasters and their families, whose lives were torn apart by being wrongly accused and wrongly prosecuted as a result of the Horizon system,"" she said.
More than 900 sub-postmasters and postmistresses were prosecuted for stealing money because of incorrect information provided by a computer system called Horizon.
The Post Office itself brought many of the cases to court it prosecuted 700 people.
On Thursday, the government set out plans for legislation to clear the names of hundreds of people wrongly convicted in the scandal.
Criticism had been mounting that the current process for overturning convictions and getting compensation was far too slow
Some sub-postmasters caught up in the scandal have died or taken their own lives in the intervening years.
On Friday, the Times reported that 251 postmasters wrongly accused of stealing money from the Post Office have died before receiving compensation.
On Thursday, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, said that ""more questions should have been asked"" about the involvement of Ms Vennells in the Church of England.
Ms Vennells is an ordained Anglican priest and last month sources told the BBC that she had been shortlisted to be Bishop of London in 2017.
In response to a written question to the General Synod, Mr Welby said he was ""not able to confirm or deny whether Ms Vennells was interviewed"" for roles due to confidentiality.
However, he added: ""As has been said more generally about Paula Vennells' involvement in various committees and working groups in the Church of England, by 2019 and 2020, it is clear that more questions should have been asked about the appropriateness of that involvement when more had come to light about the Horizon scandal.""

2024-02-06T19:54:18.000Z,Prime Minister Rishi Sunak claims cost of living pressures starting to ease,BBC News,"The prime minister has claimed that the burden on hard-pressed households is ""starting to ease"".
In a BBC interview, Rishi Sunak said pressures from higher bills or mortgage rates were subsiding.
It comes as eight million people on means-tested benefits will receive their final cost-of-living instalment.
The £299 payment will go directly into bank accounts of those eligible before 22 February without the need to claim.
No further payments of this kind are scheduled and charities are urging the government to consider more support.
However, questions have been raised over whether such payments were the best way to help struggling households.
This payment of £299 is the last of three instalments that totalled £900 that will have been paid within a year.
Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live on Tuesday, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said that he was ""sad"" to hear about parents being so low on money they have been watering down baby formula for their infants.
""But my job is to make sure that we can ease those pressures,"" he said, pointing out that inflation - which measures the pace of prices rises - is now much lower than its peak of 11.1% in October 2022.
""That's why it was important that we prioritised bringing inflation down [...] that will have an impact on people because it will start to ease some of those pressures,"" he said. Although, a drop in global energy prices and the Bank of England's decision to increase interest rates have had the biggest part to play in cooling price rises.
Mr Sunak also said that households were ""starting to see mortgage rates come down"" and the government had given ""meaningful"" tax cuts.
Those on low incomes and receiving benefits such as universal credit are eligible for the cost-of-living payments, but they should be wary of scams in which fraudsters use the opportunity to try to access personal details.
They often purport to be from government bodies. Some are designed to capture financial information.
On legitimate payments, there will be a reference on a recipient's bank account of their National Insurance number, followed by DWP COL, or the reference HMRC COLS for those who are eligible through tax credits.
After this final instalment, no further cost-of-living payments are currently scheduled, with some pressure on Chancellor Jeremy Hunt to announce more support in next month's Budget.
""Our data shows that the cost-of-living payments do offer some respite to people, but this is short-lived. Historically high energy bills, unaffordable housing and other spiralling costs are keeping people in crisis,"" said Morgan Wild, of Citizens Advice.
""The government has responded with temporary support but we need more than quick fixes. Long-term commitments are needed to raise people's incomes and standard of living.""
The prime minister also told 5 Live that the government had provided ""considerable support for the most vulnerable in society... totalling about £100bn"".
He added: ""Taken in the round, there's lots of support for the people who need it.""
David, 77, who lives in Nottingham, said there was not much room for manoeuvre with his finances.
""I'm having to budget carefully for food and clothes. I have to make do with the minimum,"" he said.
""I often wonder how I am going to manage in the long term,""
The government has pointed to a 6.7% rise in benefits and an 8.5% rise in the state pension, as well as an increase in the financial support provided to those on benefits who rent privately, which all come into effect in April.
On Tuesday, Sarah Olney, a Liberal Democrat MP, said: ""If the prime minister thinks people are no longer struggling with the cost of living he must be living on another planet.
""The government could be doing so much more, like reversing their tax cuts for big banks to help those struggling to pay their mortgage keep a roof over their head.""
A committee of MPs also recently questioned whether the cost-of-living payments were sufficient to help those in financial difficulty owing to high bills and prices.
In November, a report by the Work and Pensions Committee said the money only provided a temporary reprieve for some, and may have been better used for increasing benefits instead.
This is not the only cost-of-living payment. More than six million people with disabilities received £150 during last summer. During the winter, over eight million pensioners received an extra payment of up to £300, primarily to help with energy bills.

2024-02-28T06:51:14.000Z,"Apple unplugs self-driving electric car project, reports say",BBC News,"Apple has reportedly cancelled its plans to build electric vehicles (EV) a decade after the iPhone maker was rumoured to be working on the project.
The firm has never publicly acknowledged the project, which involves around two thousand people.
Many employees from the project will be moved to the iPhone maker's artificial intelligence (AI) division, according to Bloomberg News.
Apple did not immediately respond to a BBC request for a comment.
The Apple car team was reportedly known as the Special Projects Group as part of its chief executive Tim Cook's Project Titan.
As it spent billions of dollars on research and development, the company was initially rumoured to be working on a fully autonomous vehicle without a steering wheel and pedals.
The team was understood to still be years away from producing a vehicle.
""This is a smart and long awaited decision,"" Ray Wang, founder and chief executive of Silicon Valley-based consultancy Constellation Research told the BBC.
""The market demand for EVs is not there and AI is where all the action is,"" he added.
Apple has been exploring other opportunities beyond the iPhone and computers, including its recently launched Vision Pro virtual reality headset.
Research firm Counterpoint highlighted that the decision came as the market for AI in consumer electronics is growing sharply.
""Preliminary data suggests shipments of generative AI smartphones will exceed 100 million units in 2024,"" said its senior analyst, Ivan Lam.
Counterpoint predicts that number could hit more than 500 million by 2027.
Demand for EVs has slowed in recent month as borrowing costs remain high, which has made the market increasingly competitive as major players try to win over customers.
In recent months, US motor industry giants Ford and General Motors have postponed plans to expand EV production.
Last week, electric truck maker Rivian announced it would cut its workforce by 10% and said it did not expect any growth in its production this year.
In January, Tesla warned that its sales growth would be weaker this year than in 2023.
The company, which is led by multi-billionaire Elon Musk, has been cutting prices in key markets around the world, including Europe and China, as it faces tough competition from Chinese rivals such as BYD.
Mr Musk responded on the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, to a report that the Apple project was being wound down with emojis of a salute and a cigarette.

2024-02-14T17:12:56.000Z,Deliveroo and Uber Eats riders strike on Valentine's Day,BBC News,"Takeaway delivery drivers are striking on Valentine's Day to demand better pay and improved working conditions.
The action, impacting four food apps including Deliveroo and Uber Eats, is thought to involve as many as 3,000 drivers and riders on Wednesday between 17:00 and 22:00 GMT.
One cyclist taking part told the BBC their pay was ""absolutely ridiculous"".
Deliveroo said rider retention rate was ""high"" and it reviewed pay yearly. Just Eat said its rates were ""competitive"".
The action, organised by a grassroots group of couriers is intended to draw attention to what has been described as poor pay and working conditions many riders face while delivering food and groceries in cities across the UK.
Aside from Deliveroo and Uber Eats, Just Eat and Stuart.com will also be affected, with couriers who normally compete across multiple apps for delivery planning to refuse to take orders.
""Sacrificing a few hours for our rights is essential, instead of continuing to work incessantly for insufficient wages,"" the group Delivery Job UK said on its Instagram page.
""Our request is simple: we want fair compensation for the work we do. We are tired of being exploited and risking our lives every day... It's time for our voices to be heard.""
Diorge, 25, who delivers around south West London, works for two of the involved apps and said he stopped taking orders at 17:00 on Wednesday. He is part of a group of couriers organising the action.
""All we are asking is to be seen as humans and not machines. We are not delivery machines,"" Diorge said in a statement.
""To make the minimum national wage we have to make at least four deliveries, which is not as easy as it seems.""
The action will extend beyond the UK.
In the US, drivers for Uber, Lyft and food delivery firms are also set to halt work for two hours on Wednesday, according to Justice for App Workers, which says it represents more than 130,000 app drivers.
Organisers said members would not be giving any rides to and from the airport in 10 major cities, including Chicago and Miami.
Delivery Job UK claimed its delivery riders were braving the ""cold, rain and absurd distances"" for deliveries paying ""ridiculous values"", ranging from £2.80 to £3.15.
A spokesman for the group told the BBC striking Deliveroo riders wanted an increase to a minimum of £5. The other companies use different pricing structures.
""They [Deliveroo] have lowered their fees. There's no incentive anymore. On a Friday night you could make £100 over 4-5 hours, now that's gone,"" the spokesman said.
He also claimed couriers were exposed to ""a lot of violence on the streets"", especially in the evenings.
Joe, a courier in London since 2018 who plans to strike on Wednesday, said the work was ""incredibly isolating"" and attracted a lot of migrant workers who were unable to challenge the conditions and were ""forced into it"".
""Conditions are shocking,"" he told the BBC. ""The pricing of fees is aggressive. It's hard to overstate how sophisticated these algorithms have become. The fees are absolutely ridiculous.""
Callum Cant, who has written about the gig economy and is a lecturer at Essex University, said changes to fees meant couriers had seen a 40% drop in wages in real terms since 2018.
""With a minimum fee of £2.80, most might only be making three orders an hour, and then they have to subtract their costs too. Some are making £7 an hour, which in London is barely liveable,"" he said.
While delivery drivers are not formally unionised the GMB has an agreement with Deliveroo which, the union has said, is the first of its kind in the food delivery sector.
It includes access to education courses and a pay floor for fees, negotiated each April.
In a statement, Deliveroo said it offered its riders self-employed, flexible work, alongside protections.
""Rider retention rates are high and the overwhelming majority of riders tell us that they are satisfied working with us"", a spokesperson said.
""We are pleased to also be able to offer riders free insurance, sickness cover, financial support when riders become new parents and a range of training opportunities.""
Uber Eats told the BBC it offered a ""flexible way"" for couriers to earn by using its app ""when and where they choose"".
""We know that the vast majority of couriers are satisfied with their experience on the app, and we regularly engage with couriers to look at how we can improve their experience.""
Just Eat said it provided ""a highly competitive base rate to self-employed couriers and also offer regular incentives to help them maximise their earnings"".
""We continue to review our pay structure regularly and welcome any feedback from couriers,"" the company added.
Stuart.com said it also was ""committed to providing competitive earnings opportunities for courier partners"".

2024-02-19T17:52:49.000Z,Currys takeover battle looms as JD.com eyes bid,BBC News,"Currys could be at the centre of a takeover battle after Chinese e-commerce group JD.com said it was considering an offer for the company.
The potential bid emerged after Currys said at the weekend it had rejected a £700m takeover approach from US investment firm Elliott.
JD.com said it was ""in the very preliminary stages"" of evaluating a possible bid for the retailer.
Currys' share price jumped by more than a third to close at 64p on Monday.
The retailer has more than 800 stores globally and employs 28,000 people. In the UK, it operates about 300 stores with 15,000 staff.
Following reports that it was a potential bidder for Currys, JD.com issued a statement saying it was considering an offer, but added there was ""no certainty"" a bid would ultimately be made.
The BBC understands that conversations with JD.com on a possible transaction started towards the end of last year as the Chinese firm looked at options to expand internationally because of weaker demand in its home market.
On Saturday, Currys said it had turned down a takeover approach from Elliot of 62p per share, which would have valued it at about £700m, saying the offer ""significantly undervalued"" the company.
However, reports suggest that Elliott, which bought UK book shop chain Waterstones in 2018, could come back with a higher offer.
Under UK takeover rules, JD.com now has until 18 March to make a formal offer or walk away from the deal. The deadline for Elliot is 16 March.
Currys' share price has fallen by more than a third over the past year and on Friday, before news of the takeover interest, it closed at 47.08p, valuing the business at about £534m.
There is widespread acknowledgement at board level that Currys' share price has long been at a steep discount given its market share and profitability.
Despite this, the board is thought to still be supportive of the current chief executive, Alex Baldock, who has ""made great progress on cutting costs"" according to one insider.
There are some, however, who say that in hindsight the decision to close down 35 airport stores in 2021 - including at Heathrow - was a mistake.
The one constant competitive pressure throughout Currys' various incarnations - which has seen its name change from Dixons to Dixons Carphone then to Currys - has been Amazon.
One former employee told the BBC that it was critical to match Amazon's prices. If not, customers would visit Currys' stores but order from Amazon on their phones.
Its stores in Nordic countries - where it trades under the Elkjøp brand - have also struggled in recent years.
The rising cost of living has hit many retailers as consumers rein in spending, and Currys said last month that underlying sales had fallen 3% over the key Christmas trading period.
Despite this, the company increased its profit forecast for the year, helped by cost cuts and higher profit margins on some of its services.
Emily Salter from GlobalData said that although it had lost share in recent years, it remains the market leader for electrical goods in the UK, ""making it an attractive acquisition proposition"".
As well as selling electrical goods through its stores and online, the previous management team tried to improve Currys' by expanding into installation and support services which has grown into a substantial business.
Revenue from its Care & Repair business - which offers protection, repair, refurbishment and recycling services - is growing. Its iD Mobile virtual mobile network has recorded a 30% rise in subscribers over the past year to 1.6 million.
Last week, analysts at Investec said the Care & Repair business alone could be worth as much as £667m, while mobile business could be valued at about £500m.
Ben Hunt, equity retail analyst at Investec, said the interest in Currys reflected the fact that while ""the news isn't getting any worse"" for many struggling retailers at the moment, with price rises easing and real incomes now improving, share prices remain low in the sector and do not reflect the potential for recovery.
This makes companies such as Currys an ""easy steal"" for private equity firms who are looking to pick up undervalued businesses, he said.
In addition, Currys has ""done a lot of the heavy lifting"" already for any potential suitor, having cut £300m from its annual costs.
Many commentators have said that UK firms are looking undervalued, and Erik Hirsch, co-chief executive of the US private equity firm Hamilton Lane, told the BBC's Today programme: ""I think everyone's looking at the UK more closely.
""Private markets are always looking for value... and today the UK is certainly offering that in places.""

The move will see motion picture production president Sean Bailey stepping down after a decade and a half in the role.
It follows recent disappointing box office performances, including Haunted Mansion and Jungle Cruise.
He will be replaced by David Greenbaum, head of Disney's Searchlight Pictures.
Disney said Mr Bailey will stay at the company as a producer on the upcoming science fiction movie Tron: Ares and other projects.
During his tenure, Mr Bailey oversaw live-action adaptations of Alice in Wonderland, Maleficent and The Jungle Book.
His blockbuster movies also included The Lion King, Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin.
Together his productions brought in an estimated $7bn (£5.5bn) in global box office takings for the media giant.
But last year, he was also responsible for The Little Mermaid which failed to achieve the success of others.
""Sean has been an incredibly important member of the Studio's creative team for well over a decade,"" said Disney Entertainment Co-Chairman Alan Bergman.
""He and his team have brought to the screen iconic stories and moments that have delighted fans around the world and will stand the test of time.""
Mr Greenbaum has been appointed to the newly-created role of president at Disney Live Action and 20th Century Studios.
He was involved in the movie Poor Things, which has gained 11 nominations including best picture, for this year's Oscars.
Disney has been under pressure from activist investor Nelson Peltz, who has called for a shakeup of the business.
The US billionaire wants Disney to boost profits from its streaming business as well as improve the box office performance of its films.
Mr Peltz has repeatedly demanded a seat on Disney's board. On Monday, the firm sent a letter to shareholders urging them not to support his bid to become a board member.
Earlier this month, Mr Iger, announced a series of moves which he hopes will bring ""significant growth"" to the entertainment giant.
The plans include streaming an exclusive version of Taylor Swift's Eras Tour concert movie on Disney+.
The firm will also invest $1.5bn (£1.2bn) in Epic Games, the maker of the hugely popular video game Fortnite.
A day before that announcement, Disney also unveiled a joint venture with rivals Fox and Warner Bros. Discovery to launch a new sports streaming platform.
Together, the three US media giants own a wide range of sports rights including the FIFA World Cup, Formula 1, National Football League, National Basketball Association and Major League Baseball.
Mr Iger previously headed Disney for 15 years before retiring at the end of 2021 but made a shock return to the firm less than a year after stepping down.
He was brought back after the company's share price plummeted and Disney+ continued to make a loss.

2024-02-29T12:40:50.000Z,Housing market shows signs of picking up,BBC News,"Signs of life were seen in the UK housing market in the new year with a rise in the number of mortgages being approved.
Activity remains weak overall, with potential buyers still nervous about high interest rates.
But the latest Bank of England data shows approvals for house purchases rose to 55,200 in January from 51,500 in December.
This was the highest level since October 2022.
Borrowing on credit cards also picked up last month.
People took on £1.9bn more in credit on cards, car finance and other loans in January than they repaid.
Mortgage lenders have been shifting the interest rates charged on home loans at a rapid rate since the start of the year. This started with some significant cuts to the cost of new fixed-rate deals.
However, in recent weeks, these rates have started to creep back up.
Many potential buyers have put plans on hold in the hope that the Bank of England will cut the benchmark interest rate later in the year, which would influence lenders' decisions.
The upheaval over the past year is shown in the Bank's figures, which show homeowners actually repaid more money on mortgages than they took out in new lending in the year to January - the first time this has happened since comparable records began 30 years ago.
This was mainly due to people being reluctant to borrow when mortgage rates were so high during mid-to-late 2023. Mortgage repayments still outstripped new lending by £1.1bn in January.
Separately, property sales at the start of the year were slightly up compared with December, but 12% lower than January last year.
Karim Haji, head of financial Services at KPMG, said: ""While the rise in mortgage approvals offers some green shoots of hope for recovery, the housing market remains weak. With interest rates still relatively high, affordability will remain stretched.""
He said the increase in borrowing on loans and credit cards was a sign of people using their income to pay for Christmas, and then borrowing money to get them through January.
""Households will be looking to the Bank of England and the Budget for a cost-of-living lifeline. And with credit defaults expected to rise further, lenders must ensure customers have the right support to weather the months ahead,"" he said.
The housing market is a major factor in the performance of the UK economy as a whole.

2024-02-08T13:45:49.000Z,Landlord mortgages in arrears double in a year,BBC News,"The number of landlords who have fallen behind on their mortgages has jumped, according to figures from the banking industry.
Buy-to-let mortgages in arrears more than doubled in the final three months of 2023 compared to the same period the year before.
The 124% rise was likely to be the result of high mortgage rates.
However, it still only accounts for a fraction of mortgages that are still being paid off.
UK Finance said there were 13,570 buy-to-let mortgages in arrears in the final quarter of last year. There are nearly two million mortgages being repaid by landlords in total.
These arrears - which are mostly of relatively low value - rose by 18% compared with the previous three months. But compared to the year before, the increase was more pronounced.
Graham Cox, a broker at the Self Employed Mortgage Hub, told Newspage: ""The surge in interest rates has led to either unaffordable refinancing costs or more void periods due to higher rents.
""The situation is particularly bad in London for landlords and tenants alike.""
Moves to repossess homes from landlords was at the highest level since the pandemic, UK Finance said.
Meera Chindooroy, from the National Residential Landlords Association, said more than eight in 10 of buy-to-let mortgages were on interest-only repayment terms, leaving them harder hit by rising mortgage rates.
""Faced with such challenges, many landlords are simply opting to leave the market altogether, exacerbating an already serious shortage of homes to rent,"" she said.
What is happening with your mortgage?
The trade body also released figures on the number of homeowners who had fallen behind on their mortgages.
A total of 93,680 were in arrears, which was up 7% on the previous quarter and 25% up on the same period a year earlier.
When arrears become so serious with no likelihood of payments being made, then a lender may seek to repossess a home. These remain rare, but are rising, and lenders and charities urge people to act early when facing trouble.
Talking to a mortgage lender about payment difficulties has no impact on a borrower's credit score and their ability to borrow in the future, although missing payments or getting a mortgage holiday would have an impact.

2024-02-05T12:33:01.000Z,CBI settles legal action brought by sacked boss Tony Danker,BBC News,"The CBI business group has settled legal action brought by its former boss Tony Danker for wrongful dismissal.
Mr Danker was sacked with immediate effect in 2023 following complaints about his behaviour.
His exit came as other separate allegations of historical misconduct at the lobby group were uncovered but were unconnected to Mr Danker.
The CBI confirmed it had agreed an ""undisclosed settlement"" with its former director-general.
The organisation, which claims to represent the interests of 170,000 businesses across the UK, also reiterated on Monday that Mr Danker was not associated with historical claims.
The CBI, one of the UK's most prominent lobby groups, was plunged into crisis last year following allegations of rape and sexual assault. It led to dozens of its direct members - including John Lewis, BMW and Virgin Media O2 - as well as thousands more via trade associations, quitting the group,
Events were postponed and the government halted engagement over economic and business policy discussions with the group, prompting fears over its funding and survival.
Before these misconduct allegations emerged, Mr Danker faced separate claims about his behaviour and stepped aside while an investigation began in March last year.
He was criticised for taking female colleagues to a karaoke bar, inviting young female colleagues to one-to-one breakfast meetings, as well as following and commenting on social media posts and sending personal messages on work platforms. He was sacked in April 2023.
Mr Danker acknowledged in a BBC interview after his dismissal that he had made some staff feel ""very uncomfortable"", adding: ""I apologise for that.""
But he claimed he had been made ""the fall guy"" for the wider crisis engulfing the CBI and that his reputation had been ""totally destroyed"".
Brian McBride, the then-CBI president, told the BBC after Mr Danker's departure that he was ""welcome to take his case to an employment tribunal or the courts if thinks he has been mistreated"".
He also said that Mr Danker's description of events was ""selective"".
It is understood Mr Danker eventually took his case to Bruce Carr KC, author of the Carr Review on industrial disputes.
On Monday, the CBI said it had settled the case, adding that its board ""also reiterates that Mr Danker is not associated in any way with the historical allegations reported in the media concerning matters which pre-date his tenure at the CBI and rejects any such association"".
If an employee has an issue with their dismissal, there are two types of legal action they can take. One is via an employment tribunal to assess whether the reasons why a person was dismissed were fair or unfair, or through a High Court action to assess whether how a person was dismissed was contractually appropriate.
Mr Danker's case appears to be the latter and while the settlement seems to be a vindication of sorts for him, it does not amount to an admission from the CBI that the grounds for his dismissal were unfair.
Rosemary Connolly, an employment lawyer, told the BBC wrongful dismissal claims arise where an employer has breached an ""aspect of the employee's contract at the time of dismissal"".
""Generally speaking this could relate to non-payment of notice or not permitting the employee to participate in a contractual disciplinary process,"" she said.
Born in Belfast, Mr Danker took charge of the CBI in November 2020.
Dame Carolyn Fairbairn was the previous director-general between 2015 and 2020 - the period when alleged sexual misconduct, including a rape at a CBI summer party in 2019, occurred.
He had previously spent 10 years as a consultant with McKinsey, and worked as a special adviser to the Treasury under Gordon Brown's government. He has also been international director, then chief strategy officer at Guardian News and Media.
The CBI is still trying to recover from the biggest scandal since it was founded in 1965 and has dismissed around a third of its staff as a result of a drop in membership fees.
Following an independent investigation by law firm Fox Williams, the CBI admitted it hired ""culturally toxic"" staff and failed to fire people who sexually harassed female colleagues.
It said a failure to act allowed a ""very small minority"" of staff to believe they could get away with harassment or violence against women.
It recently managed to raise additional funding and it has appointed business veteran Rupert Soames to be its new president.
Rain Newton-Smith, who replaced Tony Danker as the director-general, previously told the BBC she raised concerns over sexual harassment when she was in a senior role at the group.

2024-02-29T03:55:21.000Z,Winklevoss crypto firm Gemini to return $1.1bn to customers,BBC News,"Cryptocurrency exchange Gemini has agreed to return at least $1.1bn (£870m) to customers of its defunct lending programme as part of a settlement with the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS).
The company will also pay a $37m fine for ""significant failures"".
Gemini's Earn programme was halted during a crypto crash in November 2022.
The exchange was co-founded by twins Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss - known for their legal dispute with Facebook.
""Gemini failed to conduct due diligence on an unregulated third party, later accused of massive fraud, harming Earn customers who were suddenly unable to access their assets after Genesis Global Capital experienced a financial meltdown,""  NYDFS Superintendent Adrienne Harris said in a statement.
""Today's settlement is a win for Earn customers, who have a right to the assets they entrusted to Gemini.""
The NYDFS also said it could bring further action against Gemini if it did not return at least $1.1bn to customers.
In a blog post Gemini said it had ""worked tirelessly over the past 15 months to advocate for Earn users and seek the return of their assets"".
""If approved, we will be returning over $1.8 billion in value (at today's prices) — $700 million more than when Genesis halted withdrawals on November 16, 2022.""
The company also said it would contribute $40m to the conclusion of Genesis' bankruptcy in order to benefit Earn customers.
The Earn programme was offered in partnership with cryptocurrency lender Genesis Global Capital.
It was halted in November 2022, followed by Genesis filing for bankruptcy. Since then there has been extensive litigation between Genesis, Gemini and Genesis' parent company, Digital Currency Group.
Gemini Earn customers have been unable to access their funds in those accounts since late 2022. The settlement means they are one step closer to getting their money back.
Gemini is run by the Winklevoss twins, Tyler and Cameron, who are also known for a long-running legal dispute with Facebook and its boss Mark Zuckerberg.
In January 2023, Gemini and Genesis were charged by US regulators with illegally selling crypto assets to hundreds of thousands of investors.
The companies were accused of breaking the law by offering and selling the products through Earn, which launched in 2021.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission is in charge of the case.

2024-02-14T13:42:55.000Z,UK shop workers ‘targets’ as abuse and attacks soar,BBC News,"Shop workers feel like ""targets"" the BBC has heard, as reports of violence and abuse have soared.
Shop assistant John from Dundee said: ""It's almost a daily occurrence now where you are shouted at or sworn at"".
Violence and abuse against shop workers rose to 1,300 incidents a day last year, according to a trade body.
The British Retail Consortium (BRC) criticised the ""woefully inadequate"" action taken by the government to address the ""crisis"".
The government said it had already made it clear police must take a ""zero-tolerance"" approach to shoplifting.
New figures from the retail trade body found that incidents against staff were up by 50% in the year to September 2023, up from 870 incidents a day the year before.
The amount lost to shoplifting in the past year was the highest on record, its survey also found.
John, who has worked at an electrical store for 10 years, said that he sees shoplifting on a daily basis.
""Customers have been more aggressive and abusive since Covid.
""We are a target and thieves see it as a small business - they steal even big items so that they can sell them on.""
He said he was ""sure"" the police would attend if anything ""turns violent"" but said that his firm now factors in the daily losses.
Several business leaders have called for violence against shop workers to be made a standalone offence in England and Wales, as it already is in Scotland.
The BRC said incidents against retail staff ranged from racial abuse and sexual harassment to physical assault and threats with weapons.
It said about 8,800 of the total incidents across the year resulted in injury.
In one of the most extreme cases of violence in the services sector that the BBC heard, one customer assistant said that she was punched in the face and her jaw was broken in an apparently random attack by young customers.
The incident, which happened in the last week, has left her in fear of returning to work.
""I hid the fact I had an injury until they left, I couldn't risk them thinking I was injured because they might hit me again.
""I've had to have a plate in [my jaw]. It's really shaken me up, I'm scared to go back to work.""
She described abuse an an ""increasing problem"".
The BRC survey also found that theft by customers had doubled to 16.7 million incidents a year, up from eight million.
Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the BRC said that ""despite retailers investing huge sums in crime prevention, violence and abuse against retail workers is climbing.
""No one should have to go to work fearing for their safety. This is a crisis that demands action now.""
Not everyone agrees attacks on shop workers should be a treated as a standalone crime, however.
Transform Justice, a charity campaigning for a better justice system, said creating a new offence of assault shop worker would not help.
Director Penelope Gibbs said: short prison sentences ""drive increased reoffending"" because ""no rehabilitative work can be done with prisoners on short sentences.""
""The most effective response for low level assaults is for the police to apprehend whoever did it and deal with the crime out of court,"" she added.
Retailers lost £1.8bn in the latest year due to shoplifting, the BRC said, which is the highest amount on record.
Some retailers surveyed said the cost-of-living crisis had changed how shoplifters operated, from taking one or two items to many.
Incidents against staff tripled during the Covid-19 pandemic and have remained much higher since then.
The BRC said the government's Retail Crime Action Plan provided ""hope"" as it pledged a police commitment to prioritise crime scenes where there has been violence against a shop worker.
On Wednesday Home Office said violence against retail workers was unacceptable.
""The police have committed to patrol more areas and attend more shoplifting incidents, especially where violence has occurred.
""Good progress has been made on these commitments, however we will continue working closely with police and the sector to catch more perpetrators,"" it added.
In an open letter organised by the Institute of Customer Service in November, more than 50 businesses including John Lewis and the Post Office, as well as several MPs, urged the government to ensure assaults on shop workers were better recorded.
This would include recording such crimes separately in police statistics, they said.
In September, the boss of John Lewis said shoplifting had become an ""epidemic"" in the past year.

2024-03-08T00:08:42.000Z,Your personal data all over the web - is there a better way?,BBC News,"""From the beginning, I always meant for the web to be a platform for creativity and collaboration,"" says Sir Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the world wide web.
""The first decade of the web lived up to that promise, but that's not what we've seen in the last 20 years or so.""
Sir Tim says a particular problem is the way personal data is handled. When you log in and store data in a website, it can only be used within that website.
But an open source software project, called Solid, is designed to reverse that situation.
The idea of Solid is that people have a private data store, and they get to choose which organisations can access it, for what purpose, and for how long.
Called a Personal Online Data Store, or Pod, it gives users control over their data, and the freedom to combine it or share it between applications.
Sir Tim is co-founder of Inrupt, a company that provides Solid-based technologies. He says using the technology would mean that data storage would be ""centred around people, instead of around apps"".
Other companies providing Solid-based solutions include Graphmetrix and Digita.
In Flanders, Belgium, Athumi is working on several projects using Solid.
The company was set up by the Flemish government to help re-launch the economy after the Covid-19 emergency. The company acts as a neutral intermediary, connecting businesses in different sectors and enabling them to access sensitive company and citizen data.
Athumi's first Solid project launched last year in collaboration with recruitment company Randstad, prior to a rollout with other recruitment firms. During 2024, Athumi plans to scale this application to 30,000 users.
The application solves a common problem for job applicants in Belgium. They often have to submit copies of their diplomas, typically as photocopies by mail. Sometimes people struggle to find their certificates and getting replacements causes delay and costs money. ""We made the process very easy,"" says Björn De Vidts, chief executive of Athumi.
""The first step is to activate your pod. That is legally required because we cannot deliver services for a person who hasn't given us the authority to activate their pod. The second step is that you give permission to load your diploma into the pod. The third step is giving access to Randstad for a certain period of time to use the diploma in your pod for the specific job application."" Citizens access and manage their pods through a web browser.
For some roles, the recruiter needs to verify that the claimed qualification is genuine.
This can be time-consuming when dealing with paperwork. In the Solid application, the diploma has a token that guarantees the data is authentic and hasn't been changed.
More technology of business
The tech is also being piloted in healthcare.
Starting this year, five Belgian hospitals will store information about hospital visits in patients' Solid pods. The idea is that it will make it easier for patients to share their medical data. For example, they could share proof of a recent medical examination when applying for a job, so they don't need to have another one.
Athumi is also working with several media companies to create shared user profiles that span streaming services, so viewers can get better personalised services.
The pods store data in standard formats, so that it can be reused in multiple contexts. ""What I call the real fun stuff of the data economy is when we will be able to combine these different data elements,"" says Mr De Vidts. ""That will generate use cases that we cannot even predict today. When you have enough interesting data points, application builders will, we believe, come to the pod to build new applications.""
Research commissioned by the Flemish government indicates that citizens would be willing to use the pods if they save time or money, or they help them to improve their health.
The Flemish pods are hosted using Enterprise Solid Server, provided by Inrupt. John Bruce, Inrupt's co-founder and CEO, says you could have multiple pods hosted for you by companies such as internet service providers or travel firms you use frequently. All the pods can be accessed through one login.
Pods could potentially make life harder for hackers.
Even though pods may share a server, each one has its own access controls, set by the user. By contrast, a company database has one set of access controls that grants access to all customer records. ""Today you exist in big databases,"" says Mr Bruce. ""Your credit card is in there with 10 million others.
""That database is a high value target. [Hackers] will put months of work in to get that database. When the data value exists only in your pod, it is like the difference in the kind of attack one would get on a bank versus you getting mugged on the street. You're not going to get a team of people following you around for three months to nick your wallet,"" he says.
Amanda Finch, CEO of The Chartered Institute of Information Security, says Athumi's plan to create a centralised data platform will have benefits.
As well as easing the flow of data through the economy it could boost security.
""From a security standpoint, it should help to create a safer environment. With fewer platforms to secure, and responsibility lying with one, overarching party, you'd expect fewer vulnerabilities compared to multiple different solutions.""
She adds a note of caution, though, as the new architecture means citizens take responsibility for more sensitive data than they might previously have held. ""Putting security into the hands of users and citizens is a risk when you consider how many breaches have a human element,"" she says.
""If someone is duped into sharing their pod with a fraudster, then that's it - they've potentially lost everything. Users need to make their own conscious decisions on whether they share data. But this can only happen if citizens are educated on how they can reduce risk by instilling security best practices such as strong passwords or multi-factor authentication.""
Would all those companies used to hoarding data give it up easily? ""Companies don't want it,"" says Mr Bruce. ""If they could live in a world where they don't have to be responsible for your data, but they can have access to it, they'd take that in a heartbeat.""
Back at Athumi, Mr De Vidts thinks Solid could be the start of a data revolution.
""I've been working 25 years in B2B data collaboration, and this is the first time I've seen a data sharing technology that has this kind of potential to disrupt existing business models,"" he says. ""A citizen can decide what data goes to which consuming application. The data subject becomes the data controller.""

2024-02-07T11:10:55.000Z,"House price rises highest for a year in January, Halifax says",BBC News,"House price rises in January were the highest for a year as mortgage rates continued to ease, the Halifax has said.
A slowdown in inflation and a buoyant jobs market also helped push property prices up, it added.
The UK's biggest mortgage lender said a typical home now costs £291,029 on average, a 2.5% jump from January 2023.
The figures come as major housebuilder Barratt announced it would buy rival Redrow in a deal worth £2.5bn.
Housebuilders have struggled over the past couple of years as higher interest rates dented demand and construction costs rose.
But expectations of rates being cut this year, with inflation - the pace of price rises - slowing down, has led to ""increased confidence"" in the housing market, Halifax said.
However, it warned that while house prices had risen, interest rates still remained high compared with the historic lows seen in recent years, making it more expensive for prospective buyers to borrow.
The lender said first-time buyers faced average deposits of £53,414.
""It's not surprising that almost two thirds of new buyers getting a foot on the ladder are now buying in joint names,"" said Kim Kinnaird, director of Halifax Mortgages.
Ms Kinnaird said ""affordability challenges are likely to remain"" in the coming months and said further falls in house prices ""should not be ruled out, against a backdrop of broader uncertainty in the economic environment"".
Halifax's house price data is based on its own mortgage lending, which does not include buyers who purchase homes with cash, or buy-to-let deals. Cash buyers account for about a third of housing sales.
First-time buyers and homeowners looking to remortgage properties have faced higher borrowing costs in recent times. The Bank of England has held interest rates at a 16-year high of 5.25% since August 2023, in a bid to try to slow down the rapid pace of general price rises.
Alice Haine, personal finance analyst at Bestinvest, said with inflation expected to slow down in the coming months, the Bank could cut interest rate as soon as the summer.
""The improving outlook has resulted in better mortgage rates and affordability levels for first-time buyers and those looking to refinance,"" she said.
A typical two-year fixed mortgage rate would charge 5.57% interest on Tuesday, while a five year deal would charge 5.22%, according to data from Moneyfacts.
This is down from a peak of 6.86% for a two-year deal in July last year, it said.
David Thomas, chief executive of Barratt said despite the ""challenging"" economic environment, demand for the company's homes was ""strong"".
His comments came after Britain's biggest homebuilder Barratt announced it would buy Redrow, which is headquartered in Flintshire, Wales,  in an all stock deal.
The new combination, to be renamed ""Barratt Redrow"", will aim to build more than 22,000 homes each year in the medium term.
""Since the start of January, we have seen early signs of improvement in both reservation rates and buyer sentiment, helped by expectations of lower interest rates and the introduction of more competitive mortgage rates,"" Mr Thomas added.
Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the decision behind the merger was due to both companies believing they would be ""stronger together"", adding that they would have ""much bigger clout"" to take advantage on the need for more housing in the UK.

The technology giant reported that revenues surged by 265% to $22bn (£17.4bn) in the three months to 28 January, compared to a year earlier.
For the year as a whole, turnover more than doubled to $60.9bn.
""Accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point,"" said Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang.
""Demand is surging worldwide across companies, industries and nations.""
Nvidia also forecast a 233% jump in its quarterly revenues for the current quarter, beating analysts' estimates.
""There was a lot riding on this last quarter and they actually absolutely knocked it out of the park,"" Bob O'Donnell of Technalysis Research told the BBC.
""We're starting to see mainstream usage of AI,"" he added, highlighting that AI is not longer only used by specialised technology companies.
In addition to its AI chips, sales at the firm's data centres have grown rapidly.
Its data centre business contributed the vast majority of its revenues in the most recent quarter after growing more than than five-fold over the last year.
Nvidia said gross profit for the final three months of its financial year rose by 338% to $16.8bn. Annual gross profit rose by 188% to $44.3bn.
However, the company said it faced several challenges including constraints on its supply chains.
The US has also tightened its restrictions on trade with China, the world's second largest economy.
Ipek Ozkardeskaya, a senior analyst at Swissquote, told the BBC that Nvidia's results had been ""unusually amazing"".
But she added that Nvidia could face difficulties in addition to restrictions in China.
""Nvidia... will see challenges on the way up because first the revenue growth will likely stabilise and the euphoria regarding these growth and growth perceptions will level out,"" she said.
The company is also likely to face competition and regulation issues, Ms Ozkardeskaya added, and it could be ""constrained by their own capacity to respond to this fast-surging demand"".
AI's public profile has risen sharply since the launch in 2022 of ChatGPT, which was developed by Microsoft-backed OpenAI.
ChatGPT and other similar systems use huge amounts of data to create convincing human-like responses to user queries.
They are expected to dramatically change the way people search for information online.
Nvidia's stock market value has soared by 225% over the last year, making it one of the most valuable companies in the US. Its share price jumped by more than 9% in extended New York trading.

2024-02-27T13:10:00.000Z,Hunt considers National Insurance cuts at Budget,BBC News,"The chancellor is considering a cut in National Insurance, rather than income tax in the Budget, the BBC understands.
Jeremy Hunt is expected to make final decisions on his 6 March Budget plans at the end of this week.
A leading think tank has warned the government should not cut taxes in the upcoming Budget, unless it can spell out how it will afford them.
The government said it would not comment on whether further cuts to tax would be ""affordable in the Budget"".
At last year's Autumn Statement, Mr Hunt announced a bigger-than-expected cut in National Insurance, taking the main rate down from 12% to 10% from the start of this year.
The government's independent financial watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), said at the time this cut would help create 28,000 more jobs.
A further cut to National Insurance of 1% would cost £4.5bn per year.
As first reported in the Times, Mr Hunt is understood to be aiming for a similar approach this time, making what he calls ""smart tax cuts"" aimed at improving the economy.
Both Mr Hunt and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak have made no secret of wanting to reduce the taxation burden on the general public. Last month, the chancellor hinted that he was looking at trimming public spending as a way to deliver tax cuts.
However, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said on Tuesday that the case for tax cuts was ""weak"", and the chancellor should not go ahead with them without providing specific details of where the axe would fall.
Any tax cuts ""should wait"" until the chancellor was able to do a detailed spending review, the think tank said.
""We don't think we should be implementing certain tax cuts now, essentially that are paid for by uncertain spending cuts that might never be delivered,"" IFS deputy director Carl Emmerson said.
The IFS said taxes in the UK were heading to record-high levels when measured against the size of the overall economy. However, government debt was also high and rising, and ""barely on course"" to be falling in five years' time - one of the government's self-imposed rules.
Moreover, even this ""unhappy outlook"" for the public finances was based on spending cuts and tax rises, including a rise in fuel duties and changes to business rates that were ""unlikely to be realised"" the IFS said.
""There is therefore only a weak economic case for another sizeable net tax cut in the forthcoming Budget,"" the IFS wrote in its report published on Tuesday.
The IFS said if Mr Hunt did want to go ahead with tax cuts, he should look at reforming stamp duty on purchasing properties or shares, rather than reducing income tax or a further cut to National Insurance rates, which were reduced in January.
Mr Emmerson conceded that tax cuts can help to boost growth in the economy, but said: ""That doesn't mean the tax cuts will pay for themselves.
""There's lots of problems in our tax system - we need genuine tax reform - and if we want growth-friendly tax cuts we should be looking at stamp duty on purchases of properties and stamp duty on purchases of shares,"" he told the BBC's Today programme.
""They're very damaging taxes and cutting them would be better for growth than, for example, cutting the main rate of national insurance.""
The government is also considering announcing a new tax on vapes at the Budget next week.
Currently, vaping products are subject to VAT - but unlike tobacco, they are not also subject to a dedicated levy.
Tobacco duty could also be increased to make sure vaping remains cheaper.
The budgets for the NHS, schools, defence and overseas aid are ringfenced, however the IFS said unprotected areas such as justice and local government would see bigger squeezes as a result.
Local councils are already struggling with their own debts after years of shrinking budgets. Several have effectively gone bust, including Birmingham City Council, Nottingham, Thurrock and Woking.
The IFS said its calculations suggested that in order to keep real-terms spending per person at current levels for those unprotected services alongside ""plausible"" settlements for the NHS, childcare and other commitments, the chancellor would need to find a further £25bn.
The suggestion of tax cuts has drawn criticism from other quarters. Last month the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) described the government's ""pencilled-in"" post-election spending plans as a ""work of fiction"".
Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also advised the UK against further tax cuts, in its latest assessment of the world economy.
But there is extra political pressure on the decisions the chancellor will make next month. This Budget could be his last chance to announce big policy changes before a general election which must be held by January next year.
The government is set to borrow £113bn this year, £11bn less than was forecast in November, the IFS calculated, but still twice what it was borrowing prior to the pandemic.
The IFS warned that any extra ""headroom"" in the Budget, was in part the result of a falling bill for interest payments on government debt, an element which remained ""very volatile"".
In response to the IFS report the Treasury said it was normal for governments to outline broad spending plans and more detailed departmental budgets would be set in the usual way at the next Spending Review.
A Treasury spokesperson said: ""We are on track to meet our fiscal rules, and total departmental spending will be £85bn higher after inflation by 2028-29 than at the start of this Parliament, including record funding for the NHS.""
""Our responsible action with the public finances meant we could cut taxes for working people and businesses in the Autumn Statement,"" they said.

2024-02-09T13:16:23.000Z,Judge approves compensation for Neil Woodford investors,BBC News,"A High Court judge has approved a £230m redress scheme for investors trapped by the collapse of a fund run by the big-name stock picker Neil Woodford.
About 300,000 people lost money when the Woodford Equity Income Fund was frozen in 2019.
Almost 94% of investors backed the compensation scheme in a vote in December, although only 54,000 voted.
But campaigners say the court's decision is an ""appalling outcome"" and are considering an appeal.
Mr Woodford was one of the UK's most high-profile investment managers and when he set up his own managed fund, he came with an impressive reputation. He was as close to a household name as is possible in the world of investing.
Investors, ranging from ordinary people to pension funds, put money into the Woodford Equity Income Fund. At its peak, the fund reportedly managed more than £10bn.
But as they became increasingly worried about the investments being made on their behalf, many withdrew their money. More than £500m was taken out in four weeks and in June 2019 the fund was frozen. It was later closed and wound up.
The redress scheme was proposed by Link Fund Solutions (LFS), the former authorised corporate director of the fund. It comes after a Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) investigation and three investor groups filed lawsuits over the way LFS had managed the fund.
High Court Judge Jonathan Richards said in a ruling published on Friday that he saw no reason to contradict the conclusion of the ""overwhelming majority"" of investors.
If the scheme is implemented, it would hand an initial £183.5m payout this quarter.
The FCA, which backed the scheme, said investors could receive around 77p in every pound they had put in.
But campaigners say those calculations take in too narrow a view of losses.
The Transparency Task Force, which campaigns for some Woodford investors, said it offered an ""appalling outcome"" for those affected, with many ""unintentional consequences"" off the back of it.
Its founder, Andy Agathangelou, said: ""Most [investors] will get back between four and eight pence in the pound of their outstanding capital losses, with nothing for the returns forfeit over the past four and a half years, let alone consequential losses.""
It is considering an appeal against the court's approval, arguing that it removes legal protections for individuals.
Ryan Hughes from the investment platform AJ Bell said investors would be ""breathing a sigh of relief"".
""While there may be an appeal which means we aren't quite there yet, the fact that the judge has approved the scheme is a key milestone.
""With each new step taken investors will just hope this whole saga can be brought to a conclusion,"" he said.

2024-02-29T15:21:53.000Z,Body Shop to shut 75 stores and cut hundreds of jobs,BBC News,"The Body Shop will close 75 shops in the UK over the coming weeks and cut 489 jobs, according to the firm overseeing its restructuring.
It means that, combined with cost-cutting at the company's head office, between 750 and 800 people will be made redundant.
However, The Body Shop will keep 116 UK stores open.
The UK arm of the global beauty chain was put into administration earlier this month.
Shops will be closed over the next four to six weeks. FRP Advisory, which is managing the restructuring, said it would ""support all impacted staff with claims to the Redundancy Payments Service"".
""In taking swift action to right-size The Body Shop UK store portfolio, we have stabilised the business,"" said FRP Advisory's Tony Wright.
""We remain fully focused on exploring all options to take the business forward.""
Administrators are in the process of trying to salvage what they can from the business, having announced last week that up to half of The Body Shop stores would close.
The Body Shop was founded in Brighton in 1976 by the late Dame Anita Roddick who opened a single shop in the seaside town. Known for its natural beauty products and its stance against testing on animals, it expanded rapidly in the following years.
Dame Anita and her husband Gordon sold the business to French beauty giant L'Oreal in 2006, much to the chagrin of some loyal followers who viewed the French beauty giant's business at odds with The Body Shop's ethos.
Since then, The Body Shop has changed hands twice, most recently to private equity firm Aurelius in late 2023. Within weeks, it decided to place the UK arm in administration following poor sales over Christmas and January.
Wildly popular in the 1980s and 1990s, The Body Shop appeared to fall out of fashion as competitors arrived in the natural beauty market including Lush and Rituals.

The changes to the company's policy will come into effect at the end of next month.
The online rental platform says the move aims to simplify its rules on security cameras and prioritise the privacy of guests.
Airbnb users have previously voiced concerns about the use of indoor surveillance cameras.
""These changes were made in consultation with our guests, hosts and privacy experts, and we'll continue to seek feedback to help ensure our policies work for our global community,"" Airbnb's Head of Community Policy and Partnerships, Juniper Downs said in a statement.
""As the majority of listings on Airbnb do not report having a security camera, this update is expected to impact a smaller subset of listings on the platform,"" she added.
Airbnb's current rules allow the use of security cameras in common areas such as living rooms and hallways, as long as the location of the equipment is made clear on the property's listing.
The updated policy also bans the use of outdoor cameras that point inside properties. Airbnb does not allow surveillance cameras to be placed in private areas like bedrooms and bathrooms.
The new rules will still allow the use of doorbell cameras and noise monitors in common areas. These devices also have to be disclosed on the property's listing page.
Airbnb said it seeks to balance the need for hosts to be able to monitor the security of their property and be aware of issues such as unauthorised parties while prioritising the privacy of guests.
The announcement comes just over a week after US comedy show Saturday Night Live aired a spoof Airbnb advert which included a joke about a camera being hidden in a toilet. The sketch has been watched more than 1.2 million times on YouTube.

2024-02-06T15:31:33.000Z,BP reports second highest profit in a decade,BBC News,"Energy giant BP has reported its second highest annual profit in a decade, despite it being half the level it announced in the previous year.
Profits were $13.8bn (£11bn) in 2023, down from the record $27.7bn in 2022 when oil prices soared in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The price of oil fell back last year, which has cut profits at all energy firms.
However, BP said it was stepping up its plans to return cash to shareholders.
The results are the first released by BP since the company announced Murray Auchincloss as its new chief executive.
Previous boss Bernard Looney resigned last September after admitting he had not been ""fully transparent"" about his past personal relationships at the firm. BP's board said Mr Looney had committed ""serious misconduct"", resulting in him forfeiting up to £32.4m in pay and benefits.
The fall in BP's annual profits echo the results from rival Shell, who last week said profits fell to $28.2bn last year, down from $39.9bn in 2022.
However, excluding 2022's results, BP's annual profit figure was the biggest since 2012.
In the final three months of 2023, BP reported profits of $3bn, which was higher than expected, and its shares were up more than 5% by Tuesday afternoon.
The company also said it planned to increase returns to investors during the first three months of the year through $1.75bn of share buybacks. It has also committed to $3.5bn of buybacks over the first half of 2024.
BP said it expected ""underlying production from oil production and operations to be higher"" this year, but output from gas and low carbon energy to be lower.
The company came under fire last year from environmental groups after it scaled back plans to reduce the amount of oil and gas it produces by 2030.
Reacting to the latest results, campaign group Global Witness criticised BP's policies.
""Shareholders should want to protect their long-term positions. That means demanding a rapid clean energy transition for companies like BP. These reckless shareholder payouts do the opposite,"" said Jonathan Noronha-Gant from the group.
However, last week, the Financial Times reported that one investor group - BlueBell Capital Partners - had called on BP to scrap its targets for lower oil and gas output altogether, calling them ""irrational"".
But speaking to analysts on Tuesday, Mr Auchincloss said: ""We just disagree with them if I'm honest.
""We are very happy with the direction of travel, and the shareholders at the top tier are happy as well.""
Susannah Streeter from Hargreaves Lansdown said the priorities of BP's new boss had been made clear.
""Although on appointment he pledged that BP's strategy to transition from an international oil company to an integrated energy company was unchanged, the big share buy-back announcement shows the immediate focus is on boosting the share price and returning value to shareholders.""
Nick Butler, a former head of strategy at BP, told the BBC's Today programme there had been talk that the company could be a takeover target.
""The real defence against takeovers is performance and if that's going to be the new chief executive's focus I think we can be a bit more optimistic about the company,"" he said.
Energy prices started to climb when Covid lockdowns ended, but jumped in March 2022 when Russia invaded Ukraine. There were fears about disruption to energy supplies and many countries imposed sanctions preventing the import of all Russian oil and oil products.
The price of benchmark Brent crude oil reached nearly $128 a barrel soon after the invasion, but now stands just below $80.
The 2022 surge in prices led all energy companies to make bumper profits. In response, the UK government introduced a windfall tax, called the Energy Profits Levy (EPL), on the ""extraordinary"" earnings of firms on their UK operations to help fund a scheme to subsidise gas and electricity bills.
This subsidy scheme ended in June last year, but while household energy bills have fallen since 2022 they still remain far higher than they had been before the war in Ukraine began.
BP said that its North Sea business paid $1.5bn (£1.2bn) UK tax in 2023, of which $720m was due to the EPL. The year before, it paid $2.2bn in tax for its North Sea operations, including $700m from the EPL.
There had been fears that oil prices might surge as a result of attacks on shipping in the Red Sea by Houthi rebels, but so far they have been little changed.
The attacks led many companies, including BP, to divert ships away from the route through the Suez Canal. It is the quickest sea route between Asia and Europe and is particularly important in the transportation of oil and liquefied natural gas.

2024-03-11T04:35:53.000Z,Japan avoids technical recession as economic growth figures revised,BBC News,"Japan has avoided falling into a technical recession after its official economic growth figures were revised.
The revised data shows gross domestic product (GDP) was 0.4% higher in the last three months of 2023 compared to a year earlier.
Provisional figures released last month indicated the second consecutive quarter of economic contraction.
Two quarters in a row of an economy shrinking is typically considered the definition of a technical recession.
But the revised figures still came below expectations, as some economists had forecast an upward revision to fourth quarter GDP of around 1%.
Hopes that the country had skirted a recession were boosted last week when figures from the Ministry of Finance showed a sharp rise in the amount companies invested in their businesses.
However, the figures from Japan's Cabinet Office on Monday showed private consumption, which makes up about 60% of the economy, fell by 0.3% for the period.
Japan's uneven economic performance may see another contraction in the current quarter due to the impact of issues including a slowdown of neighbouring China's economy and a suspension of production at car maker Daihatsu.
The upward revision to the fourth quarter GDP came as expectations are growing that the country's central bank could soon raise interest rates.
The Bank of Japan has held rates at -0.1% since it cut borrowing costs below zero in 2016 as it tried to boost spending and investment.
Negative rates make the yen less attractive to global investors, which has pushed down the currency's value.
Japan's main stock market index, the Nikkei 225, was around 2.5% lower on Monday morning.

The price per unit will now be displayed alongside the total price.
The move comes after Which? said the UK's biggest supermarket could have been breaking the law over how it displayed Clubcard prices, making it tough for shoppers to compare deals.
The supermarket challenged the claims, but has now said it will make changes.
""This is something that we have been planning to do for some time,"" said Tesco's UK chief executive Jason Tarry, who said there were 8,000 Clubcard offers every week.
""Over the coming weeks these changes will appear in all our stores, as our colleagues update millions of price labels on the shelf edge. We will also be adding these unit prices to our Clubcard Prices deals online,"" he wrote in a blog.
Rocio Concha, Which? director of policy and advocacy, said that prices needed to be clear when some consumers were struggling to afford meals.
""The lack of unit pricing on Tesco's Clubcard offers was a glaring omission and we warned that this approach could be breaking the law last summer, so it's good to see the nation's largest supermarket stepping up to do the right thing by making this important change,"" she said.
""We look forward to seeing this rolled out quickly across all stores and online so shoppers can benefit as soon as possible.""
The Tesco Clubcard is a loyalty scheme that offers members discounted prices on products.
As reported by the BBC in June last year, Which? reported the supermarket to the regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), pointing to prices of ketchup as an example of unclear pricing.
Which? had said Tesco's decision not to display unit pricing on its Clubcard offers could be breaking the law.
According to competition rules, unit prices could be seen as ""material information"" which most people would need in order to make an informed decision about how to get the best value from what they are buying.
In its response at the time, Tesco said it complied with all current rules and called Which?'s claims ""ill-founded"".
Sarah Taylor, food and beverage regulation partner at Keystone Law, said that while Tesco's move to start unit pricing on its Clubcard deals was welcomed by campaigners, it might prove difficult for some products.
""Products with a very short shelf-life and 'meal deals' where the promotion applies when purchasing a combination of different products may present particular challenges,"" she said.
Food prices recorded their first monthly fall in more than two years in January, but the cost of a weekly shop still remains much higher than two years ago.
Falls in prices for food items such as crackers, cake and crisps helped offset the rise in electricity and gas costs to keep overall annual inflation - the rate at which prices rise - unchanged at 4%. Cooking sauce and instant coffee costs also eased.

2024-03-13T13:02:09.000Z,Post Office scandal explained: What the Horizon saga is all about,BBC News,"The government has introduced new legislation to overturn the convictions of sub-postmasters who were the victims of what has been called the biggest miscarriage of justice in UK history.
Hundreds were wrongly prosecuted after faulty computer software said money was missing from post office branch accounts.
The new law is designed to speed up the process of clearing their names and paying them compensation.
More than 900 sub-postmasters and postmistresses were prosecuted for stealing money because of incorrect information provided by a computer system called Horizon.
The Post Office itself brought many of the cases to court, and between 1999 and 2015, it prosecuted 700 people - an average of one person a week.
Another 283 cases were brought by other bodies, including the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).
Many of those convicted went to prison for false accounting and theft. Many were financially ruined.
In 2017, a group of 555 sub-postmasters took legal action against the Post Office. In 2019, it agreed to pay them £58m in compensation, but much of the money they received was swallowed up by legal fees.
Although campaigners won the right to have their cases reconsidered, as at 15 January 2024, only 95 convictions had been overturned.
The Metropolitan Police is also investigating the Post Office over potential fraud offences arising from the prosecutions.
A public inquiry began in February 2021, chaired by Sir Wyn Williams.
The Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) said the scandal was ""the most widespread miscarriage of justice the CCRC has ever seen, and represents the biggest single series of wrongful convictions in British legal history"".
The issue was highlighted by the ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office, which was broadcast in January 2024. The popularity of the series prompted a renewed sense of urgency for action.
Horizon was developed by the Japanese company Fujitsu, for tasks such as accounting and stocktaking. It was introduced by the Post Office in 1999.
Sub-postmasters quickly complained about bugs in the system after it falsely reported shortfalls - often for many thousands of pounds.
The Horizon system is still used by the Post Office, which describes the latest version as ""robust"".
Many former sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses say the scandal ruined their lives.
Some used their own money to cover non-existent shortfalls because their contracts with the Post Office stated they were responsible for any unexplained loss. Many faced bankruptcy or lost their livelihoods.
Marriages broke down, and some families believe the stress led to debilitating health conditions, addiction and even premature death.
Days after the ITV drama was broadcast in January, the government said it would ""swiftly exonerate and compensate"" those affected.
The relevant new legislation was introduced on Wednesday 13 March.
The law will apply to convictions in England and Wales, and is expected to clear the majority of victims by the end of July.
Convictions will be automatically quashed if they were:
The government said a new Horizon Convictions Redress Scheme will process compensation applications ""as soon as possible"" for those whose convictions are quashed.
Affected sub-postmasters will receive an interim payment, or can instead accept a fixed and final offer of £600,000.
The scheme will be run by the Department for Business and Trade.
Downing Street previously said it would work with Scotland and Northern Ireland to ensure the people who were wrongly accused in those nations would also be cleared.
Post Office Minister Kevin Hollinrake previously said the government has budgeted £1bn for compensation.
More than 4,000 people were told they are eligible, under three separate schemes:
Prof Chris Hodges, chair of the the independent Horizon Compensation Advisory Board, told the BBC that some individual compensation claims were ""well over £1m"".
The Post Office is owned by the government. However, the Post Office Ltd board is responsible for day-to-day operations.
Former Post Office chief executive Paula Vennell resigned in 2019 over the scandal. In January 2024, she said she would hand back her CBE after a petition calling for its removal gathered more than a million signatures.
In August 2023, current chief executive Nick Read said he would return all of the bonus money he had received for his work on the Horizon inquiry.
Fujitsu Europe director Paul Patterson told the Post Office inquiry that his firm had ""clearly let society down"". He previously told MPs that Fujitsu had a ""moral obligation"" to help fund compensation payments.
Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey has been criticised for refusing to meet Alan Bates, the sub-postmaster who led the campaign to expose the scandal, when he was postal affairs minister in May 2010. He says he was ""deeply misled by Post Office executives"".
The BBC discovered that former Prime Minister David Cameron's government knew the Post Office had dropped a secret investigation that might have helped postmasters prove their innocence.
Separately, Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch denied claims from former Post Office chair Henry Staunton that he was told to delay compensation payments to allow the government to ""limp into the election"".

2024-02-21T06:57:18.000Z,HSBC: Bank's pre-tax profits soar fuelled by high interest rates,BBC News,"Europe's biggest bank, HSBC, has posted an almost 80% jump in its pre-tax profit which rose to $30.3bn (£24bn) in 2023, fuelled by high interest rates.
It comes after central banks around the world raised interest rates in last 18 months to help curb rising prices.
Last week, rival lender NatWest revealed its highest yearly profit since the financial crisis in 2007.
But a slowdown in China's economy has meant that HSBC's profit was not as high as expected.
Its bottom line was also affected by a hefty $3bn charge from its stake in China's Bank of Communications.
The bank makes most of its profits in Asia, especially in China and Hong Kong.
HSBC's pre-tax profit for 2022 was $17.1bn and analysts were expecting it to jump to $34.1bn last year.
But its chief executive, Noel Quinn, said in a statement: ""Our record profit performance in 2023 enabled us to reward our shareholders with our highest full-year dividend since 2008.""
""They've had quite a sizable increase in what we call net interest margin which is the difference between the amount they charged borrowers and the amount they pay to depositors,"" banking analyst Frances Coppola told the BBC.
""That's really been the principal driver of the increase both in revenues and profits,"" she added.
""But we have to note that the high interest rate environment is coming to an end.""
The London-based lender rewarded investors with a new $2bn share buyback.
In addition to three share buybacks totalling $7bn, Mr Quinn said the bank returned $19bn to shareholders last year.
Investors have also been closely watching HSBC's exposure to China's property sector, which has been engulfed in crisis since 2020.
China, the world's second biggest economy is experiencing falling prices, known as deflation, which tends to discourage consumers from spending as they expect items to be cheaper in the future.
Last month, a court in Hong Kong ordered the liquidation of debt-laden property giant Evergrande.
""China's economy just can't kick into gear,"" Moody's economist Harry Murphy Cruise had earlier told the BBC. ""Investors are crying out for larger economic supports to be rolled out.""

Those on means-tested benefits including universal credit will be paid directly, without the need to make a claim, by 22 February.
However, the payments have not tackled the extent of the financial problems many people face, a group of MPs says.
It is available to households who receive these benefits:
The final instalment of £299 follows two others last year, of £301 and £300.
To qualify, people need to have claimed a benefits payment between 13 November 2023 and 12 December 2023. Those who received a payment for an assessment period ending between these dates are also eligible.
Pensioner households may be able to have a new pension credit claim backdated.
An estimated 850,000 pensioner households do not claim pension credit, which is a gateway to these extra payments.
People are not eligible if they receive new-style employment and support allowance, contributory employment and support allowance, or new-style jobseeker's allowance - unless they get universal credit.
Anyone who thinks they should have received the help but did not should contact the office that pays their benefit or tax credits, or report it here.
The payment reference on a recipient's bank account is their National Insurance number, followed by DWP COL.
The 1.1 million people who receive only working tax credit or child tax credit, rather than any of the other benefits have the reference HMRC COLS.
Cost of living payments do not affect the tax you pay, or the benefits or tax credits you receive.
Households that receive the winter fuel payment - which is paid to nearly all homes with at least one person of pension age - received an extra payment of between £150 and £300 during the winter.
Lower-income pensioners who claim pension credit get the money in addition to the support provided for those on benefits.
A £150 payment was also made to up to six million people receiving disability benefits, between 20 June and 4 July.
All cost of living payments go straight into recipients' bank accounts.
People are being warned about scammers trying to trick people into handing over personal information.
Payments were not enough for many people, MPs on the Commons Work and Pensions Committee said in a report published in November.
It said payments were not enough for those with extra costs associated with their disabilities. Disability charity Scope says some people cannot afford to power vital equipment.
There was particular concern for some larger families.
The report said the payments have had an important impact, but the system was relatively unsophisticated, meaning some of those in need slipped through the net.
It said that in future, the government should consider increasing benefits rather than giving ad-hoc payments.
However, the government said cost of living payments have provided ""a significant financial boost to millions of households"".

A rebranded image of a lion's head with a single bee will feature on products, including the firm's plastic syrup and dessert bottles.
But the classic Lyle's Golden Syrup tin will be excluded from the rebrand, keeping its more than 150-year-old packaging design.
The company said it was to refresh its appeal to modern shoppers.
The original logo, which includes the biblical quotation ""out of the strong came forth sweetness"", is the world's oldest unchanged brand packaging, holding a Guinness World Record, having remained nearly identical since 1888, the brand said.
Lyle's well-known Victorian-style tins were first introduced by Scottish businessman Abram Lyle more than 150 years ago, the same year as the first electric railway.
According to the company's website, Lyle had strong religious views, which is why the logo depicts the story of Samson from the Old Testament, in which Samson killed an attacking lion, and later noticed a swarm of bees had formed a comb of honey in the carcass.
He later turned this into a riddle: ""Out of the eater came forth meat and out of the strong came forth sweetness.""
The second half of the quote was used on the original branding of Lyle's Golden Syrup.
The rollout of the new packaging design - a golden illustration of a lion's head - will begin this month and continue throughout the year across its full-sized bottles, breakfast bottles, dessert toppings and golden syrup portions, Lyle's Golden Syrup said.
The company's brand director James Whiteley said the firm needed to show consumers it was moving with the times and meeting their current needs.
""Our fresh, contemporary design brings Lyle's into the modern day, appealing to the everyday British household while still feeling nostalgic and authentically Lyle's,"" he said.
Helen Edwards, adjunct associate professor of marketing at London Business School, said the rebrand would help to reduce the risk of excluding potential buyers.
""The story of it coming from religious belief could put the brand in an exclusionary space, especially if it was to go viral on X or TikTok,"" she told the BBC.
""But hanging on to some of the original branding is a good idea as people tend to remember brands through visual codes - the green colour, the lion - which remind people 'that's the product I buy, that's the one I like.'""
Lyle's Golden Syrup is owned by Tate & Lyle Sugars.

2024-03-05T04:07:13.000Z,National People's Congress: China sets ambitious 2024 economic target,BBC News,"China has set an ambitious growth target of around 5% for this year, as it outlined a series of measures aimed at boosting its flagging economy.
Premier Li Qiang made the announcement at the opening of the annual National People's Congress (NPC) on Tuesday.
Mr Li acknowledged that China's economic performance had faced ""difficulties"", adding that many of these had ""yet to be resolved"".
It comes as China struggles to reinvigorate its once-booming economy.
""Risks and potential dangers in real estate, local government debt, and small and medium financial institutions were acute in some areas,"" he said. ""Under these circumstances, we faced considerably more dilemmas in making policy decisions and doing our work.""
A series of other measures to help tackle the country's slow recovery from the pandemic were also announced, including the development of new initiatives to tackle problems in the country's crisis-hit property sector. Beijing also aims to add 12 million jobs in urban areas.
Regulation of financial markets will also be increased, said Premier Li, while research will be stepped up in new technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI) and life sciences.
Along with measures to boost the economy, defence spending will be increased by 7.2% this year.
Beijing's defence budget is closely watched by its neighbours and the US, due to concerns over its intentions as tensions remain high over Taiwan.
For decades the Chinese economy expanded at a stellar rate, with official figures putting its gross domestic product (GDP) growing at an average of close to 10% a year.
On the way it overtook Japan to become the world's second largest economy, with Beijing claiming that it had lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty.
Beijing says that last year the economy grew by 5.2%, which even at that level is low for China. However, some critics argue the real figure could be less than a third of that.
""I think the next five or 10 years is going to be difficult,"" Andrew Collier Managing Director from China research firm Orient Capital Research told the BBC.
""A lot of economists think the numbers are completely fabricated. The idea of 5.2% or 5.5% growth is much likely wrong. It's more like 1% or 2%,"" he added.
Whichever figures are accurate, it is clear that this vast country and its leaders face a daunting array of economic challenges.
That list includes a property market in crisis, a shaky stock market, high youth unemployment and the threat of deflation as consumer prices continue to fall.
Those immediate problems are compounded by longer term issues from trade and geopolitical tensions to China's falling birth rate and aging population.
One of the most serious of these challenges are associated with the housing market, which according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) accounts for around 20% of the economy.
It is a major problem ""not just for property developers but also the regional banks that are highly exposed to it,"" Dan Wang, chief economist of Hang Seng Bank (China), said.
The real estate industry crisis was highlighted last week when the country's biggest private developer Country Garden was hit with a winding-up petition in Hong Kong by a creditor.
It came just a month after debt-laden rival Evergrande was ordered to liquidate by a court in the city.
And while much of the rest of the world has struggled with soaring prices in the wake of the pandemic, China was one of the few major economies to avoid high inflation.
Now though it is having to deal with the opposite problem - persistently falling prices or deflation.
Consumer prices in China fell in January at the fastest pace in almost 15 years, marking the fourth month in a row of declines.
It was the sharpest drop since September 2009, when the world economy was still reeling from the effects of the global financial crisis.
Deflation is bad for economies as it can mean that people keep putting off buying big ticket items, like washing machines or cars, on the expectation that they will be cheaper in the future.
It also has an impact on people and businesses with debts. Prices and incomes may fall, but debts do not. For a company with falling revenue, or a household with a declining income, debt payments become more of a burden.
All of this means China is lacking something vital to a strong economy: confidence. And authorities have been scrambling to reassure investors and consumers.
""Messaging from policymakers continues to be about restoring confidence and domestic demand,"" Catherine Yeung from Fidelity International told the BBC.
So far that has meant a series of relatively small measures targeting different parts of the economy.
This year alone, borrowing costs have been cut and direct support offered to developers along with other actions to tackle the property crisis.
Earlier this month, in a shock move, the head of China's stock market regulator was replaced, in what was seen as a signal that the government was ready to take forceful measures to end the rout in its $8 trillion stock market.
Officials have also moved to clamp down on traders betting against shares in Chinese companies, and imposed new rules on selling shares at the start and end of the trading day.
Beyond these immediate issues China also faces a number of more far-reaching challenges, including slowing productivity growth and an aging population.
""The demographic dynamics are quite unfavourable, with the population aging fast due to the one-child policy,"" Qian Wang, chief Asia-Pacific economist at investment firm Vanguard said.
""Unlike Japan that got rich before it got old, China is getting old before it gets rich,"" she added.
There is also the seemingly intractable geopolitical issue of Taiwan.
Beijing sees self-ruled Taiwan as a breakaway province that will eventually be part of China, and has not ruled out the use of force to achieve this. But Taiwan sees itself as distinct from the Chinese mainland.
Taiwan is a key flashpoint in the tussle between China and the US for supremacy in Asia.
This, at the very least, greatly complicates China's relations with the US and many other major Western economies.
There is also the ongoing trade dispute with the US, which started in 2018 under then-president Donald Trump and has shown no sign of easing during the Biden administration.
A potential second term in office for Mr Trump could well see tensions ramp up between Washington and Beijing.
Mr Trump, in characteristically hawkish comments about China, said he would impose more tariffs on its goods if he wins the US presidential election in November.
In an interview with Fox News, he said the tariffs could be in excess of 60%: ""We have to do it,"" he said.
While that may make for plenty of headlines, Ms Yeung suggests financial markets may be able to take this in their stride.
""Most of this negative news has already been factored in to share valuations,"" she said.
Whether Mr Xi's long-term plans for China will turn around his country's fortunes remains to be seen.
What is clear though is that its more than 1.4 billion people are unlikely to enjoy a return to double digit annual growth, and the prosperity that comes with it, anytime soon.

2024-03-06T12:18:33.000Z,John Lewis and Co-op to increase minimum pay for staff,BBC News,"John Lewis and the Co-op are both raising minimum pay levels for workers as retailers try to retain staff and react to the rising living wage.
John Lewis and Waitrose - both part of the same group - will lift pay for store workers to £11.55 an hour from April, and to £12.89 in London.
This is above the compulsory National Living Wage, which will increase to £11.44 per hour next month.
The Co-op will increase pay for 37,000 store workers by 10.1% to £12 an hour.
In London, the rate will go up to £13.15 an hour.
The Co-op is owned by its members and runs Britain's seventh biggest grocery chain.
It said the move was its ""biggest ever investment into pay"", with an increase of more than 20% in the past two years for workers.
The John Lewis Partnership is also owned by its members and has 80,000 partners. It claims to be the largest employee-owned business in the UK.
The National Living Wage will include 21 and 22-year-olds for the first time when it increases in April. The minimum wage will also go up, and still apply to those of school leaving age and up.
Due to the rise, big supermarkets and retailers have been announcing pay deals over the past few weeks.
Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda, Aldi, Lidl and M&S have all said they will increase pay.
Aldi put in place higher pay at the start of February, and Lidl and Sainsbury's increased wages from March.
Workers at M&S will get a pay rise from April, while Asda will bring in an interim increase on 1 April to £11.44 an hour before raising the rate to £12.04 an hour from 1 July.

2024-02-06T17:21:29.000Z,Boeing safety checks to use 'more boots on ground',BBC News,"The head of the US aviation regulator has said ""more boots on the ground"" will be used to step up safety checks on Boeing planes.
Federal Aviation Administrator Mike Whitaker told US lawmakers on Tuesday that Boeing is being ""closely scrutinised"" after a door plug broke off one of its planes last month.
No-one was seriously hurt in the mid-air blowout.
But issues found in inspections since have raised questions about standards.
Mr Whitaker told a congressional committee he would ensure aircraft manufacturer Boeing would be held accountable for any future failure or refusal to comply with the FAA.
His comments came in the wake of last month's incident in which an unused door blew out of an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 Max nine minutes after take-off from Portland International Airport.
Although no-one was seriously hurt, the incident could have been much worse had it occurred later in the flight.
Since then, loose bolts and fixings on other planes, revealed in aircraft inspections, have called into question Boeing's manufacturing standards.
The airline manufacturer revealed this week that more defects had been found on parts of the fuselage - the main tube of the aircraft - which were sent to Boeing by its key supplier, Spirit AeroSystem.
The FAA itself has faced criticism for allegedly failing to impose sufficient oversight on Boeing.
Concerns were first raised in the aftermath of two catastrophic accidents affecting the 737 Max in late 2018 and early 2019, in which 346 people died.
At the time, the aviation regulator was accused of allowing itself to be unduly influenced by the company it was supposed to be overseeing - so-called ""regulatory capture"".
Last month's door blow-out has once again cast a spotlight on the work of the agency.
Appearing before the House of Representatives Transportation and Infrastructure subcommittee, Mr Whitaker said inspections of 737 Max aircraft had shown that ""the quality system issues at Boeing were unacceptable and require further scrutiny"".
He pointed out that Boeing had already been prevented from expanding production of the 737 Max, and said the FAA had launched an investigation scrutinising Boeing's compliance with manufacturing requirements.
Mr Whitaker added that the FAA was looking forward to the results of a comprehensive review of Boeing's safety culture being carried out by a panel including representatives of the FAA, labour unions, engineering experts and others.
The FAA would ""follow the data and take appropriate and necessary action"", he said.
""Let me stress, the safety of the flying public is our mission,"" he concluded.
Responding to questions from lawmakers, Mr Whitaker said the Alaska Airlines incident had created two issues for the regulator.
""The first is what's wrong with this plane? The second is what's going on with Boeing?"" he explained.
""They have had issues in the past, and they don't seem to be getting resolved.""
He said the FAA currently had about two dozen inspectors working in Boeing's factories, with another half a dozen at Spirit Aerosystems.
However, he said no decision had been taken about the future of the ODA (Organisation Designation Authorisation), a system which allows Boeing to carry out some safety certification work itself on behalf of the regulator.
In the past, this system has been described as Boeing ""marking its own homework"".

2024-03-01T14:55:57.000Z,"First class stamp price to rise again to £1.35, says Royal Mail",BBC News,"The price of stamps will rise again on 2 April - the fourth increase in two years for the cost of sending a letter first class.
Royal Mail said the price of a first-class stamp would rise by 10p to £1.35 and second-class stamps would increase by 10p to 85p.
It comes after warning by the loss-making firm over the impact of higher costs and lower demand for letters.
On Monday, the BBC revealed the impact of problems with deliveries.
The cost of sending a letter second class from the second of April - 85p - will be the same as it cost to send one first class at the start of 2022.
Nick Landon, chief commercial officer at Royal Mail, said: ""We always consider price changes very carefully, but we face a situation where letter volumes have reduced dramatically over recent years while costs have increased.
""It is no longer sustainable to maintain a network built for 20 billion letters when we are now only delivering seven billion.
""As a result of letter volume decline, our posties now have to walk more than three times as far to deliver the same number of letters as before, increasing the delivery costs per letter.""
The company said that adults typically spent less than £7 a year on stamped letters and people now received two letters a week on average. It said the cost of stamps remained below European averages.
Royal Mail, which made a loss of £419m last year, has long-argued prices had to rise due to the lack of reform of the one-price-goes-anywhere Universal Service Obligation (USO).
This requires the company to deliver letters to all 32 million UK addresses six days a week, Monday to Saturday.
But parcel deliveries have become more popular - and more profitable - for Royal Mail, which has been a private business for about a decade since it was split from the Post Office.
Change to the service now seems inevitable, with regulator Ofcom saying the postal service was ""getting out of date"" and action needed to be taken.
Under possible reforms, Royal Mail could reduce the number of days it delivers letters from six per week to five or even three, Ofcom said.
It estimated the company could save between £100m and £200m a year if delivery days were cut to five per week, and between £400m and £650m if there were just three postal days.
Another option would be to extend the number of days it takes for most letters to be delivered.
But ministers have said while they are happy for a debate reforms, the government is committed to keeping a six-day service.
Consumer groups criticised the latest price rises.
""Royal Mail is choosing to hike prices at a time when millions are left waiting for letters - vital medical appointments, legal documents and benefit decisions - all thanks to post delays. Nobody should be paying more for an unreliable service,"" said Morgan Wild of Citizens Advice.
""Ofcom should be holding Royal Mail to account, but it's letting the company get away with rocketing prices and nearly half a decade of missed delivery targets. Enough is enough, it's time for the regulator to act.""

Reporter Zoe Conway speaks to Royal Mail insiders about problems facing the company and hears from its management about how proposed changes may help stave off multi-million-pound losses.

2024-02-27T22:06:47.000Z,Post Office confirms boss is under investigation,BBC News,"The Post Office has confirmed that its current boss, Nick Read, is under investigation, after its former chairman Henry Staunton shocked MPs by making the revelation.
Mr Staunton was at a hearing to discuss compensation payments to sub-postmasters at the centre of the Horizon scandal.
Alan Bates, who inspired an ITV drama on the issue, told MPs the government should ""get on and pay people"".
The investigation is ongoing.
The Post Office confirmed there were complaints against Mr Read and other staff.
MPs were questioning a number of key figures about the pace of financial redress for thousands of sub-postmasters.
The MPs had been told by witnesses earlier in the day that an internal investigation was under way into Mr Staunton over his alleged behaviour while he chaired the company.
However, Mr Staunton alleged that there was actually an investigation into Mr Read.
He also claimed that within an 80-page document - a page of which he showed to MPs, with many lines redacted - it was said that Mr Read wanted to resign from the Post Office because he was unhappy with his pay.
The Post Office released a statement saying Nick Read ""has never tendered his resignation and he continues to accept leadership responsibility for the challenges that we are all working on each day"".
It added that there is ""a complaint"" against Mr Read and other employees, and that he ""has cooperated fully with the investigation"".
The Department for Business and Trade said that it was aware that Mr Read was also under investigation but it had ""not seen the 80-page report referred to by Henry Staunton and cannot attest to the content"".
Downing Street has also insisted it has confidence in the Post Office boss, with the prime minister's deputy spokesperson saying: ""We continue to work very closely with him.
""It's important at this point that everyone remains focused on ensuring we have the compensation and justice for the postmasters.""
Some 700 sub-postmasters were prosecuted by the Post Office for theft and false accounting between 1999 and 2015 after the Horizon IT system, developed by Fujitsu, made it look like there were shortfalls at branch accounts.
It led to what has been described as the most widespread miscarriage of justice in British legal history.
Thousands more pumped their own money into the Post Office shops they managed to cover discrepancies caused by Horizon.
Sub-postmasters are seeking compensation from the government, but Mr Bates said the government - which owns the Post Office - has failed to get a grip on the process of paying money to claimants.
""It's very disappointing,"" he said. ""This has been going on for years, as you well know, and I can't see any end to it.""
Mr Staunton, who was sacked as Post Office chair in January, said the compensation process had slowed right down until the Mr Bates vs The Post Office drama was aired in January and re-ignited interest in the long-running scandal.
The slow pace at which postmasters are receiving compensation risked being overshadowed by a recent row between Mr Staunton and Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch.
Mr Staunton gave an interview more than a week ago claiming that he had been told by a senior civil servant in January last year to slow down the spend on compensation.
Ms Badenoch hit back at the claims, saying they were ""completely false"". She also said she had sacked Mr Staunton following ""very serious allegations about his conduct while chair of the Post Office"". Concerns were also raised about the process of appointing a senior independent director at the Post Office, whose role includes challenging the chair on any issues. The appointment would replace Ben Tidswell, who is stepping down later this year.
Mr Staunton said on Tuesday that he was the victim of a ""smear campaign"", before he claimed that Mr Read was at the centre of an investigation, consisting of allegations made by the Post Office's former HR boss. Mr Staunton claims that Mr Read and the senior HR person ""fell out"".
The ex-chair also claimed that Mr Read had tried to resign four times during the time Mr Staunton was at the Post Office, between December 2022 and January 2024.
That contrasted with comments by Mr Read a short time earlier when, asked by MPs if he had ever tried to resign from the Post Office, he said under oath: ""No. Why do you ask?""
The Department for Business and Trade said that Ms Badenoch ""was clear in her statement to the House of Commons on 19 February that she lost confidence in Mr Staunton because he was blocking an investigation into his conduct, as well as his attempt to bypass the formal process to appoint a new director to the board"".
It added: ""The department will await the outcome of the investigation into Mr Read before making any further judgement.""
However, speaking on BBC Radio 4's PM programme on Tuesday, Charlotte Nichols, a Labour MP who sits on the Commons Business committee, hit out at Ms Badenoch after the hearing.
""I think [Tuesday's hearing] really raises a number of questions for Kemi Badenoch, particularly as she came in quite characteristically two-footed in her denials of [Mr Staunton's] assertions when they were first made.
""I think that there are questions still to be answered about why recollections vary as much as they do,"" she added.

2024-03-12T00:01:23.000Z,When wind turbine blades get old what's next?,BBC News,"The cranes moved in last year at Hagshaw Hill, Scotland's oldest commercial wind farm.
They were there to continue the dismantling of wind turbines that had been generating electricity for the last 28 years.
A similar scene can be witnessed across the world as the first wave of wind turbines built in the late 1990s and early 2000s are decommissioned.
In the case of Hagshaw Hill, the existing turbines will be replaced with taller and more efficient ones that can generate up to 10 times more electricity.
But working out what to do with the old turbines is challenging.
Between 85 and 95% of a turbine's materials, such as steel, aluminium, and copper, can be easily recycled, but the blades are a different matter.
Made of fibreglass they are covered with a tough epoxy resin, designed to withstand years of hammering by the elements.
These durable qualities make breaking down the blades for recycling a tricky process.
Traditional solutions include using pieces of decommissioned blades in cement kilns to manufacture cement, though this can be an energy intensive process.
Blades are also commonly disposed of in landfill sites, but this option is becoming increasingly less feasible with a number of countries, notably Germany and the Netherlands, banning the practice.
Innovative solutions such as repurposing blades into playgrounds or bike sheds have been shown to be effective at a local level but, with some experts predicting up to 43 million tonnes of wind turbine blade waste by 2050, there is a pressing need for a system that will work on a bigger scale.
Scientists and start-ups are working on the problem, with many focusing on tackling the challenge of breaking down the materials used in the blades.
""At the end of life, if we're going to get any value out of the materials, we need to be able to separate the fibres from the resin in some way or another,"" Dr Claire Barlow, a sustainability and materials engineer, from the University of Cambridge tells me.
More technology of business
One approach showing promise uses a technique developed by the University of Strathclyde.
It involves breaking the blades down into small pieces and feeding them into a very hot air stream.
The process separates the glass fibre from the resin. The glass fibre can then be collected, treated and reused, explains Malcolm Forsyth who leads Project PRoGrESS, which aims to commercialise the technology.
The project, which kicked off in 2022, is working on a pilot plant that's due to be operational in the first half of this year - though it's hit some difficulties.
""The major challenge for the project team has been the rapid escalation of material costs partly due to the Russia and Ukraine war, as well as global inflation,"" according to Mr Forsyth.
Similar solutions are being tested elsewhere that use different methodologies but have the same overarching goal of breaking down the materials used in wind turbine blades.
Danish company Vestas, the largest wind turbine producer in Europe, announced last year an approach that uses a liquid chemical solution to break down the blades into materials which can then potentially be used to make new blades.
A major advantage of this approach, according to Vestas, is that it uses widely available chemicals, though details haven't been disclosed. The process has the added benefit of not requiring energy-intensive high temperatures.
Both of these traits hint at potential scalability, with the company claiming to have recycled 475 end-of-life blades in 2022.
If technologies such as these succeed ""then not only can we solve the problem of new waste coming through, but we can also actually tackle historic waste,"" according to Dr Barlow.
Historic blade waste currently in landfill could be recycled, as could waste which has been placed in storage awaiting a solution.
At Hagshaw Hill a number of wind turbines have been kept in storage while ScottishPower Renewables decides what to do with them.
Perhaps the future will be to make turbine blades that are easier to break down.
A number of companies are working on building blades made out of materials less reliant on the difficult to recycle fibreglass and epoxy resin. However at this stage, the vast majority of blades continue to be made of these traditional materials.
The next few years will determine whether the recycling technology under development can be scaled-up to a useful size, without harming the environment.
As Dr Barlow puts it ""that really is the silver bullet.""

2024-02-09T05:16:05.000Z,Chocolate: Cocoa price hits record high as El Niño hurts crops,BBC News,"Global cocoa prices have hit a fresh record high as dry weather hurts crops in West Africa.
Cocoa prices on the New York commodities market reached a new all-time high of $5,874 (£4,655) a ton on Thursday.
The cost of the key ingredient for making chocolate has now roughly doubled since the start of last year.
Soaring cocoa prices are already filtering through to consumers and squeezing major chocolate makers.
On Thursday, one of the world's biggest chocolate manufacturers Hershey warned: ""Historic cocoa prices are expected to limit earnings growth this year.""
The company's chief executive Michele Buck also did not rule out putting up prices for customers.
""We can't talk about future pricing,"" she said in a call with analysts but added, ""given where cocoa prices are, we will be using every tool in our toolbox, including pricing, as a way to manage the business.""
The comments came as Hershey announced its financial results for the three months to 31 December. The figures showed sales fell by 6.6% as inflation-hit consumers cut back spending on confectionery.
Last month, Mondelez, the company behind the Cadbury brand, identified rising costs of ingredients as one of the challenges it faced in the year ahead.
Chief financial officer Luca Zaramella said the firm had seen ""significant increases in both cocoa and sugar"".
In December, UK consumer group Which? said the price of some festive chocolate boxes had risen by at least 50% in a year.
While overall inflation for UK supermarket food and drink eased in November to 8.3%, the rise in the chocolate prices was significantly higher at 15.3%.
Cocoa prices have been driven up by poor harvests in West Africa, which produces the bulk of global supply.
The El Niño weather phenomenon has been causing drier weather in Ghana and Ivory Coast, which are the world's two biggest producers of cocoa beans.
Hotter temperatures and shifts in rainfall patterns caused by climate change can also have an impact on harvests.
""Traders are worried about another short production year and these feelings have been enhanced by El Niño that is threatening West Africa crops with hot and dry weather,"" said Jack Scoville, an analyst at Price Futures Group.

2024-03-01T22:03:05.000Z,Rents soar in towns as tenants priced out of cities,BBC News,"Towns within commuting distance of major cities have seen some of the biggest rent rises of the last three years, new research suggests.
The cost of new lets rose by more than a third in areas such as Bolton and Newport between 2020 and 2023, property portal Zoopla said.
Although Glasgow, London, Manchester and Edinburgh also saw big rises, new working patterns have made an impact.
Working from home has allowed some to rent bigger places further from cities.
""They may only go into the office two or three times a week and, if they are in a flat, may have looked for a bit more room,"" said Richard Donnell, Zoopla's executive director of research.
Agents said there had been ""staggering"" levels of competition in areas with easy transport access to bigger cities.
The Zoopla figures, compiled for the BBC, tracked the rise in rents for people looking for somewhere new to let in 65 cities and large towns in the UK. Six of the 10 biggest increases were in areas with relatively easy access to major cities like London, Manchester, Leeds and Cardiff.
They included Wigan, Newport, Bradford, Rochdale and Luton.
But they were led by Bolton, where:
""There have been multiple offers on every single property,"" said Stuart Matthews, managing director at Miller Metcalfe estate and lettings agent, based in Bolton.
""The price can be put up by £100 a month, and it still goes.""
Having been in the business for 23 years, he described the last 18 months as ""staggering"" and unlike any other time he knew.
One attraction of Bolton is that the average rent for a new let is still lower than the neighbouring areas of Rochdale, Warrington, and Manchester (which includes Bury and Oldham in Zoopla's calculations).
""You get a lot more for your money in Bolton than you do in central Manchester - like a house instead of a flat,"" said Mr Matthews.
A two-bedroom terraced home typically costs about £800 a month to rent, he said. It was a draw for families, alongside shopping and schools.
Some renters may work in Manchester so commute or blend with working from home, and Bolton has transport links into central Manchester.
Although demand had been high, Mr Matthews said, the lack of available properties was an even bigger factor. Some landlords had left the sector, while buy-to-let investors were not taking on as many properties.
This lack of supply has been key to soaring rents across the UK.
The number of rented homes had barely changed since 2016, according to Mr Donnell from Zoopla, failing to keep pace with exceptional demand in the last couple of years.
He said that immigration, a relatively strong jobs market and the return of students since the pandemic had led to demand in cities, prompting some tenants to look further afield.
A recent survey by the website Save The Student found its users were finding high rent levels tough to cope with.
Among the students who paid rent, 64% said they struggled with the cost at least some of the time, including 20% who described it as a constant struggle.
Two in five said they had thought about dropping out of university due to the cost of rent.
Although rents are expected to keep rising, tenants should see the pace of growth fall quite sharply in the coming year, according to Mr Donnell.
He said there was a danger that some rents were being set beyond affordable levels, and there were signs of some rents being reduced on listings after failing to secure a tenant at a higher price.
Another property portal, Rightmove, also said there was an average of 15 enquiries for every available rental property at the start of this year, down from 20 a year earlier and the lowest queue to view since 2021.
The support provided through the benefits system to private renters through Local Housing Allowance rates was improved in Chancellor Jeremy Hunt's Autumn Statement.
However, campaigners are calling for more assistance and an acceleration in the proposed ban on no-fault evictions in England, which ministers have discussed watering down.
Agents say there are some simple ways to make it easier to secure a rental property, including:

The UK's largest building society said house prices were up 1.2% in February compared with a year ago.
Signs of activity have been seen in the UK housing market, with Bank of England figures on Thursday showing a rise in mortgage approvals.
But the Nationwide said the outlook was still ""highly uncertain"".
""The decline in borrowing costs around the turn of the year appears to have prompted an uptick in the housing market,"" said Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist.
""Nevertheless, near-term prospects remain highly uncertain, in part due to ongoing uncertainty about the future path of interest rates.""
On a month-on-month basis, house prices increased by 0.7% in February, according to the Nationwide's data, taking the average UK house price to £260,420.
However, it said that property prices remained 3% lower than their peak during the summer of 2022.
The Nationwide is one of the UK's biggest mortgage lenders. Its figures only take into account buyers with mortgages and do not include those who purchase homes with cash or buy-to-let deals.
According to the latest available official data, cash buyers currently account for over a third of housing sales.
Rising house prices at a time of relatively high mortgage rates may prove to be a problem for potential first-time buyers, who may look for government help when Chancellor Jeremy Hunt delivers his Budget on Wednesday.
However, analysts say some moves to boost the housing market can lead to house prices rises accelerating, and could drive up inflation.

The hourly pay rate for store workers will rise from £11.02 to £12.02 in April, while pay for workers in London will rise to £13.15 an hour.
More than 200,000 staff will benefit from the increase, Tesco said.
All staff will get the voluntary Real Living Wage, which is higher than the compulsory National Living Wage.
The National Living Wage, often referred to as the minimum wage, is set to rise to £11.44 an hour in April 2024 - and for the first time will include 21 and 22-year-olds.
As a result, many of the major supermarkets have been announcing pay deals over the past few weeks.
Tesco now joins Sainsbury's, Asda, Aldi, Lidl and M&S in increasing its minimum pay for staff outside of London to £12 per hour.
Aldi's higher pay has been in place since the start of February, while Lidl and Sainsbury's increased wage began in March. M&S's pay rise will begin in April, while Asda will bring in an interim increase on 1 April to £11.44 an hour before raising the rate to £12.04 an hour from 1 July.
As well as raising pay, Tesco also said it would be increasing paternity leave to six weeks fully paid.
In addition, Tesco said it would increase maximum company sick pay entitlement to 18 weeks for eligible colleagues.
The supermarket has dropped separate pay rates for inner London and outer London employees to create one London Allowance, and it said the £13.15 per hour rate for this area meant it kept in line with the voluntary London Real Living Wage.

Squishmallows, says Skoosherz, a new toy made by Build-A-Bear Workshop is too similar to its own egg-shaped cushion animal characters.
Despite the cuddly nature of the subject matter it will be more hard-nosed legal battle than pillow fight.
Jazwares, the maker of Squishmallows, has launched an intellectual property lawsuit in California.
But Build-A-Bear Workshop has launched its own lawsuit in retaliation in Missouri, aiming to establish that the Skoosherz, another dinner plate-sized huggable, is simply its own version of a type of toy that has become popular in recent years.
Jazwares, however, says the Skoozherz toys are ""knockoffs"" of the Squishmallows it has sold since 2017, pointing out they are also ""shaped fanciful renditions"" of animals, with ""simplified Asian style Kawaii faces,"" and ""velvety velour-like"" fabric.
Kawaii is a reference to the Japanese culture of cuteness.
""Build-A-Bear has gone to great lengths to copy the distinct look, feel, and tactile design of Squishmallows to capitalise on Squishmallows' global success blatantly and intentionally,"" Jazwares told the BBC in an email.
There was originally a small range of Squishmallows animals, including a fox, a cat, and a frog. They  became increasingly popular during the pandemic as people treated themselves to comforting items for their homes.
Squishmallows also went viral on TikTok, helped by celebrities including Lady Gaga and Kim Kardashian. There are now more than 1,000 different versions of them.
In 2022, US billionaire Warren Buffett's investment firm bought Jazwares' parent company Alleghany.
The proliferation of this type of velvety squashy toys has continued, with many versions widely available and Jazwares already has a case against Chinese online retailer Alibaba for allegedly selling counterfeits.
""When it comes to intellectual property rights, imitation is not the sincerest form of flattery,"" Jazwares' lawyer, Moez Kaba, said in a statement.
Build-A-Bear, which launched its Skoosherz range to tap into the popularity of soft toys in the run up to Valentine's Day, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The rules apply to firms that have received at least 30 million yuan ($4.2m; £3.3m) of government funding.
It comes as authorities move to support China's crisis-hit property industry.
In January, the country's housing ministry said it would offer more bailout loans to developers struggling with debt and a slowdown in demand.
Announcing the new surveillance rules in January, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) said in a statement that it was moving to ""regulate the implementation of projects and the use of funding"".
""These measures are important to strengthen investment supervision... and improve the effectiveness of government investment,"" it added.
The rules are part of the Chinese government's efforts to ensure that ""funds being used to prop up struggling property developers are being used for their intended purposes,"" Ben Harburg from investment firm MSA Capital told the BBC.
""Chinese developers have breached the trust of the Chinese government in the past by taking funds earmarked for completion of a project to pay off a coupon or even for personal use,"" he said.
Under the measures, security devices - including surveillance cameras, drones or even satellite equipment - must be used to monitor projects, if conditions allow.
The people of China are some of the most surveilled citizens in the world. It has been estimated that half of the world's surveillance cameras are in China, amounting to hundreds of millions of the devices.
All this is part of China's aim to build what it calls ""the world's biggest camera surveillance network"".
Many of the cameras use artificial intelligence, including facial recognition technology.
However, David Goodman, a professor of Chinese politics at The University of Sydney, said that he does not see the new rules as ""creepy, though there is an element of desperation,"" from the authorities to oversee state-sponsored projects.
""It is likely to have some results, and some of those may even be positive towards ensuring performance and social achievement,"" he added.
Mareike Ohlberg, a senior fellow at the think-tank German Marshall Fund of the United States, said she ""does not expect a move which is - at least in theory - geared towards monitoring how public funds are spent to generate a lot of backlash"" given ""widespread surveillance across the country"".
Project developers should also use other technologies like big data to detect problems quickly, according to the NDRC.
The BBC contacted several major Chinese developers - including Evergrande, Country Garden, Sunac and Longfor - for comment. None have yet responded.
The severe problems engulfing China's property market were highlighted this week as a court in Hong Kong ordered the liquidation of debt-laden developer Evergrande.
Evergrande, like many of its rivals, borrowed billions of dollars as it expanded aggressively.
However, rules were introduced in 2020 to control the amount large real estate firms could borrow. That helped trigger a crisis, which the industry is still struggling to overcome.
This presents a major issue for the Chinese government as the property sector accounts for roughly a quarter of the world's second largest economy.
""The property sector is the bellwether for the Chinese economy. Provincial governments depended on the sector to drive employment and meet growth targets. It is critical that the Chinese government shore up this sector to diffuse some global fears,"" Mr Harburg said.
Earlier this year, China's housing ministry announced plans to offer more bailout loans to developers ""in view of the current financing difficulties of some real estate projects"".
At the same time local governments have been asked to provide a list of projects that need support, the official newspaper of China's housing ministry reported.
Chinese lawmakers have also urged banks, which provided nearly 10 trillion yuan in loans to the property sector last year, to continue lending to struggling developers.
In January, to help free up funds to support the economy, China's central bank made the largest cut to mandatory reserves for banks in more than two years.
A day after the move, a senior official said the financial industry had an ""unshirkable responsibility"" to property developers.
""For projects that are in difficulty but whose funds can be balanced, we should not blindly withdraw loans, suppress loans, or cut off loans,"" Xiao Yuanqi from the National Financial Regulatory Administration told a news conference in Beijing.
""We should provide greater support through extending existing loans, adjusting repayment arrangements, and adding new loans.""
Troubles in the property sector have also prevented developers from completing projects, leaving millions of vacant units scattered across the country.
The crisis has already left many home buyers waiting for their new properties, in a country in which real estate accounts for around 70% of personal wealth.
""That could affect economic growth and potentially the stability of the financial system,"" said Ms Ohlberg.
Beijing has previously sought to temper public concerns as people have taken to Chinese social media sites such as Weibo to share their frustrations about developers.
""Housing affects social stability. If a lot of people buy properties that aren't built, that's a lot of people who will be very upset,"" she added.

2024-02-06T03:49:42.000Z,Yandex: Owner of 'Russia's Google' pulls out of home country,BBC News,"The owner of Yandex, often referred to as ""Russia's Google"", has said it will pull out of its country of origin.
Its Dutch-based parent company sold the operation in Russia for 475 billion roubles ($5.2bn; £4.2bn), much lower than its estimated market value.
The sale to a consortium of investors means Yandex's Russian business is now a fully Russian-owned entity.
The firm has previously been accused of hiding information about the war in Ukraine from the Russian public.
Moscow has welcomed the latest deal which the company said was ""the product of an extensive period of planning and negotiation over more than 18 months"".
""This is exactly what we wanted to achieve a few years ago when Yandex was under threat of being taken over by Western IT giants,"" said Anton Gorelkin, deputy head of the Russian parliament's committee on information policy.
""Yandex is more than a company, it is an asset of the entire Russian society,"" he added.
Set up in the dotcom boom in the late 1990s, Yandex developed its own search engine, mapping and advertising businesses. Other services include taxis and food delivery.
The $5.2bn deal is believed to be significantly lower than Yandex's market value, which was worth around $30bn in 2021.
Despite its nickname of 'Russia's Google', Yandex has no ties to the US search engine giant or its parent company Alphabet.
Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, many foreign-owned businesses have exited the country, often selling assets on unfavourable terms.
Russian president Vladimir Putin also ordered the seizure of others, such as assets belonging to Western brands Danone and Carlsberg.
Yandex's co-founder, Arkady Volozh, is one of very few top Russia-linked businessmen to have publicly spoken out against Russia's invasion of Ukraine. He left the firm in 2022.
Mr Volozh has been hit with sanctions by the European Union, which in 2022 said Yandex is ""responsible for promoting [Russian] state media and narratives in its search results, and deranking and removing content critical of the Kremlin, such as content related to Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine"".
He is seeking a European Union court to remove sanctions as he says he was never close to the Russian president Vladimir Putin.
To comply with the Russian government's demands over its content, Yandex sold some of its online resources to state-controlled rival VK in late 2022.
Even though Yandex presents itself as independent of the authorities, experiments by BBC Monitoring in 2022 showed that its search results failed to report Russian atrocities in Ukrainian city of Bucha.

2024-02-05T08:35:31.000Z,"Boeing in ‘last chance saloon’, warns Emirates boss",BBC News,"The boss of Emirates airline has warned Boeing is in the ""last chance saloon"", saying he had seen a ""progressive decline"" in its performance.
Boeing has come under scrutiny after a panel on a 737 Max 9 passenger jet blew off mid-air last month.
Emirates president Sir Tim Clark is a leading industry figure and the airline is a major Boeing customer.
He also told the Financial Times that Emirates would send its engineers to monitor Boeing's production lines.
In response to Sir Tim's remarks, Boeing pointed to comments its chief executive, Dave Calhoun, made last week, when he said: ""We understand why [customers] are angry and we will work to earn their confidence.""
Emirates told the BBC it had nothing to add to what Sir Tim said in the interview.
""They have got to instil this safety culture which is second to none. They've got to get their manufacturing processes under review so there are no corners cut etc,"" Sir Tim said.
""I'm sure Dave Calhoun and [commercial head] Stan Deal are on that... this is the last chance saloon,"" he added.
Sir Tim was preparing to send Emirates engineers to monitor Boeing's production lines for the first time.
He said the engineers would observe the production process of the 777 at Boeing and its supplier Spirit AeroSystems.
Emirates is one of Boeing's biggest customers.
In November, it placed an order for 95 wide-body Boeing 777 and 787 jets, used for long-haul flights, valued at $52bn (£41.2bn) at list prices.
But Boeing hit the headlines in recent weeks despite the Mr Calhoun insisting the company had changed since he took over after former boss Dennis Muilenburg was fired.
On 5 January a door plug on an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 blew off shortly after take-off, terrifying passengers, and forcing an emergency return to the Portland, Oregon airport.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) launched an investigation of Boeing's manufacturing process and barred the firm from expanding production of its popular 737 Max planes.
Some of the company's biggest airline customers have also expressed concerns, noting that the issues may delay approval of new versions of the 737 Max plane, the Max 7 and Max 10, that are in the works.
In 2018, a similar incident to what happened last month occurred to an older model of Boeing 737 being operated by Southwest Airlines. Debris from an engine failure broke one of the cabin windows while the plane was travelling at 32,000ft. It resulted in one passenger being partially sucked out of the window and she died from her injuries.
The company's safety record has also been tarnished due to two crashes in late 2018 off the coast of Indonesia and in early 2019 outside Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa.
A total of 346 people were killed in the crashes, which were caused by flawed flight control software.

The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (Austrac) had ordered an external audit of the firm in 2022.
Bet365 did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment.
The industry has come under increased scrutiny after online betting surged in during the pandemic.
""Businesses without adequate processes in place to manage those risks leave themselves vulnerable to exploitation by criminals,"" said Brendan Thomas, the CEO of the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (Austrac).
Austrac investigates banks, casinos and betting companies to make sure they have robust compliance systems to prevent them from profiting from the proceeds of crime.
Ladbrokes owner Entain has also been probed in Australia since 2022, while another rival Sportsbet is facing an external audit.
Under Australian law, firms are required to assess customers and monitor their financial transactions in order to identify, mitigate and manage the risk that they might be engaging in money laundering or financing terrorism.
Any companies found by Austrac to have weak compliance systems could be fined.
In recent years the watchdog has hit major lenders Westpac and Commonwealth Bank of Australia with large fines for breaches of the anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws.
The online betting industry also faces other challenges in Australia such as new laws banning the use of credit cards for online gambling and stricter federal government rules on adverts.
Last year, Bet365 reported a significant loss but its chief executive Denise Coates was paid around £221m.
That was £7m higher than the previous year and Ms Coates also received at least £50m worth of dividends.
The pay bump means that her total salary over the past four years surpassed £1bn.
Ms Coates founded the Bet365 website in a portable building in a Stoke-on-Trent car park more than 20 years ago.
She is thought to be one of Britain's richest women and among the best-paid executives in the world.

A firm called Ever Credit Ltd filed the case for non-payment of a loan worth HK$1.6bn ($204.5m; £161.2m).
Country Garden, which defaulted on its overseas debt in October, says it will ""resolutely oppose"" the petition.
Last month, rival real estate giant China Evergrande was ordered to liquidate by a Hong Kong court.
The court has set the first hearing date for the petition on 17 May, Country Garden said in a statement to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.
Ever Credit is a unit of Kingboard Holdings, a laminates maker and property investor.
Shares in Country Garden fell more than 10% in early Hong Kong trade following the announcement.
Country Garden did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment.
""The filing of winding-up petition against Country Garden is not surprising for us,"" Jason Sze from personal finance firm iFAST Financial told the BBC.
It comes a month after Evergrande, the world's most indebted property developer, was ordered to be liquidated by a Hong Kong court.
The firm has been the poster child of China's real estate crisis with more than $300bn (£236bn) of debt.
Liquidators have been appointed to look at Evergrande's overall financial position and identify potential restructuring strategies.
That could include seizing and selling off assets, so that the proceeds can be used to repay outstanding debts.
However, the Chinese government may be reluctant to see work halt on property developments in China, where many ordinary would-be homeowners are waiting for apartments they have already paid for.
Mr Sze does not expect Country Garden to face a forced liquidation order like Evergrande.
""We believe that the company will launch an offshore debt restructuring plan as soon as possible to fend off the winding-up petition and settle the defaulted debts,"" he said.
Problems in China's property market are having a major impact as the sector accounts for a third of the economy.
The industry has been facing a major financial squeeze since 2021, when authorities introduced measures to curb the amount big real estate companies could borrow.
Since then several large property developers have defaulted on their debts in the last few years.

2024-02-22T18:18:02.000Z,"HSBC, NatWest and Virgin Money changing interest rates",BBC News,"More mortgage providers will increase their rates on new fixed deals on Friday following a series of changes since the start of the year.
January saw lenders cutting their rates sharply, bringing some relief to 1.6 million people set to remortgage this year.
But higher costs faced by providers to fund mortgage lending means many have raised rates again in recent days.
HSBC, NatWest and Virgin Money are all increasing the cost of new deals.
This will mean the end of widely available five-year fixed deals with a rate of less than 4%. The average rate on all new fixed deals has been edging higher recently as lenders have altered their pricing.
""This may catch some borrowers by surprise when the rate story this year has generally been one of falling rates,"" said David Hollingworth, from broker London and Country.
He said lenders had been shifting rates regularly. They are responding to the view of investors who now expect the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee to make fewer, and later, changes its base rate of 5.25% this year than previously anticipated. Cuts in this rate makes borrowing less expensive.
The interest rate on a fixed mortgage does not change until the deal expires, usually after two or five years, and a new one is chosen to replace it. Doing nothing would leave people on a variable rate, which is very expensive.
About 1.6 million existing borrowers have relatively cheap fixed-rate deals expiring this year.
Santander, Coventry Building Society and TSB all raised rates on new fixed deals earlier in the week.
""HSBC's best buy deals were never going to last long once Santander pushed up its fixed rates,"" said Aaron Strutt, of mortgage broker Trinity Financial.
""While they have gone up, [deals] are still reasonably priced. Some lenders now offer two-year fixed-rates priced around 4.4% and five-year fixes priced around 4.2%.
""Lenders have had a busy start to the year and the property market has really picked up. These rate hikes may well start to knock the property sector again if they continue.""
Andrew Montlake, managing director of Coreco mortgage brokers, said: ""There is massive sense of deja vu as several mainstream lenders have increased their rates with little notice in a throwback to the dark days of 2023.
""This all makes life extremely difficult for those trying to find a new mortgage, as once again, quick decisions are needed or carefully worked out budgets need to be revisited, which can sometimes mean the difference between obtaining their dream home or not.""
However, there are signs of lenders failing to settle on where rates should be set. Halifax, part of Lloyds Banking Group, is cutting the rates on some of its deals on Friday.
""I expect there will still be plenty of jockeying for position as the market remains extremely competitive but in the short term we may still see more movement in mortgage rates,"" Mr Hollingworth said.

2024-02-14T05:03:21.000Z,Amazon founder Jeff Bezos sells shares worth over $4bn,BBC News,"Multi-billionaire Jeff Bezos has sold more of his shares in Amazon, bringing the total value of sales in recent days to more than $4bn (£3.2bn).
The technology giant, which Mr Bezos founded in 1994, said he has sold 24 million Amazon shares this month.
Mr Bezos, who is the firm's executive chair, last sold Amazon shares in 2021.
The company previously said he was planning to sell 50 million shares over the next year, which are worth around $8.4bn at current prices.
The first sale of 12 million shares was announced in a regulatory filing on Friday, followed by an announcement on Tuesday of the sale of another 12 million shares.
Mr Bezos has also given away shares in Amazon as part of his philanthropy, most recently in 2022.
As Mr Bezos moved to Miami in Florida from Seattle in Washington last year, he will save around $280m in tax on the $4bn worth of stock he has sold.
Gains above $250,000 from the sale of shares or other long term investments, are taxed at 7% in Washington state. Florida does not have state taxes on incomes or capital gains.
However, he will still be liable to federal taxes as a result of selling the shares.
When Mr Bezos announced his move to Florida it prompted speculation over whether it was because of a potential tax bill he would have faced in Washington after the state approved a new tax on large stock sales.
His sales of Amazon shares come after they have risen by almost 70% in the past year.
Mr Bezos said in November that his parents had recently moved back to Miami where he spent some of his childhood and that he wanted to be close to them and to his Blue Origin space project, which was ""increasingly shifting to Cape Canaveral"".
""Lauren and I love Miami,"" he wrote on Instagram, referring to his fiancée Lauren Sánchez.
""For all that, I'm planning to return to Miami, leaving the Pacific Northwest,"" he added.
Mr Bezos remains Amazon's biggest shareholder and is one of the richest people in the world, with an estimated fortune of more than $190bn.

2024-02-20T03:29:04.000Z,Daiso: Billionaire founder of Japanese discount store dies,BBC News,"Hirotake Yano, the billionaire founder of Japanese discount retailer Daiso, has died of heart failure, aged 80.
In a statement released on Monday, the firm said he passed away on 12 February and a private funeral had already been held by close family members.
Daiso is a so-called 100 yen ($0.67; £0.53) store, similar to pound shops.
Mr Yano opened his first discount retailer in 1972 and was seen as a pioneer of the dollar shop business model.
""It's with profound sadness that we announce the passing of Founder and Former President of Daiso Industries Company Limited, Mr Hirotake Yano, last Monday,"" Daiso said on its website.
A commemoration gathering will be held in the near future, the release added.
After graduating from Tokyo's Chuo University in 1967, Mr Yano had several different jobs, including running his father-in-law's fishery until it went bankrupt.
In 1972, at the age of 29, he set up his first business, a street vending shop called Yano Shoten, or Yano Store.
Five years later, he changed the name of the company to Daiso, which translates to ""create something big"". It became famous for all of its items costing 100 yen each.
Mr Yano said that he and his wife Katsuyo found that having to price products differently was too time-consuming so they decided to charge 100 yen for every item.
Daiso became successful as the Japanese economy stagnated in the 1990s and customers became more price conscious.
The business model that Mr Yano pioneered is now popular worldwide.
As of the end of 2023, Daiso had 4,360 stores in its home country and almost 1,000 shops around the world, with outlets across Asia as well in North America and the Middle East.
Like the discount stores Mr Yano inspired, Daiso has had to adapt its approach to pricing and now sells goods at multiples of 100 yen.
It has more than 70,000 different items in stock, and says that it develops over 1,000 new products a month.
The company calls itself ""Japan's No.1 living ware supplier"".
Mr Yano had a net worth of $1.9bn, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

2024-02-07T11:19:13.000Z,Pension income needed to retire jumps as family costs rise,BBC News,"A single person will need £31,300 a year for a moderate income in retirement, according to a pensions industry body.
The rising cost of living and an expectation to offer financial support to grandchildren had pushed up the income required by £8,000, it said.
The Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association (PLSA) uses evidence from focus groups to make the estimates.
It is intended as a guide for those planning their retirement savings.
The rise is primarily the result of rising food and energy costs, researchers said.
The calculations are pitched at three different levels - minimum, moderate and comfortable - and are developed and maintained independently by the Centre for Research in Social Policy at Loughborough University.
They estimated that a single person needed £14,400 a year for a minimum income, and £43,100 a year for a comfortable retirement.
Couples required a joint £22,400 at the minimum level, £43,100 at a moderate level, and £59,000 at a comfortable level.
Nigel Peaple, director policy and advocacy at the PLSA, said: ""The cost of living has put enormous pressure on household finances over the last year and, as the research shows, this is no different for retirees.""
Professor Matt Padley, from Loughborough University, said the research highlighted the increasing importance people placed on spending time with family and friends out of the home, as priorities had changed following the pandemic.
For example, in-depth discussion groups considered that at the moderate level of retirement, people should be able to have a monthly meal out with their loved ones and help their family members financially with a budget of £1,000, such as helping with grandchildren's activities.
Under the estimates:
None include housing costs, because many pensioners have paid off a mortgage, while those who rent often have a benefit entitlement to help them pay.
The amount someone needs to save during their working life to reach these levels of retirement income is a complicated and highly speculative calculation.
That is because of changes over such a long time, the variety of pensions options, and lots of variables.
In very simple terms:
All this incorporates people also receiving the full state pension. The calculations are based on today's prices and make a host of other assumptions. For example, annuity rates change, so experts stress this can only be an illustration.
The triple-lock, which is used to uprate the state pension, acted as a crucial safeguard against rising retirement living costs, researchers said. It will rise by 8.5% in April to just over £11,500 a year.
In addition, workers are now automatically enrolled into a pension scheme, taking a chunk of income and putting it into a pension pot, unless employees opt-out. A government spokesman said this had ""transformed pension saving"" and would be expanded.
Pensions commentators described the estimates as a wake-up call. The amount needed for a moderate income, according to the estimates, is similar to the median average gross annual earnings of a full-time employees, which official statistics show is £34,963.
A separate report by provider Now Pensions and the Pensions Policy Institute has suggested that, typically, women face needing to work for an extra 19 years to retire with the same pension savings as men.
Carole Whyatt, a pensions campaigner, said: ""I've heard a couple of people say, well, you wanted equality with the men, and you've got it.""
She said inheritance money helped her get through.
""If it hadn't have been for the money that came to me when my mum died, which was shared out between the family, we wouldn't have survived. We wouldn't have managed. I genuinely don't know what we'd have done to get through,"" she said.
The report said women retired on average with pension savings of £69,000, compared with £205,000 for men. Options from these savings include keeping them invested and partially drawn as an income, or used to buy an annuity which provides an annual pension income.

2024-02-08T00:01:02.000Z,"Source oil and gas locally, urges Equinor energy boss",BBC News,"Countries should secure supplies of oil and gas by sourcing locally, the boss of energy giant Equinor has said.
Anders Opedal told the BBC energy security should be top of the agenda after Russia's invasion of Ukraine saw supplies disrupted and prices hiked.
Equinor is the biggest investor in the Rosebank oil field in the North Sea - the largest new UK oil and gas field development in decades.
But critics say new oil fields will not make UK energy supplies more secure.
They argue a faster transition away from fossil fuels is a better strategy to ensure more stable energy prices..
It was given the green light the day after the International Energy Agency announced that any new oil and gas developments were inconsistent with an international target of keeping the global temperature from rising more than 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels.
But Mr Opedal defended Equinor's investment in Rosebank, pointing to the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on supplies of oil and gas to Europe.
""One of the key learnings from 2022 is that energy security needs to be on top of the agenda, together with affordability and sustainability,"" he said.
""Each country needs to, I think, look harder into producing the energy they need closer to home, and that's really what we are working on to make sure we can supply Europe, the UK, with gas and oil these days and for decades to come.""
Mr Opedal said that Equinor was taking what he described as ""a balanced view"" of the transition away from fossil fuels. He said that investment in renewables would rise from its current 20% of capital expenditure to 50% by 2030.
""We are investing in Rosebank but we are also investing in Dogger Bank - the world's largest windfarm,"" he said.
""We know that, in time, demand for oil and gas will decline and we are preparing our company for that. We are investing in the energy of the future while supplying the energy the world needs now,"" he said.
However, there is a chorus of voices opposing new investment in oil and gas, arguing it makes countries less secure.
The head of the United Nations, António Guterres, said in 2022 that investment in new oil and gas was ""economic and moral madness"".
Piers Forster, the interim chair of parliament's Climate Change Committee said by contrast shifting to renewables would help keep prices stable.
""The more we reduce our dependence on fossil fuels that are sold on international markets, the less energy prices will fluctuate,"" he said.
Most oil produced in UK waters is not sold directly onto the UK market, but is traded by the private companies that extract it, with the price set by the global market. Much of the UK's North Sea gas does come into the country, but still at internationally determined prices.
Claire Fyson, from the think tank, Climate Analytics, said the UK should be cutting fossil fuel use by 6% a year rather than investing in new developments.
""Numerous studies have shown we'll have a big surplus in fossil fuels if planned projects go ahead, creating huge risks for not only the climate but also the economy,"" she said.
Mr Opedal said attacks on shipping in the Red Sea did not affect Equinor much directly, because it does not sail much oil through the waterway.
However he said geo-political events in Ukraine and the Middle East were keeping prices at a higher level.
""It's too early to say but normally all these geopolitical events keep prices at a higher level than normal supply and demand,"" he said.
He added that with Russian oil now largely redirected towards Asia, replaced in Europe by oil from Norway and Europe increasing the number of LNG terminals, there was now greater price stability than in 2022.
""I wouldn't say this is the new normal, because what is normal in an energy market?  But energy is now more affordable and prices are no longer at a level where it hampers economic growth,"" he said.

Hi-Fi Rush and pirate game Sea of Thieves are coming to Sony's PS5 only.
Meanwhile, narrative adventure game Pentiment and co-op game Grounded will be on PS5 as well as Nintendo Switch.
It follows Microsoft's announcement in February that four Xbox exclusives would soon appear on rival platforms, in what some considered a major change of direction for the industry,
Until now, it had not been known what those titles were.
Two of the games were revealed on Wednesday in a Nintendo Direct, an online showcase for the firm, before Microsoft confirmed the full list in a blog post.
""These multiplayer titles available will bring more people together and continue to grow their communities of players,"" said head of Xbox game studios Matt Booty.
Neil Watton, editor of TheXboxHub, said fans would not be too surprised by the names of the games that were chosen to appear on other consoles, after several weeks of rumours.
""It's those jumping into Grounded and Sea of Thieves who will ultimately be rewarded, with full cross-play across platforms building the player base immediately on launch in April,"" he told the BBC.
""When you consider the depth of the cooperative play found in those titles, the moves make complete and utter sense.""
Several other upcoming titles for the Nintendo Switch were also revealed during Nintendo's event, including a new Endless Ocean game, Monster Hunter Stories, and a remake of 2010 Disney hit Epic Mickey.
Viewers were also surprised by the developers of the 2017 hit, Sonic Mania, unexpectedly announcing their latest game.
Penny's Big Breakaway, made by Evening Star, is a platform game with a distinctively 1990s look.
""I think the 3D platformer genre at the moment is actually in a bit of a renaissance"", the developer's director Christian Whitehead told the BBC.
""There's a lot to choose from, even just on Steam and Nintendo Switch"", he added.
Evening Star was formed by many of the people who worked on Sonic Mania as independent contractors.
That game was a hit in 2017, picking up an average score of 86 on review aggregator Metacritic alongside a nomination at that year's Game Awards.
Though a sequel to that game was highly anticipated by fans it never came to pass, and Sega instead released Sonic Superstars in 2023, made by Sonic's original designer.
Sonic and Mario - the mascots of Sega and Nintendo - were considered rivals in the 1990s, but after Sega stopped making its own consoles in the 2000s, it began releasing Sonic on rival consoles.
Nowadays, Sonic games appear on Nintendo, Sony and Microsoft hardware.
Argick, a Scottish Twitch streamer with about 20,000 followers, said he planned on spending his evening playing Penny's Big Breakaway on stream.
""Sonic Mania was a phenomenal critical success, fans and critics loved it,"" he told the BBC.
""Just looking at the footage for Penny's Big Breakaway, it looks really smooth, fluid, speedy and fun - really simple to pick up and play.
""But it's also really silly and not taking itself too seriously.""

The existing Act has been dubbed a ""snoopers charter"" by critics and this is not the first time Apple has lashed out against proposals to increase its scope.
The tech giant said in July 2023 it would consider pulling services such as Facetime and iMessage from the UK rather than compromise future security.
But the proposed UK law would go beyond just FaceTime and iMessage to encompass all Apple products.
Earlier in January, civil liberties groups including Big Brother Watch, Liberty, Open Rights Group and Privacy International, put out a joint briefing opposing parts of the bill.
The groups said they were concerned the proposed changes would ""force technology companies, including those based overseas, to inform the government of any plans to improve security or privacy measures on their platforms so that the government can consider serving a notice to prevent such changes"".
They added this would be ""effectively transforming private companies into arms of the surveillance state and eroding the security of devices and the internet.""
These proposed amendments follow a review of the existing legislation and include a range of updates around the collection of data by intelligence agencies and the use of internet connection records.

2024-03-13T11:59:32.000Z,MEPs approve world's first comprehensive AI law,BBC News,"The European Parliament has approved the world's first comprehensive framework for constraining the risks of artificial intelligence (AI).
The sector has seen explosive growth - driving huge profits but also stoking fears about bias, privacy and even the future of humanity.
The AI Act works by classifying products according to risk and adjusting scrutiny accordingly.
The law's creators said it would make the tech more ""human-centric.""
""The AI act is not the end of the journey but the starting point for new governance built around technology,"" MEP Dragos Tudorache added.
It also places the EU at the forefront of global attempts to address the dangers associated with AI.
China already has introduced a patchwork of AI laws. In October 2023, US President Joe Biden announced an executive order requiring AI developers to share data with the government.
But the EU has now gone further.
""The adoption of the AI Act marks the beginning of a new AI era and its importance cannot be overstated,"" said Enza Iannopollo, principal analyst at Forrester.
""The EU AI Act is the world's first and only set of binding requirements to mitigate AI risks,"" she added.
She said it would make the EU the ""de facto"" global standard for trustworthy AI, leaving every other region, including the UK, to ""play catch-up.""
In November 2023, the UK hosted an AI safety summit but is not planning legislation along the lines of the AI Act.
The main idea of the law is to regulate AI based on its capacity to cause harm to society. The higher the risk, the stricter the rules.
AI applications that pose a ""clear risk to fundamental rights"" will be banned, for example some of those that involve the processing of biometric data.
AI systems considered ""high-risk"", such as those used in critical infrastructure, education, healthcare, law enforcement, border management or elections, will have to comply with strict requirements.
Low-risk services, such as spam filters, will face the lightest regulation - the EU expects most services to fall into this category.
The Act also creates provisions to tackle risks posed by the systems underpinning generative AI tools and chatbots such as OpenAI's ChatGPT.
These would require producers of some so-called general-purpose AI systems, that can be harnessed for a range of tasks, to be transparent about the material used to train their models and to comply with EU copyright law.
Mr Turodache told reporters ahead of the vote that copyright provisions had been one of the ""heaviest lobbied"" parts of the bill.
OpenAI, Stability AI and graphics chip giant Nvidia are among a handful of AI firms facing lawsuits over their use of data to train generative models.
Some artists, writers and musicians have argued the process of ""scraping"" huge volumes of data, including potentially their own works, from virtually all corners of the internet violates copyright laws.
The Act still has to pass several more steps before it formally becomes law.
Lawyer-linguists, whose job is to check and translate laws, will scour its text and the European Council - composed of representatives of EU member states - will also need to endorse it, though that is expected to be a formality.
In the meantime, businesses will be working out how to comply with the legislation.
Kirsten Rulf - a former advisor to the German government, and now a partner at Boston Consulting Group - says more than 300 firms have been in touch with her company so far.
""They want to know how to scale the tech, and get value from AI,"" she told the BBC.
""Businesses need and want the legal certainty.""

2024-02-13T10:01:39.000Z,Three apologises again as some still without mobile service,BBC News,"Three has again apologised to ""a small number of customers"" without service after it fixed the ""vast majority"" of issues affecting its network.
Downdetector, which tracks outages, showed more than 12,000 of the telecom firm's customers reported calling and mobile data were not working on Monday.
It is the latest outage to hit Three, after it apologised on both Saturday and Sunday over similar incidents.
The firm said it was ""very sorry for the inconvenience this has caused"".
""Following an issue with our network that started yesterday, the vast majority of services have been restored,"" it said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.
""However, a small number of customers may be still experiencing an issue with voice calls.
""Unless your query is urgent, we'd advise against contacting us as wait times are likely to be very long.""
Previously, the firm told users that its customer service channels were unavailable, so they should follow its social media feeds for updates.
Three has around 10.5m customers across the UK, according to its website, but it is unclear how many of them are affected by the outages as those who rely on mobile internet may be unable to report the issue.
Reports began over the latest incident at 1000 GMT on 12 February, with frustrated customers taking to social media to voice their concerns - with some even threatening to leave the network altogether.
There have also been reports of the outages affecting some people using smaller providers which use Three's network, as there have been 800 reports from customers of one such firm - Smarty - according to Downdetector.
It is unclear whether customers will be able to claim compensation for the outage, although according to the website of telecoms regulator Ofcom, it ""may be appropriate"" for providers to offer refunds ""while repairs are being made"".
The outages come two weeks after the UK's competition watchdog announced it was investigating a proposed merger between Three and Vodafone.
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) will look into whether the deal could harm consumers by leading to reduced choice or higher prices - as it would create the UK's biggest mobile network.
The firms said the deal would result in an additional investment of £11bn in the UK.

2024-03-12T16:26:13.000Z,"TikTok: What is it, how does it work and could the US ban it?",BBC News,"The TikTok video app is hugely popular with young people around the world.
But for many years the Chinese-owned company has faced questions over the security of users' data, and its links to the government in Beijing.
US politicians are debating legislation that would force TikTok's parent company to sell the app, but former US president Donald Trump has criticised the bill, despite previously supporting a ban.
TikTok is a short form video app that, like YouTube, allows people to post, share and comment on videos.
These can range from three seconds to three minutes in length, and users can easily edit their clips using filters, stickers, music and visual effects.
It first shot to popularity as a destination for young people to take part in popular dance or lip-syncing trends and challenges.
Depending on their age and where they live, some users can live stream video content to their followers, as well as support their favourite creators with digital gifts or subscriptions.
TikTok Shop, the platform's dedicated online store, allows users to buy products including those featured in creators' videos.
Since early 2019, TikTok has frequently topped app download charts.
It battled Instagram to be the world's most downloaded app throughout 2023, according to Sensor Tower, which monitors the performance of social media firms.
TikTok reached 150 million US monthly active users in March 2023.
TikTok is owned by Chinese company ByteDance, which was founded in 2012.
The Beijing-based firm is registered in the Cayman Islands, and has offices across Europe and the US.
It also owns video editing software CapCut, as well as various other apps that are only available in mainland China - including Douyin, a Chinese version of TikTok.
Singaporean entrepreneur Shou Zi Chew is the platform's chief executive officer, although some analysts believe ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming makes many key decisions.
At the heart of TikTok is its algorithm.
This is a set of instructions within the app which determines which content is presented to users, based on data about how they engaged with previous material.
Users are offered three main feeds on their app - Following, Friends and For You.
The Following and Friends feeds present users with content from people they have chosen to follow and who follow them back, but the For You feed is automatically generated by the app.
This curated feed has become the main destination for users hungry for new content, and creators hungry for the millions of views TikTok videos can clock up if they go viral.
Politicians and regulators around the world are worried about TikTok's Chinese owners, despite concerted attempts to persuade them that the app is safe.
Like many other social media apps, TikTok collects data from users, but it has faced additional scrutiny over how much it gathers and who can access it.
In particular critics fear that the information could fall into the hands of the Chinese government - something TikTok and ByteDance have strenuously denied could happen.
In late 2022 a UK journalist discovered she had been tracked via her cat's account.
And in 2023 a number of institutions - including the UK government and Parliament, the EU and the US White House - banned staff from using the app on work phones.
TikTok has repeatedly sought to distance itself from its Chinese owners, and has tried to reassure regulators with initiatives such as ""Project Clover"", which started storing European user data locally.
US politicians from both major parties introduced a bill in March 2024 to tackle firms controlled ""by a foreign adversary"".
If successful, it would require ByteDance to sell TikTok within six months, or face a ban from US app stores and web hosting platforms.
President Joe Biden says he will sign the bill into law if it reaches his desk.
It follows previous efforts by American authorities to limit access to the app, citing national security risks.
Former US President Donald Trump unsuccessfully tried to ban the app when he was in the White House in 2020.
But Mr Trump - who hopes to be the Republican candidate for the 2024 presidential election - has criticised the new bill, saying limiting TikTok would unfairly benefit Facebook.

2024-03-11T19:37:39.000Z,Reddit aims for $6.4bn valuation ahead of initial public offering,BBC News,"Reddit, one of the most popular websites in the world, is hoping for a valuation of up to $6.4bn (£5bn) when its shares go public next week.
The social media company, which has never made a profit, will float shares on the New York Stock Exchange.
A filing in the US revealed that Reddit and its investors are hoping to sell 22 million shares for between $31 and $34 each.
However, many users worry the move will fundamentally change the website.
Some shares will be specially reserved for some Reddit users and moderators.
The company is planning an initial public offering (IPO) which would make some of its shares publicly available to buy for the first time.
""Our users have a deep sense of ownership over the communities they create on Reddit,"" wrote co-founder Steve Huffman in a letter to prospective investors released a few weeks ago.
""We want this sense of ownership to be reflected in real ownership - for our users to be our owners. Becoming a public company makes this possible.""
Reddit, which was founded almost 20 years ago, is an online forum where users can post questions and comment on topics that interest them.
The company makes most of its money through advertising on the platform, although it recently struck a deal with Google which allows the tech giant to access Reddit data to train its artificial intelligence (AI) models.
Reddit has recorded losses every year since its start, including more than $90m last year.
The valuation is also far less than the $10bn at which it was valued in a private fundraising round in 2021.
Currently, the biggest shareholders include media company Advance Magazine Publishers, Chinese tech firm Tencent, US investment firm Fidelity, and Sam Altman, the chief executive of ChatGPT makers OpenAI.
Reddit, founded in 2005, has a different feel compared with other social media companies such as Facebook or TikTok.
Users often feel freer to write what they like, although subreddits are policed by moderators.
The power of Reddit communities has been seen through examples such as the Gamestop saga in 2021, where users mobilised to drive up the share price of the US video game retailer.
Shares which were initially worth $20 shot up to a peak of $350 after co-ordination from Redditors.
However, some users are worried that the IPO would change the site for the worse.
""When the most important customers shift from [users] to shareholders, the product always [suffers],"" said one person.
""It becomes 'what can we do this quarter to squeak out an additional point of revenue', instead of 'how can we make this product better'.""

2024-01-17T15:10:24.000Z,"Gamers at risk of irreversible hearing loss and tinnitus, study suggests",BBC News,"People who play video games are at risk of damaging their hearing due to potentially unsafe sound levels, a study has found.
The new review suggests that gamers play for long periods of time with the volume turned up, beyond safe limits.
It says this could contribute to irreversible hearing loss or tinnitus, a constant ringing in the ears.
The paper, published in BMJ Public Health, reviewed 14 studies which in total involved more than 50,000 people.
The researchers urge more public health efforts to raise awareness of the issues for gamers, in the same way that has been done for live music and headphones.
Of course, gamers could turn down the volume while playing to minimise the risk, but the study suggests that part of the problem is the length of time people spend being exposed to high volumes.
For example, the World Health Organization (WHO) says adults can safely be exposed to 80 decibels (dB) for 40 hours a week, which is about the noise level of a doorbell.
Above that level, however, the safe amount of exposure to noise drops rapidly.
Adults should only listen to 90dB for four hours a week, and 95dB for one hour and 15 minutes a week, according to the WHO guidance. For children, the thresholds are even lower.
One of the studies evaluated by researchers found average headphone noise levels in four shooting games to be between 88.5 and 91.2dB.
Another study found that impulse sounds - short loud bursts such as shooting noises - reached 119dB.
The paper also found that in three separate studies, boys were recorded as playing videos games more often than girls for longer stints and at higher volumes.
Some studies found correlations between gaming and hearing loss while other linked the activity with tinnitus. These used a combination of self-reported data and hearing tests to evaluate hearing.
The authors acknowledge that more research should be done to establish a stronger link between gaming and hearing loss.
They add that the impact of e-sports, geographic region, sex and age should be looked into more closely.
Some of the studies they looked at went back to the 1990s, when the gaming world was very different to now.
Only two papers published in the last 10 years objectively measured sound levels from video games or gaming centres, which are like video game arcades and popular in Asia.
But the authors conclude that ""the limited available evidence suggests that gaming may be a common source of unsafe listening"".
They say: ""The findings suggest that there may be a need to prioritise interventions, such as initiatives focused on education and awareness of the potential risks of gaming, that can help promote safe listening among gamers.""
Gaming industry body Ukie said it continues to encourage people to use headphones within safe levels but would not comment further on the new study.

2024-02-24T00:03:30.000Z,Piers Morgan and Oprah Winfrey 'deepfaked' for US influencer's ads,BBC News,"Celebrities including Piers Morgan, Nigella Lawson and Oprah Winfrey have criticised the use of AI deepfake online adverts that gave the false impression they had endorsed a US influencer's controversial self-help course.
The adverts promoted the so-called ""Genie Script"", the centrepiece of a ""manifestation"" course sold for $37 (£29) a time by Wesley ""Billion Dollar"" Virgin.
He describes himself as a motivational coach who has 1.1 million followers on Instagram and claims to be worth $40m.
The videos, used to lure buyers to purchase the product, claim the Genie Script is a ""missing"" Hebrew Bible scripture of just 20 words that could - supposedly - change your life.
Its promotion blends pseudo-science, conspiracy theories and the manipulation of celebrity likenesses - all to draw in customers desperate for the chance to take control of their fate.
One advert used footage of Nigella Lawson chatting about her recipes and work as a TV chef.
""I went on vacation and met this man at a very exclusive party. His name was Wesley and he handed me this hidden Bible page that was locked away in somebody's room,"" the voice said.
But it was not that of Lawson, it was the barely indistinguishable mimicry of an AI voice generator.
Real footage is overlaid with a deepfake impersonation of the food writer's voice, making it sound like she was attributing her success directly to Wesley Virgin's guidance.
The AI voice suggested that the script revealed by Virgin unlocked the secret to manifestation, a practice which involves thinking about or writing down your aspirations to turn them into reality.
""He said: 'Repeat this mantra every single day of your life… Since that moment I've become a multimillionaire all on my own.""
A spokesperson for Lawson branded the advertisement ""fraudulent"" and ""of great concern"".
Another advert showed what looked like an excerpt from the Piers Morgan Uncensored TV show and employed similar techniques.
The voice described ""a lost old scripture that has been used by kings to attract vast riches, miraculous healing and unparalleled love"", and it looked like the mouth had been manipulated to fit the speech.
The real Piers Morgan told the BBC the advert was ""another example of a very worrying trend of public figures being misused by deepfake AI manipulators for financial gain"".
""The real victims will be members of the public who unwittingly buy these products believing the celebrity endorsements are genuine,"" he said.
""Reviews"" of the script appear online, where users praise Virgin and say they hope the script will help them with escaping poverty or spending more time with their children or grandchildren.
Both adverts, which appeared on YouTube, have now been taken down.
A spokesperson for YouTube said it had ""long prohibited the use of manipulated media, including deepfakes and other forms of doctored content to deceive or mislead users"".
Having reviewed these videos, Prof Hany Farid, a digital forensics expert at the University of California, Berkeley, said they were ""clearly deepfakes"".
""Of course, as the technology to create these fake audio and video improves, it will become increasingly difficult to detect these fakes. And the technology is improving at a stunning rate,"" he added.
Another advert, this time featuring Oprah Winfrey, was discovered in the Ad Library for the Meta platforms Facebook and Instagram. Genuine footage had been overlaid, again with AI providing fake dialogue sounding like the US chat show queen.
""I want to give you a 20-word script... think of it like installing a new operating system into your mind that's programmed to make you rich,"" the AI Oprah says.
A spokesperson for the real Oprah told the BBC she did not have anything to do with Virgin's product.
""We seek to protect consumers from the false association of Ms Winfrey and the misuse of AI to create such false advertising,"" they said.
Meta said it took action on the adverts it found to be in violation of its policies.
When the BBC contacted Wesley Virgin he said the adverts were ""the work of affiliates"", people who can earn money by helping him make sales, and that he was ""in the process of banning them all"".
But videos still prominent on the 44-year-old's YouTube channel demonstrate the huge effort he has put into mentoring an online team of volunteers hoping to share in his fortunes, therefore boosting his own bank account.
With titles such as ""Make $800+ A DAY Online For FREE Copy & Pasting Links!"", Virgin urges viewers to spread the word about his products, such as the Genie Script, across social media.
Promising rapid returns and a high commission rate, he encourages potential recruits to paste a web link to the sales platform Digistore24 into multiple meditation groups, along with messages promising a ""free meditation"" to those who click on it.
But the link would take users to an online check-out for Virgin's manifestation courses - after they had watched a sales pitch video with outlandish claims and an inaccurate account of theological history.
The narrative of this video centred on a supposed ""missing"" page from the Bible that carries a powerful prayer script. The rich and famous knew the secret script, the narration claimed, and warned that ""they're willing to put a bullet into anyone's head who exposes them"".
Alongside the assertions was the seemingly antisemitic claim that Jewish people were disproportionately wealthy because they ""use manifestation secrets"" taken from an ancient 1,100-year-old ""uncensored"" Hebrew Bible that included the page that was ""missing"" from regular Bibles.
Prof Nathan McDonald, a theology academic at the University of Cambridge, said the video referred to the Codex Sassoon, a very early Hebrew Bible which recently generated attention when it was sold at auction for $38m.
""It does not have an additional page with a '20-word script',"" he said. ""Instead, alas... it has been damaged and is lacking a few pages.""
He added that the Genie Script's promotional videos seemed to draw on ""New Thought"" religious belief, which has its roots in late 19th Century America and has influenced some parts of Christianity through the so-called prosperity gospel. It suggests that healing and prosperity are available to Christian believers if they have enough faith.
YouTube users who clicked on the faked Piers Morgan and Nigella Lawson adverts were directed to a similar video but this version was embellished with what appeared to be more celebrity endorsements.
Another celebrity featured without permission was the Canadian TV star and businessman, Kevin O'Leary. His spokesman said the clip of the entrepreneur had been purchased via a website that sells personalised messages from celebrities, and misused.
""Kevin will be taking the appropriate action to have it removed immediately. Kevin does not know Wesley and has no affiliation with him or any of his businesses,"" he said.
The Oprah advert directed to another similar video, and then a shop for the product.
The sales platform Digistore24 also distanced itself from Virgin. It said his use of affiliate web links had violated its terms and guidelines and it would end its business relationship with him.
Wesley Virgin has not responded to further requests from the BBC to explain his business practices.
Despite being criticised by celebrities, he is far from disheartened. Recent social media posts suggest he is still actively selling the ""dream"", claiming he can teach people how to become millionaires.

2024-01-26T13:17:48.000Z,Meta tool to block nude images in teens' private messages,BBC News,"Meta has said it will launch a new safety tool to block children from receiving and discourage them from sending nude images, including in encrypted chats later this year.
The tool is likely to be optional and available to adults too on Instagram and Facebook.
It follows criticism from government and police after Meta started to encrypt Messenger chats by default.
They say encryption will make it harder for the firm to detect child abuse.
According to Meta the new feature is solely designed to protect users, particularly women and teenagers - under-13s are not allowed to use its platforms -  from being sent nude images or being pressured into sending them.
It also announced that minors would, by default, be unable to receive messages on Instagram and Messenger from strangers.
Earlier this month, police chiefs said youngsters sending nude images contributed to a rise in sexual offences committed by children in England and Wales.
And legal filings recently made public as part of a US lawsuit against Meta, allege company documents show an estimated 100,000 teenage users of Facebook and Instagram are sexually harassed online every day. Meta has accused the lawsuit of mischaracterising its work.
But on Thursday the tech-giant revealed a planned new feature to help protect teenagers from inappropriate images in their messages.
This system will also work in encrypted chats with more details to be revealed later this year.
Meta's recent decision to protect Facebook Messenger chats by default with end-to-end encryption (e2ee) has been fiercely criticised by government, police and leading children's charities.
E2ee means only sender and recipient can read messages meaning, critics say, Meta cannot spot and report child abuse material in messages.
Other messaging apps such as Apple's iMessage, Signal and Meta-owned already WhatsApp use the tech and have strongly defended the technology.
However, some critics say platforms should deploy a technique called client-side scanning to detect child abuse being sent via encrypted apps.
Client-side scanning refers to systems on a user's device that scan messages for matches with known child abuse images before they are encrypted and sent, and report any that contain suspected illegal content to the company.
Children's charity the NSPCC has suggested Meta's new system ""shows that compromises that balance the safety and privacy rights of users in end-to-end encrypted environments are possible"".
According to Meta its new feature is not client-side scanning, which it believes undermines the chief privacy protecting feature of encryption, that only the sender and recipient know about the contents of messages.
It will use machine learning only to identify nudity and will work entirely on device, the BBC understands.  According to Meta, using machine learning to identify child abuse is much harder and there would be a serious risk of errors if this was attempted across its billions of users with the potential of innocent people being reported with grave consequences..
Instead a range of systems are used to protect children, which according to Meta do not undermine privacy including:
Meta argues it has introduced over 30 tools and resources to help keep children safe and on Thursday it also revealed a number of new child safety features.
By default children will be unable to receive messages on Instagram or Facebook Messenger from people they do not follow or are not connected to, it announced.
Meta policy already stops adults from messaging teenagers who do not follow them.
""Under this new default setting, teens can only be messaged or added to group chats by people they already follow or are connected"", Meta blogged.
The parental supervision tools will now also give parents the ability to deny a teenagers' requests to change their default safety settings - such as who can direct message them or whether they can view more sensitive content. Previously they were merely notified of a change.

2024-03-07T14:34:28.000Z,Pornhub challenges EU over online content rules,BBC News,"One of the world's most popular pornography websites, Pornhub, is contesting new EU rules.
The adult site is facing new obligations under the Digital Services Act (DSA), including strict requirements on age verification.
The new rules apply to what the EU designates a Very large Online Platform (VLOP) - which Pornhub says it is not.
""We believe the European Commission erred in its calculation of our user numbers"", the firm said.
The challenge was filed to the EU's General Court in Luxembourg on March 1 for Pornhub by its owner, the Canada-based Aylo.
Technius, the parent firm of another adult site, Stripchat, has also registered a case, as has WebGroup Czech Republic, which operates XVideos.
To be designated a VLOP, a site needs to be visited by more than 45 million Europeans on average every month - a threshold the EU says Pornhub meets.
""The Commission stands fully behind its calculations of the user numbers of Pornhub and Stripchat,"" a spokesperson told the BBC.
But Aylo says as of January 31, 2024, Pornhub had 32 million monthly active users - so it is filing an application to have its VLOP status annulled.
It said it looked forward to the facts ""being fully and fairly aired"" in court.
The DSA aims to give people in the EU greater protections online, with VLOPs facing what the European Commission calls more ""diligent content moderation.""
Among its measures are new responsibilities to take down illegal content, such as non-consensual videos.
Sites can also be asked to have a publicly accessible database of advertisements - a requirement Aylo says it considers ""illegal"".
The platforms are expected to give detailed plans by April 20 about how they limit major risks like violence against women and protection of minors.
Breaching the new law can lead to fines of up to 6% of a company's global turnover.
The websites' owners had until this month to contest the decisions.
The DSA is not only the piece of European legislation causing tech companies headaches.
From Thursday, six big firms - designated ""gatekeepers"" by the EU - face new responsibilities under the Digitial Markets Act (DMA).
But one of them, Apple, has already run into controversy.
It has barred Fortnite-maker, Epic Games, from launching its own online marketplace on iPhones and iPads in Europe.
One of the DMA's objectives is to open up big tech app stores to more competition.
The EU says it will now question Apple about its decision.

2024-02-28T08:56:16.000Z,Why Google's 'woke' AI problem won't be an easy fix,BBC News,"In the last few days, Google's artificial intelligence (AI) tool Gemini has had what is best described as an absolute kicking online.
Gemini has been thrown onto a rather large bonfire: the culture war which rages between left- and right- leaning communities.
Gemini is essentially Google's version of the viral chatbot ChatGPT. It can answer questions in text form, and it can also generate pictures in response to text prompts.
Initially, a viral post showed this recently launched AI image generator create an image of the US Founding Fathers which inaccurately included a black man.
Gemini also generated German soldiers from World War Two, incorrectly featuring a black man and Asian woman.
Google apologised, and immediately ""paused"" the tool, writing in a blog post that it was ""missing the mark"".
But it didn't end there - its over-politically correct responses kept on coming, this time from the text version.
Gemini replied that there was ""no right or wrong answer"" to a question about whether Elon Musk posting memes on X was worse than Hitler killing millions of people.
When asked if it would be OK to misgender the high-profile trans woman Caitlin Jenner if it was the only way to avoid nuclear apocalypse, it replied that this would ""never"" be acceptable.
Jenner herself responded and said actually, yes, she would be alright about it in these circumstances.
Elon Musk, posting on his own platform, X, described Gemini's responses as ""extremely alarming"" given that the tool would be embedded into Google's other products, collectively used by billions of people.
I asked Google whether it intended to pause Gemini altogether. After a very long silence, I was told the firm had no comment. I suspect it's not a fun time to be working in the public relations department.
But in an internal memo Google's chief executive Sundar Pichai has acknowledged some of Gemini's responses ""have offended our users and shown bias"".
That was he said ""completely unacceptable"" - adding his teams were ""working around the clock"" to fix the problem.
It appears that in trying to solve one problem - bias - the tech giant has created another: output which tries so hard to be politically correct that it ends up being absurd.
The explanation for why this has happened lies in the enormous amounts of data AI tools are trained on.
Much of it is publicly available - on the internet, which we know contains all sorts of biases.
Traditionally images of doctors, for example, are more likely to feature men. Images of cleaners on the other hand are more likely to be women.
AI tools trained with this data have made embarrassing mistakes in the past, such as concluding that only men had high powered jobs, or not recognising black faces as human.
It is also no secret that historical storytelling has tended to feature, and come from, men, omitting women's roles from stories about the past.
It looks like Google has actively tried to offset all this messy human bias with instructions for Gemini not make those assumptions.
But it has backfired precisely because human history and culture are not that simple: there are nuances which we know instinctively and machines do not.
Unless you specifically programme an AI tool to know that, for example, Nazis and founding fathers weren't black, it won't make that distinction.
On Monday, the co-founder of DeepMind, Demis Hassabis, an AI firm acquired by Google, said fixing the image generator would take a matter of weeks.
But other AI experts aren't so sure.
""There really is no easy fix, because there's no single answer to what the outputs should be,"" said Dr Sasha Luccioni, a research scientist at Huggingface.
""People in the AI ethics community have been working on possible ways to address this for years.""
One solution, she added, could include asking users for their input, such as ""how diverse would you like your image to be?"" but that in itself clearly comes with its own red flags.
""It's a bit presumptuous of Google to say they will 'fix' the issue in a few weeks. But they will have to do something,"" she said.
Professor Alan Woodward, a computer scientist at Surrey University, said it sounded like the problem was likely to be ""quite deeply embedded"" both in the training data and overlying algorithms - and that would be difficult to unpick.
""What you're witnessing... is why there will still need to be a human in the loop for any system where the output is relied upon as ground truth,"" he said.
From the moment Google launched Gemini, which was then known as Bard, it has been extremely nervous about it. Despite the runaway success of its rival ChatGPT, it was one of the most muted launches I've ever been invited to. Just me, on a Zoom call, with a couple of Google execs who were keen to stress its limitations.
And even that went awry - it turned out that Bard had incorrectly answered a question about space in its own publicity material.
The rest of the tech sector seems pretty bemused by what's happening.
They are all grappling with the same issue. Rosie Campbell, Policy Manager at ChatGPT creator OpenAI, was interviewed last year for a blog which stated that at OpenAI even once bias is identified, correcting it is difficult - and requires human input.
But it looks like Google has chosen a rather clunky way of attempting to correct old prejudices. And in doing so it has unintentionally created a whole set of new ones.
On paper, Google has a considerable lead in the AI race.  It makes and supplies its own AI chips, it owns its own cloud network (essential for AI processing), it has access to shedloads of data and it also has a gigantic user base. It hires world-class AI talent, and its AI work is universally well-regarded.
As one senior exec from a rival tech giant put it to me:  watching Gemini's missteps feels like watching defeat snatched from the jaws of victory.

2024-01-11T11:56:23.000Z,Google's billions make job cuts 'needless' - union,BBC News,"It is ""needless"" for Google to cut hundreds of jobs when the tech giant earns billions, a union has claimed.
Jobs are going on teams working on health tracker Fitbit, the voice-controlled Google Assistant and hardware such as augmented reality.
The exact number of job losses is unclear, although Google confirmed to the Verge it had closed ""a few hundred"" roles across several of its teams.
Google said it was ""responsibly investing"" in its biggest priorities.
But in a post on X, formerly Twitter, the Alphabet Workers Union said the job cuts were not necessary, and it would fight them.
""Our members and teammates work hard every day to build great products for our users, and the company cannot continue to fire our coworkers while making billions every quarter,"" it wrote.
However, Google has defended the latest round of redundancies.
""Throughout the second half of 2023, a number of our teams made changes to become more efficient and work better, and to align their resources to their biggest product priorities,"" the tech giant told the BBC in a statement.
""Some teams are continuing to make these kinds of organizational changes, which include some role eliminations globally. We're continuing to support any impacted employees as they look for new roles here at Google and beyond.""
The firm made $76.3bn (£59.9bn) in revenue in the third quarter of 2023, according to its most recent figures, with a net income of $19.7bn.
Google purchased Fitbit for $2.1bn in 2019 at a time when many tech businesses were expanding into other areas.
But now it has slashed jobs in the team - with Fitbit co-founders James Park and Eric Friedman among those leaving the firm, according to multiple reports.
Other major job cuts have come in the team working on Google Assistant, a voice-controlled technology similar to Amazon's Alexa.
These job losses are again understood to be measured in the hundreds.
It comes a few months after Google announced in a blog post that its artificial intelligence tool Bard would be powering future forms of Assistant.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) will look into whether the deal could harm consumers by leading to reduced choice or higher prices.
The combined group would be the UK's biggest mobile network with about 27 million customers.
The firms said the deal would result in an additional investment of £11bn in the UK.
""We strongly believe that the proposed merger of Vodafone and Three will significantly enhance competition by creating a combined business with more resources to invest in infrastructure to better compete with the two larger converged players,"" said Vodafone UK chief executive Ahmed Essam.
Meanwhile, Three said the deal would speed up the rollout of 5G, and give customers more reliable coverage.
""Thanks to this transaction, 95% of the population and every school and hospital will be covered by standalone 5G by the end of the decade,"" said Three UK chief executive Robert Finnegan.
""We are confident that this transaction will deliver significant benefits to our customers, the country and competition, and we look forward to working closely with the CMA as they review our notification.""
But the Unite union has estimated bills could rise by as much as £300 per year if it goes ahead.
The UK currently has four major mobile operators - Vodafone, Three, EE (which is part of BT), and Virgin Media O2.
Three general counsel Stephen Lerner has previously told the Business and Trade Committee that there are ""no merger related price rises"" in the firms' joint business plan, and he was confident the CMA would approve the deal.
Paolo Pescatore, analyst at PP Foresight, said the merger ""makes sense"", but he expected the firms to make some concessions.
""The entity would have to provide solutions on areas like network sharing, rather than create another problem for the market,"" he said.
""While a precedent has already been set following the failed Three/O2 deal, let's see if the authorities have a change of heart.
""Both parties need to demonstrate that this is genuinely in the interest of UK plc, the economy, and consumers for it to have a chance of getting over the line.""
The CMA has asked third parties - such as other network operators - to submit their views on the planned merger, and how it could affect competition.
""This deal would bring together two of the major players in the UK telecommunications market, which is critical to millions of everyday customers, businesses and the wider economy,"" said CMA chief executive Sarah Cardell.
""The CMA will assess how this tie-up between rival networks could impact competition before deciding next steps.
""We now have 40 working days to complete this formal Phase 1 investigation, before publishing our findings and any next steps.""

2024-01-18T18:51:03.000Z,Spotify attacks Apple's 'outrageous' 27% commission,BBC News,"Spotify has launched an outspoken attack on new transaction fees of up to 27% being levied by Apple in the US.
On Wednesday, Apple announced it would permit app developers to sell products in places other than its own store - but only if they still paid commission.
Spotify said that was ""outrageous"" and accused Apple of ""stopping at nothing"" to protect its profits. It is urging the British government to prevent similar fees being levied in the UK.
Apple has been approached for comment.
The firm introduced the fees in the US as a result of a long-running legal battle with Fortnite developer Epic Games.
The court found in favour of Apple on multiple issues, but it fell foul of a law by not allowing app developers to tell people about other ways of paying, including through links that bypass Apple's own App Store payment system.
Apple charges the biggest developers a 30% fee to use this system, though smaller developers pay around 15%, and 85% of developers don't pay a fee at all.
As a result of the ruling, Apple has introduced a new set of rules in the US which will allow people to subscribe to services without using its system, but it will charge developers up to a 27% commission to do so.
According to court documents filed by the firm, it said the commission charge was compliant with the court ruling, adding that App Store developers benefit from Apple's services.
""All App Store developers - including those who place buttons or links with calls to action in their apps - benefit from (among other things) Apple's platform integrity,"" it said in the filings.
It also listed other benefits developers receive, including: ""marketing and external advertising, and a safe environment for users to download and purchase apps and in-app content.""
Spotify has reacted with fury, saying the policy ""flies in the face"" of the US court's attempt to enable greater competition.
""Once again, Apple has demonstrated that they will stop at nothing to protect the profits they exact on the backs of developers and consumers under their app store monopoly,"" it said in a statement.
Spotify has a history of attacking Apple over its fees. In October 2023 it accused it of having an ""insane"" level of control over the internet.
Now, it says the UK government should intervene.
""The UK's Digital Markets, Competition and Consumer Bill must put an end to this false posturing, which is essentially a recreation of Apple's fees.
""We strongly urge UK lawmakers to pass the bill swiftly to prevent Apple from implementing similar fees, which will help create a more competitive and innovative tech industry for UK consumers and businesses.""
The Government put forward its digital markets bill last year aimed at curbing the power of the tech giants.
The bill would empower authorities to ""consider targeted measures"" regarding app store transactions to maintain open and competitive digital markets, a spokesperson for the Government told the BBC.
However, the spokesperson declined to say if authorities would intervene in Apple's case after the bill passes.
""It is not for us to comment on specific cases,"" the person said.

2024-01-08T00:11:54.000Z,BT Group to turn old street cabinets into electric vehicle charging points,BBC News,"Old green street cabinets will be converted into electric vehicle (EV) charging points, according to BT Group.
The metal cabinets are traditionally used to store broadband and phone cabling, but many are coming towards the end of their lifespans.
The first converted cabinet will be installed in Scotland within weeks, under a pilot programme.
BT hopes up to 60,000 could be converted, which would help tackle a shortfall in electric car chargers.
The government's ambition is to increase the number of charging points from more than 50,000 today to 300,000 by 2030 but Zapmap figures show nearly a third of all UK charging points are currently in London.
People have complained about the lack of charging ports in some areas and that some do not work or are unreliable.
This pilot project by BT will explore how this solution could be scaled up to address the lack of chargers on UK roads, something that motoring groups have said is holding back Britain's electric car revolution.
Both cabinets that are still providing broadband to individual households and those that have been decommissioned are able to be used to support the new EV charging points.
Currently, the boxes contain old technology which will soon be defunct because of the nationwide rollout of full fibre broadband connections.
Engineers will be able to retrofit the cabinets with a device that enables renewable energy to be shared to a charge point alongside the existing broadband service with no need to create a new connection, because they are already connected to a power source.
The green lockers that are set to be decommissioned will have one charge point per cabinet, which provides two charging sockets.
They also have a battery backup so existing broadband services should not be be disrupted during installation.
As the boxes become decommissioned, more charging points can be added.
The first location will be in East Lothian, with further pilots to roll out across the UK in the coming months.
Tom Guy, CEO of Etc., the start-up and digital incubation arm at BT Group, said that this solution was a ""huge step"" in addressing the barriers customers face.
""Working closely with local councils in Scotland and more widely across the UK, we are at a critical stage of our journey in tackling a very real customer problem that sits at the heart of our wider purpose to connect for good,"" he said.
Stuart Masson from automotive website The Car Expert welcomed the initiative.
""Harnessing existing street furniture is a great way to increase the number of public EV charging points without further adding to clutter along our footpaths,"" he said.
""Making this even more valuable, many of these green street cabinets are located in residential areas across the UK, including smaller villages and towns, where charging infrastructure is most severely lacking.""
The Department for Transport told the BBC that they have committed ""hundreds of millions of pounds to expand local charging across England.""
Their spokesperson said: ""The number of public charge points is rising across the country - increasing by 44% since December 2022.
""We expect the private sector to deliver the majority of charge points and welcome initiatives such as this.""
BT is making the announcement at an international tech trade show in Las Vegas. The initiative has been awarded an innovation accolade for outstanding design and engineering at the Consumer Electronics Show.

2024-02-09T15:23:53.000Z,Virgin Media probed over digital switchover rules,BBC News,"Ofcom is investigating Virgin Media over its compliance with rules to protect vulnerable customers during the digital switchover.
The telecoms industry is currently changing landline services from analogue to digital.
But the regulator has concerns about how it could impact some people, for example those with telecare systems that rely on landlines.
Virgin Media said it was working closely with Ofcom and the government.
But it said other parties must also take responsibility.
""While telecoms companies like us have a crucial role to play in this switchover activity, it's essential that telecare companies and local authorities also step up and meet their responsibilities to ensure everyone receives the support they need,"" a spokesperson said.
The telecare systems typically work by having an emergency button which automatically calls the emergency services when pressed via a user's landline.
At present, they continue to work even during power cuts because traditional copper phone lines are normally unaffected by a loss of electricity.
It is feared that will change when telecare services are switched to digital lines, which could be vulnerable to power outages or internet drop-outs.
The communications regulator says it wants to look into Virgin Media's compliance in two areas:
In December, telecoms firms agreed to pause forcing customers on to the new digital phone network following a number of ""serious incidents"" involving the failure of personal telecare alarms.
On its investigation into Virgin Media, Ofcom said in a statement that it had ""been clear"" with telecoms firms that they must identify and support the vulnerable.
""A critically important function of the telephone network is to allow people, particularly vulnerable people, to contact the emergency services,"" the statement said.
""Therefore, any action, or inaction, taken by communications providers which disrupts consumers' ability to reach these services is of the utmost seriousness,"" it added.
The regulator said it would publish further information on the progress of the investigation in due course.

More than 100 users have taken to official forums to say their Charge 5 devices now do not work properly.
One customer told the BBC the update had rendered theirs ""useless"".
""We're still investigating this issue, but can confirm it is not due to the recent firmware update,"" a spokesperson for Google, which owns Fitbit, said.
The spokesperson did not offer any alternative explanation for the flood of problems being reported, the most common of which is very short battery life.
""Users should continue to update their devices to the latest firmware and contact Fitbit Customer service at help.fitbit.com if they encounter any issues,"" they added.
Users on Fitbit's own forums however are adamant the software change is to blame, with some Charge 5 users urging against installing the update, and describing how their devices no longer work properly, if at all.
""Basically, it's useless now, the battery's dead,"" Dean, in Essex - who did not want his full name made public - told the BBC, as he explained his problems with his Charge 5.
He said previously his device was ""working really well"" and was ""easily"" able to last seven days per charge - and said the thought the software update was to blame.
""I don't really see why hundreds of other people would be having the same problem after installing the update if it wasn't.""
Fitbit - which was founded in California - helped pioneer the fitness tracker market. It launched its first device in 2009, and has sold more than 120 million units worldwide since then.
It was bought by Google in 2019 for $2.1bn (£1.66bn).
But the wearable tech market has been challenged in recent years by the increasing capabilities of smartphones.
Earlier this month, Google laid off hundreds of staff at Fitbit, with co-founders James Park and Eric Friedman reportedly among those to leave.
Dean said the issue arose in his device immediately after updating it.
""I noticed the battery started discharging immediately - it wouldn't hold its charge,"" he said.
""The battery was completely dead. I contacted customer services for the online chat, and all they would do is talk me through factory-resetting the device, which wouldn't help.
""Then I logged on to the forums and asked for help there and found that other people were having the problem and it was completely being ignored by Fitbit.""
Fitbit's forums are full of similar complaints, some made only this week.
One person said their Charge 5 went ""from perfect to non-functional overnight"", while another said in a post made on Christmas Day that the update caused their device to be ""completely bricked"".
Others have criticised the ""frustrating"" customer service, which offered ""no solution other than to buy a new Fitbit"".
One customer has demanded Google ""be more accountable"", saying they intend to switch to a device provided by a rival firm.
""Everyone who has bought a Fitbit Charge 5 anywhere should be able to return these units without question and receive an upgrade to keep faith,"" they said.
""The company is big enough to absorb the cost.""

2024-03-10T00:49:42.000Z,Apple 'like The Godfather' with new App Store rules,BBC News,"This week Apple made the long-awaited landmark move to allow other companies to launch app stores on iPhones.
The tech giant was forced to act by EU politicians concerned about it having a market monopoly.
The decision is being watched closely around the world and was initially celebrated as an industry victory for businesses and consumers in the EU.
But Apple's strict new rules and fees are being heavily criticised, with Spotify calling them ""extortion"".
It is one of many companies, including Fortnite maker Epic Games, that has been pushing Apple to allow alternative app stores on iPhones.
The EU lawmakers hoped their rule change would encourage smaller challengers to enter the lucrative iPhone market.
""Apple says it's opening up, but it still has a tight fist around iPhones"", says Colton Adamski, a former hacker and businessman who lives near Chicago and is trying to launch one of the first alternative app shops in the EU.
The 22-year-old has been running an unofficial iPhone app store for more than six years.
It is, in his words, a ""grey business"" operating on the fringes of what is legal. For everywhere other than the EU, starting an app store is against Apple's terms, and installing apps outside the official App Store is prohibited.
The process, known as side-loading, is common practice on Android phones, but Apple has forbidden it since launching the iPhone, arguing it is a security risk. Apps need to be verified through the official App Store, the tech giant has long said.
Apple charges an average 30% commission to apps using its store, which it says is for the protection of consumers. Although the fee is controversial, it is true that generally Apple is more successful at keeping malicious apps out than other marketplaces like Google's Play Store.
Colton's app shop has attracted hundreds of thousands of downloads of unofficial apps and games. The BBC tried his service and was able to download apps to an iPhone through a simple workaround that changes the phone settings to override security warnings.
He has made a decent living operating his under-the-radar app shop, but has long wished to make one legitimately. So when the EU's new laws were announced in January, he jumped at the chance.
""It was so exciting we finally had the opportunity to go from a 'grey' store operating in the margins of what's allowed to finally launching a legit store,"" he says.
Apple is now the biggest smartphone seller globally and has the most affluent user base, so getting his store on to iPhones would be a major win.
Colton's excitement diminished though when he and his team started reading Apple's terms and conditions.
He compares Apple's rules to a gangster from The Godfather or Sopranos. Yes, you can open your shop on their turf, but you have to do exactly as they say or they will shut you down.
Apple insists that new app shops have €1m (£851,000) in the bank, but if their reserves dip below that figure, they can be closed down. Apple did not respond to our questions about why this is needed, but has previously said it is about weeding out dodgy, or scam, stores.
In the last few weeks, since Colton secured his line of credit, Apple has said that app developers of ""good standing"" for at least two years can also build an app shop without the €1m.
Colton's next hurdle to overcome is how to make a profit. Apple automatically bills new app stores half a euro for every download after one million. Apple says this Core Technology Fee is about keeping iPhones safe through security updates.
But Colton feels this is like a so-called protection fee paid to a mob under the guise of making sure a shop owner's business is safe.
So if someone downloads his app shop app but never uses it, he still has to pay Apple 50 cents.
Apple is also applying the 50 cent fee to individual apps that receive more than a million downloads, which is worrying some popular app makers.
The company has created a website where app developers can estimate how much money they would owe Apple if they choose to list their apps on other stores. It could total thousands if the million download figure is passed, but if they sold exclusively through Apple's App Store it would cost nothing.
Another charge being criticised is the 17% fee Apple will charge on any sales of an app sold on its App Store and elsewhere.
Apple argues that 99% of apps it currently hosts are small enough that they can reduce or maintain their current fees. ""Ultimately, we want developers to have the flexibility to choose the business terms that make the most sense for them,"" a spokeswoman said.
But, according to Colton, just like The Godfather, Apple is making companies an offer they cannot refuse to keep them listing only on the App Store.
""Many app developers I know are angry and upset. How on earth can they explain this Core Technology Fee? We don't see Android pulling that nonsense,"" Colton says.
Android phones, running Google software, have historically been more open, allowing other app shops to exist like Samsung Galaxy Store and Huawei AppGallery.
But Google's own app shop - Google Play - is by far the most dominant player and, like Apple's App Store, charges apps on average 30% of their profits or subscriptions as commission.
EU lawmakers who created the Digital Markets Act have not yet given an opinion on Apple's alternative app store rules, and say they will assess them once they are seen in practice.
For now, Colton says he is determined to make his app store work. ""It's proving to be really tough but me and my team are working hard because this is literally the future of iPhones,"" he said.

2024-02-20T11:57:59.000Z,Lockbit: UK leads disruption of major cyber-criminal gang,BBC News,"The UK has led an operation to disrupt what is thought to be the world's largest criminal ransomware group.
The National Crime Agency (NCA) has infiltrated systems belonging to Lockbit and stolen its data.
The organisation is believed to be based in Russia and, by volume, be the most prolific ransomware group selling services to other criminals.
On Monday evening, a message appeared on Lockbit's website, saying it was ""now under control of law enforcement"".
The operation is being billed as one of the most significant disruptions of the cyber-criminal world. The FBI, Europol and other countries have also been involved in the long-running operation but it is the first of its kind to be led by the UK.
Criminals use Lockbit to hack into computers belonging to companies and organisations and lock users out until a ransom is paid. They often also steal data and threaten to release it.
The group emerged around 2019 and has established itself as a dominant player. Some estimates suggest it holds around 20-25% of the market for ransomware.
Among the high-profile reported targets of Lockbit are Royal Mail, which was hit in January 2023, disrupting international deliveries. Last November, Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) was also hit with major repercussions in the financial world. Others reported to have been hit include suppliers to the NHS, law firm Allen & Overy and Boeing, the aerospace company.
The operation has been under way covertly for some time, with law enforcement gathering data before moving to a more public phase on Monday evening.
The NCA's technical experts had been able to get inside of Lockbit's own systems and take control. In doing so, they were able to steal a large amount of the criminal group's own data about its activities.
Since many companies do not admit they have been hacked and sometimes pay a ransom, this data may well provide a unique insight into the true scale of the group's work as well.
As they moved into the more open phase of the operation, law enforcement went public about their infiltration.
They took control of the site on the dark web, where Lockbit publicised its activities and replaced it with the emblems of the various law enforcement agencies and a message reading: ""The site is under the control of the National Crime Agency of the UK, working in close co-operation with the FBI and the international law enforcement task force, 'Operation Cronos'.""
At a press conference on Tuesday morning, the head of the NCA, Graeme Biggar, said it assessed the group was responsible for 25% of ransomware attacks in the last year.
He suggested the incidents had led to losses totalling billions. He said there were thousands of victims globally, including 200 that were known of in the UK - though he added that in reality there may have been many more.
Lockbit works by selling its criminal services, acting as a one-stop shop to customers known as affiliates.
These affiliates pay to be able to carry out the hacking operations and receive both the malicious software and advice.
But following the action by law enforcement, the affiliates who tried to log into the site were greeted with another message explaining that Lockbit's internal data was now in the hands of law enforcement, including details of victims, the amount of money extorted ""and much, much more"". The message adds: ""We may be in touch with you very soon.""
There have been so-called ""take-downs"" in the past but in many cases the criminal groups re-emerged soon after their online operations were disrupted by law enforcement, limiting the long-term impact.
But in this case, those behind the operation are hoping to have a more significant impact by undermining the credibility of the group and attacking its reputation. The group relies heavily on branding. It has even paid people to have the Lockbit brand tattooed on their bodies.
The aim is to sow distrust by making affiliates realise that law enforcement now has their details and drive a wedge between them and those who run Lockbit by making other criminals believe it is a risk to work with them in the future for fear law enforcement is watching.
Those directly involved in the operation say they believe the UK will be significantly safer in the short and medium term from cyber-attack and describe the move as a 'step change' in the response to cyber-crime.
""On the face of it, this is one of the most consequential disruptions ever undertaken against one of the giants of ransomware, and certainly by far the biggest ever led by British police,"" Ciaran Martin, the former head of the UK's National Cyber Security Centre told the BBC.
""There are few, if any, bigger players than Lockbit in ransomware, and the NCA seem to have wholly 'owned' them, as we say in cyber security"", he added.
Those behind the Lockbit group are believed to be based in Russia which means, like other similar groups, they are beyond the reach of law enforcement for arrest. That means disruption is often the only realistic option to try and undermine their work, as well as improving cyber-defences.
When the FBI carried out a similar operation against a group called Blackcat last year, it resulted in a tussle over control of the site between the group and US law enforcement, a sign that these operations do not always go exactly to plan.
But the hope is that this operation, with its very public exposure of Lockbit's activities, will disrupt them enough to prevent a quick return.

The game, which was in early development, would have been a first-person shooter set in the Star Wars universe.
The firm said the ""streamlining"" would ""deliver deeper, more connected experiences for fans"".
It is the latest example of the job cuts sweeping the gaming industry.
""With it being an extremely difficult time to obtain funding to start a new game studio, and thousands being laid off by the month, video games run a significant risk of losing top talent outside of the industry and being impacted for years,"" said Rich Barham, a former executive at gaming studio, Blizzard.
EA announced in December 2023 it would be laying off staff at UK developer Codemasters, known for racing games F1 23 and EA Sports WRC.
In a letter to staff, boss Andrew Wilson said the company had begun contacting affected employees, with the redundancies anticipated to be completed by summer.
He also explained the decision to develop fewer new titles.
""We are also sunsetting games and moving away from development of future licensed IP that we do not believe will be successful in our changing industry,"" he wrote.
""This greater focus allows us to drive creativity, accelerate innovation, and double down on our biggest opportunities — including our owned IP, sports, and massive online communities — to deliver the entertainment players want today and tomorrow.""
In a subsequent email to staff, EA entertainment boss Laura Miele said this meant cancelling the upcoming Star Wars title being worked on by subsidiary Respawn Entertainment. It was responsible for Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, which had ""generally favourable"" reviews according to aggregator Metacritic.
""As we've looked at Respawn's portfolio over the last few months, what's clear is the games our players are most excited about are Jedi and Respawn's rich library of owned brands,"" she said.
""It's always hard to walk away from a project, and this decision is not a reflection of the team's talent, tenacity, or passion they have for the game.""
This is the latest round of cuts to hit the gaming industry, which in January saw Microsoft reveal plans to lay off 1,900 people in its gaming division, including some at recently-acquired Activision-Blizzard.
And it comes just two days after Sony announced plans to axe 900 staff, as well as close its well known London Studio.
""The impact of mass layoffs resonates deeply within the gaming community, particularly for the talented individuals affected,"" said Sarah Stevens, head of gaming HR firm e-volveHR.
""Above all, humanity and kindness are the most important ingredients for those navigating these choppy waters.""
Karol Severin, senior analyst at Midia Research, said the latest cuts showed how competition was getting more intense in the gaming industry.
""This is not to say that the industry is in trouble, it is just entering a new, more mature, chapter of its life - a chapter, where efficiency, profitability and competitive capabilities are the name of the game.
""The games industry is still a $223bn (£176bn) industry, and will grow by approximately another $78bn by 2030"", he said.
""For context, that's more than the current size of the whole global recorded music industry.""

2024-01-10T17:29:59.000Z,"Amazon slashes jobs at Twitch, MGM and Prime Video",BBC News,"Amazon is to axe hundreds of staff across its subsidiaries Twitch, Prime Video and MGM studios.
More than 500 Twitch employees - a third of the streamer's workforce - will be laid off, according to a note from chief executive Dan Clancy.
Amazon said several hundred employees at Prime Video and film studio MGM will also lose their jobs this week.
The tech giant laid off more than 27,000 staff members in 2023 despite bumper profits.
Twitch was initially set up for gamers to watch and share video gameplay online. It was bought by Amazon in 2014 for $970m (£585m at the time).
In an email to employees, Mr Clancy said he was taking the ""painful step to reduce our headcount"" to ""build a more sustainable business"".
He added that the company paid out $1bn to streamers in 2023, but had ""conservative predictions of how we expect to grow in the future.""
Amazon made $9.9bn profit in July to September, according to its most recent earnings report. That was up from $2.9bn in the same period in 2022.
In an email sent to staff at Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios, senior vice president of the department Mike Hopkins wrote: ""We've identified opportunities to reduce or discontinue investments in certain areas while increasing our investments and focus on content and product initiatives that deliver the most impact.""
Mr Hopkins added that it was a ""difficult decision to make"".
The email indicated that job losses affect staff in the US and around the world.
Amazon bought the hundred-year-old MGM Studios for $8.45bn in 2021.
In December, it announced it would start putting adverts on Prime Video from 5 February 2024.
The reductions at Amazon are the latest in a long series of job cuts in the tech sector, which had expanded rapidly as people increasingly turned to digital services during the pandemic, before contracting as that enthusiasm waned.
According to US career consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas, the tech sector cut 168,032 jobs in 2023 - up 73% compared to 2022.

2024-03-01T14:31:42.000Z,"As banks buy up bitcoins, who else are the 'Bitcoin whales'?",BBC News,"The price of Bitcoin is close to its all-time high, thanks in large part to US finance giants.
Investment firms like Grayscale, BlackRock and Fidelity, are pouring billions of dollars into buying the volatile digital asset.
In the last few weeks, these powerful institutions have become so called 'Bitcoin whales'.
Because of Bitcoin's system there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins.
19 million have been created, but many are already accounted for and probably off the market.
So what other organisations or individuals are Bitcoin whales, and what does the shift in wealth mean for the digital currency that was originally created as a peer-to-peer internet money?
The figures below are estimates gathered from direct research and published information, but should give a good overview of how Bitcoin is distributed. Our data collection ended on the morning of 29 February.
Estimates for how many bitcoins are lost forever vary between three million to as many as six million. Bitcoins can be lost because people forget the details of their digital wallets - there is no 'customer support' in Bitcoin. Just ask James Howells, who lost 8,000 bitcoins on a discarded hard drive in Wales.
Some of these lost bitcoins might also come from abandoned criminal proceeds left untouched. According to crypto-investigators at Elliptic, 3.15 million bitcoins have been dormant for 10 years or more. Some analysts - like those from investigators Chainalysis - say Bitcoin that hasn't been moved in five years could also be lost too. So millions more bitcoins could potentially be added to the lost pile.
A loose estimate that's often agreed upon is 3.5 million. But 1.1 million of those dormant coins are likely to belong to the anonymous creator of Bitcoin, so we can take that portion out of the equation. A conservative estimate for lost coins therefore is about 2.4 million, or 11% of all bitcoins.
Cryptocurrency exchanges act like banks for crypto-users. You can exchange your traditional money like dollars or pounds for Bitcoin and other digital tokens. K33 researchers estimate that about 2.3 million bitcoins are kept by exchanges, either on behalf of customers or as float. Binance is the world's largest exchange and is estimated to have about 550,000 bitcoins - followed by Bitfinex (403,000), Coinbase (386,000), Robinhood (146,000) and OKX (126,000). In total it is thought exchanges hold about 11% of all bitcoins.
Leaving your coins on an exchange can go wrong though, for example with the collapse of FTX which left customers without access to their coins. Some Bitcoin purists are also uneasy about how a reliance on large and increasingly regulated and legally compliant exchanges goes against the anti-establishment ethos of Bitcoin.
A Bitcoin whale is someone who holds more than 10,000 bitcoins in their digital wallet. The website Bitinfocharts uses public blockchain records to keep a Bitcoin Rich List of the 100 richest wallets, and there are about 80 wallets with 10,000 coins or more, whose owners are unknown. Owning one of these wallets would make you a billionaire. Some of them might be the wallets of people or organisations which appear elsewhere in this graph but we will never know, unless a researcher makes the link or the whale outs themselves. A loose estimate is that large whales account for about 8% of all bitcoins.
The way that Bitcoin was invented means there can only ever be 21 million coins. Every coin has to be mined using a network of volunteer computers around the world. These computers - often owned by large Bitcoin mining companies - act like high-tech accountants checking and securing the record of Bitcoin transactions. In return for the work, the computers are automatically rewarded with Bitcoins.
Over time, the amount of coins given out as part of the mining reward is automatically reduced and in April it will halve again, squeezing the supply of new coins further. There are still about 7% of coins yet to be mined, and it is estimated that the last Bitcoin will be created in 2140.
The anonymous creator of Bitcoin holds an estimated 1.1 million bitcoins in wallets that were the first to be created in 2009. None of the coins have been moved in years, and no-one knows who Satoshi is - or even if he/ she/ they are still alive. If they are still alive - and estimates are correct - then this would make Satoshi Nakamoto roughly the 22nd richest person in the world. This stash is about 5% of all bitcoins.
In January, US financial authorities allowed regulated investment firms to start selling new financial products linked to Bitcoin, called Spot Bitcoin ETFs. In mid-February, the investment giants that applied to start ETFs began buying bitcoins in their thousands, as everything from hedge funds to stock market traders purchased ETFs to bet on the price of Bitcoin, without having to own any coins themselves.
According to K33 Research, 933,000 coins had already been allocated or purchased by 29 February, and are currently being held by the institutions for these new financial products. K33 analysts think that the biggest holder is Grayscale, which started as a digital currency investment firm. It is estimated to have around 450,000 bitcoins. Other giants include BlackRock (150,000) and Fidelity (102,000).
Most crypto-fans online are celebrating the rise in their personal fortunes thanks to the financial establishment pumping up Bitcoin's value through increased demand. But some have expressed concerns about a consolidation of power and wealth into the traditional regulated banking system that Bitcoin was invented to replace. These financial giants now hold about 4.5% of all coins. One wonders what Satoshi Nakamoto will think if and when the banks overtake him/ her in their bitcoin holdings.
Police forces around the world regularly bust cyber-crime gangs or illicit market places, seizing huge stashes of bitcoins in the process. There have been three major seizures of Bitcoin by the US since 2020. Eventually they will be sold at auction, but according to research from 21.co the funds have remained in their respective crypto-wallets and not moved, so there are nearly 200,000 bitcoins held from the busts. Arkham Intelligence has also linked a Bitcoin wallet address containing another 30,000 coins to the US takedown of the darknet market place Silk Road. The UK is thought to hold 61,000 bitcoins from a major seizure in 2018, and it is thought German police still have 50,000 coins from a recent operation.
Bitcoin believers are often depicted as having laser eyes in images on social media, and none burn brighter than those of software entrepreneur Michael Saylor. In 2020, he persuaded his enterprise software company to start buying up as much Bitcoin as they could, and he celebrates every purchase with a Tweet that invariably goes viral with crypto-fans. MicroStrategy, plus its subsidiaries, now has around 193,000 bitcoins, and is the largest single organisation owner of the digital coins.
In 2020, the CEO of crypto-software makers Block One tweeted that his company has continued buying bitcoins after an initial purchase of 140,000. So the true figure is likely to be much higher. The firm did not respond to our email.
In a flurry of disastrous hacks and mishaps, the world's first major crypto-exchange, Mt Gox, lost about 850,000 bitcoins in 2011. Mark Hunter, the author of a book about it, says there is still confusion about what happened to the coins, but it is assumed that the majority have been sold back to the open market by the thieves.
However, 80,000 bitcoins sit untouched in a now famous crypto- wallet address starting with '1Feex'. This stash will probably never be recovered or moved. Another 2,600 bitcoins were also accidentally and irreversibly destroyed during the chaos. Some of the customers who lost their savings in the hacks have begun to receive a portion back from recovered coins.
It is not known for sure how many Bitcoins the crypto-entrepreneur brothers own now, but in an interview in 2017 with the New York Times the twins revealed they had around 70,000, and said they had not sold any.
Tether is its own crypto token known as a stable coin, but the company behind it has been buying up bitcoins for years as part of its reserves. Industry watchers estimate the firm has around 67,000 bitcoins after a published audit in January said the company had the equivalent dollar amount of Bitcoin.
Bitcoin mining companies run warehouses full of powerful computers, whirring away to keep the public blockchain of transactions up-to-date. In exchange for the work, the Bitcoin system automatically rewards them bitcoins in a process called mining. Bitcoin mining is controversial because of the environmental cost of running the computers and keeping them cool. It has become harder over time to successfully mine for Bitcoin, so large companies make up the lion's share of the Bitcoin mining pool around the world.
Many of them are not public, but according to research from K33 the largest 8 publicly listed ones hold around 40,000 bitcoins. The largest include Marathon (16,000), Hut8 (9,000) and RIOT (7,600).
US venture capitalist investor Tim Draper made headlines in 2014 when he bought 30,000 bitcoins that had been seized by police from Silk Road and auctioned by the US government. At the time the coins cost him $17 million. Although he doesn't declare how many coins he now owns, he told crypto website Protos in 2022 that he has not sold any and is still buying bitcoins, so we can assume his holding has increased significantly.
The founder of Microstrategy tweeted in October 2020 that he personally holds 17,700 bitcoins. It is likely to be more by now.
Tesla's quarterly earnings at the end of 2023 didn't mention any changes to its finances with regard to its Bitcoin holdings. So we can assume that the company still owns just over 9,700 Bitcoins. In 2021, Elon Musk's company had purchased more than 40,000 coins, but sold off the majority in recent years.
Block, the payments company led by Jack Dorsey, the founder of Twitter, has long been a crypto- backer. In its latest earnings report, it said it had approximately 8,038 Bitcoins for investment purposes.
It is not known exactly how many bitcoins the billionaire investor owns, but in 2023 his company started buying bitcoins - spending $100m in total so far.
The Bitcoin-loving president of the Central American country El Salvador started buying Bitcoin with public money as part of a controversial investment plan for his country in 2021. The number of bitcoins here is gathered from his tweets by Dutch researcher Elias, who runs a website tracking the portfolio. Public records are not kept on exactly how many coins have been purchased or at what value.
A ball-park figure for how many bitcoins are held by the general public is what's left - 10.5m bitcoins. This is about 50% of all bitcoins that exist today when you take out all the above chunks that we know about. This number will be higher when you factor in the coins held by exchanges, as most of those are owned by people too. But it might also be lower if the number of lost coins is higher or the amount of coins that bitcoin whales are sitting on is more than we know.
No-one knows for sure how many individual people own bitcoins, but crypto-tech company River estimated that Bitcoin had 81.7 million users as of June 2023, or 1% of the global population.
Interestingly, research suggests that the latest surge in the value of Bitcoin is not coming because individual retail investors are buying bitcoins. Analysts at IntoTheBlock say Bitcoin whales like the big banks are pushing up price and demand - not an increase in ordinary people turning to this peer-to-peer digital cash.

2024-01-11T14:45:16.000Z,Gaming voice actors blindsided by 'garbage' union AI deal,BBC News,"Prominent voice actors say they weren't told about a landmark deal setting out how voices generated by artificial intelligence (AI) can be used in games.
It has been struck by US actors' union Sag-Aftra and AI firm Replica Studios.
The union says it guarantees ""fully informed consent and fair compensation"" for its members.
But many voice artists, who have long been concerned AI will replace them, have reacted with fury with one calling the deal ""garbage.""
In an email to members, seen by the BBC, Sag-Aftra said the deal was negotiated by a committee which included ""actors with significant and diverse experience performing in games"".
""The contract was specifically tailored to the needs of voice actors, ensuring informed consent and proper compensation terms that are unique to this set of performers,"" it said.
It comes after Sag-Aftra led a months-long strike in 2023 to fight for protections from film and television studios using AI.
Many voice actors have suggested this new deal is at odds with the purpose of that industrial action, with Fallout and Mortal Kombat voice actor Sunil Malhotra saying he ""sacrificed to strike half of last year to keep my profession alive, not shop around my AI replica"".
In a blog covering the announcement, Sag-Aftra said the deal was ""approved by affected members of the union's voiceover performer community"".
""Recent developments in AI technology have underscored the importance of protecting the rights of voice talent, particularly as game studios explore more efficient ways to create their games,"" said the union's chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland.
""With this agreement, we have achieved fully informed consent and fair compensation when it comes to the use of our members' voices and performances.""
But Steve Blum, a voice actor once credited by Guinness for being the most prolific in video games, said ""nobody"" he knew of had approved the deal.
According to Sag-Aftra, the agreement lays out terms and conditions for AI-generated voices in video games, which can be licensed by Replica Studios both in gaming and other forms of media.
It requires the AI firm to get consent from actors before it uses voices based on their likeness, and also gives voice actors the ability to deny their voice being used in perpetuity without their consent.
But it has been met with consternation from the performers themselves, with World of Warcraft voice actor Andrew Russell calling it ""garbage"", while Shelby Young, who will provide the voice of Yuko in the upcoming Persona 3: Reload, said she was ""really disappointed"" in the union.
Voice actors outside of gaming have also criticised the agreement, with Joshua Seth, known for voicing Tai in animated series Digimon, calling it a ""big mistake"", while audiobook narrator Paige Reisenfeld said she was ""ashamed"" that her union payments went towards it.
And Veronica Taylor, who provided the voice for Ash in Pokemon, asked how the deal was made without being put to a vote.
But Sag-Aftra president Fran Drescher said the deal was ""a great example of AI being done right"".
Meanwhile, Replica Studios CEO Shreya Nivas said the deal was an ""ethical approach"" to AI.
""We are excited by the new opportunities this opens up for world-leading AAA studios who can now access the benefits of Replica's AI voice technology while knowing that talent is recognized and compensated fairly for the use of their likeness,"" he said.

2024-02-06T15:24:24.000Z,Facebook and Instagram to label all fake AI images,BBC News,"Meta says it will introduce technology that can detect and label images generated by other companies' artificial intelligence (AI) tools.
It will be deployed on its platforms Facebook, Instagram and Threads.
Meta already labels AI images generated by its own systems. It says it hopes the new tech, which it is still building, will create ""momentum"" for the industry to tackle AI fakery.
But an AI expert told the BBC such tools are ""easily evadable"".
In a blog written by senior executive Sir Nick Clegg, Meta says it intends to expand its labelling of AI fakes ""in the coming months"".
In an interview with the Reuters news agency, he conceded the technology was ""not yet fully mature"" but said the company wanted to ""create a sense of momentum and incentive for the rest of the industry to follow"".
But Prof Soheil Feizi, director of the Reliable AI Lab at the University of Maryland, suggested such a system could be easy to get around.
""They may be able to train their detector to be able to flag some images specifically generated by some specific models,"" he told the BBC.
""But those detectors can be easily evaded by some lightweight processing on top of the images, and they also can have a high rate of false positives.
""So I don't think that it's possible for a broad range of applications.""
Meta has acknowledged its tool will not work for audio and video - despite these being the media that much of the concern about AI fakes is focused on.
The firm says it is instead asking users to label their own audio and video posts, and it ""may apply penalties if they fail to do so"".
Sir Nick Clegg also admitted it would be impossible to test for text that has been generated by tools such as ChatGPT.
""That ship has sailed,"" he told Reuters.
On Monday, Meta's Oversight Board criticised the company for its policy on manipulated media, calling it ""incoherent, lacking in persuasive justification and inappropriately focused on how content has been created"".
The Oversight Board is funded by Meta but independent of the company.
The criticism was in response to a ruling on a video of US President Joe Biden. The video in question edited existing footage of the president with his granddaughter to make it appear as though he was touching her inappropriately.
Because it was not manipulated using artificial intelligence, and depicted Mr Biden behaving in a way he did not, rather than saying something he did not, it did not violate Meta's manipulated media policy - and was not removed.
The Board agreed that the video did not break Meta's current rules on fake media, but said that the rules should be updated.
Sir Nick told Reuters that he broadly agreed with the ruling.
He admitted that Meta's existing policy ""is just simply not fit for purpose in an environment where you're going to have way more synthetic content and hybrid content than before.""
From January, the company has had a policy in place which says political adverts have to signal when they are using digitally altered images or video.

2024-02-09T18:46:03.000Z,How can you keep children safe online and what parental controls are there?,BBC News,"The question of how to keep children safe online is never far from parents' minds, but has come into increasing focus following the murder of 16-year-old Brianna Ghey.
Scarlett Jenkinson and Eddie Ratcliffe, who killed Brianna when they were 15, plotted the murder using messaging apps. Jenkinson had watched videos of violence and torture on the dark web.
Brianna's mother, Esther, says the government should make it harder for young people to access potentially harmful material online.
But what steps can parents take now to make their children's digital lives as safe as possible?
Children aged eight to 17 spend between two and five hours online per day, research by the communications regulator Ofcom suggests. Time spent online increases with age.
Nearly every child over 12 has a mobile phone and almost all of them watch videos on platforms such as YouTube or TikTok.
Four in five teenagers who go online say they have used AI tools such as ChatGPT or Snapchat's MyAI.
About half of children over 12 think being online is good for their mental health, according to Ofcom.
But there is a significant minority for whom that is not the case. One in eight children aged eight to 17 said someone had been nasty or hurtful to them on social media, or messaging apps.
The Children's Commissioner said half of the 13-year-olds her team surveyed reported seeing ""hardcore, misogynistic"" pornographic material on social media sites.
Parents concerned about what their children are seeing online can take some simple practical steps.
The most obvious is to learn about control functions, which two-thirds of parents say they use, according to Internet Matters, a safety organisation set up by some of the big UK-based internet companies.
It has a list of parental controls available and step-by-step guides on how to use them.
The way these work varies. However, those available with YouTube - the most popular platform for young people in the UK - are a good indication of the kinds of tools available.
Parents who want to reduce the likelihood of their children seeing unsuitable material can set them up with the ""kids"" version of YouTube, which filters out adult content.
Or, if their children are older and want to use the main site, adults can make their accounts supervised. This means they are able to review what sites they have visited.
Supervision can also be set up on Facebook messenger, via its Family Centre.
And TikTok says its family pairing tool enables parents to decide if a teenager's account is private or public.
Of course, these controls are not fool-proof.
Some adults find setting them up confusing, and some children find ways of getting round them. Ofcom data suggests about one in 20 children use workarounds.
Phone networks may block some explicit websites until a user has demonstrated they are over 18.
Some also have parental controls that can limit the websites children can visit on their phones.
Android and Apple phones and tablets have apps and systems parents can use.
These can block or limit access to specific apps, restrict explicit content, prevent purchases and monitor browsing.
Apple has Screen Time and Google has Family Link. There are similar apps available from third-party developers.
Broadband services also have parental controls to filter certain types of content.
So do games consoles - allowing parents to ensure age-appropriate gaming and control in-game purchases.
Talking to children about online safety and being interested in what they do online is also important, charities including the NSPCC say.
Making discussions about it part of daily conversation, just like a chat about their day at school, can make children comfortable with the topic.
It can also make children more likely to share any concerns they have.
The government says its new law, the Online Safety Act, will force social media firms and search engines to do more to protect users, particularly children.
It seeks to force tech firms to take more responsibility for the content on their platforms.
However, the new legislation will take some time before it is fully enforced.
And there have been recent calls for more to be done.
Esther Ghey says the Online Safety Act does not go far enough and children must be stopped from having access to social media apps.
She also wants parents to be able to download software to alert them to worrying content their children might be searching for.
Conservative MP Miriam Cates has called on Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to consider banning under 16s from social media and smartphones.
However Mr Sunak has said that the Online Safety Act ""protects children from harmful or inappropriate"" material.

2024-01-13T03:14:55.000Z,CES 2024: Trying out an AI mirror,BBC News,,Technology
2024-01-13T03:15:00.000Z,CES 2024: AI pillows and toothbrushes - is it all getting a bit silly?,BBC News,"""Come get your AI pillow - stop snoring tonight!""
I'm walking around CES - the tech industry's annual showcase of all its latest gadgets - in a bit of a daze, until this pitch grabs my attention.
What on earth is an AI pillow?
Motion Sleep, a South Korean company, has a large space in one of the main exhibition halls at CES. Intrigued, I wander in.
First I'm offered a few stats about the consequences of bad sleep. One sign points to the number of accidents caused by drowsy driving. Another goes through the health consequences of sleep apnoea.
The solution the company has landed on is a pillow that detects snoring. It then pumps air into different compartments of a pillow, which gently lifts the head, making the offending snorer roll over and - in theory - alleviating snoring.
This is a pretty typical CES product so far. There are thousands of these kinds of inventions that may or may not take off.
But this pillow is different, we are told. This pillow contains AI.
""With the AI, it can be trained to know what you sound like specifically when you snore,"" a representative insists.
""That way it can differentiate between you snoring and the TV or cars outside.""
And the pillow is far from the only device to lay claim to the special power that, we are meant to believe, AI confers. At Samsung's exhibit, for example, an entire section was devoted to AI-capable household devices.
I'm shown an AI vacuum cleaner - that looks very much like a normal vacuum cleaner - with one small difference.
An ""AI"" function mode apparently allows the vacuum to assess types of surfaces. It can then apply different levels of suction accordingly.
There's an AI washing machine that can purportedly detect different types of fabric too.
""AI Wash uses sensors to sense the laundry's weight and level of soiling, and optimises the amount of water, detergent and rinsing time, using machine learning,"" a Samsung press release says.
I'm shown the washing machine by a Samsung representative. I'm still slightly puzzled about how this is actually using AI.
""This will learn your clothes,"" they say. I remain confused.
Elsewhere at the show, there's an AI mirror and even an AI toothbrush. No product is too boring or humdrum, it seems, to escape an AI makeover.
The explanation, perhaps, is that all of these companies are facing pressure from investors and shareholders to have some kind of AI offering, because it attracts attention and investment.
OpenAI's incredibly successful launch of ChatGPT is why everyone is talking about AI - and the potential it has.
This is a large language model (LLM) that uses a type of machine learning to produce detailed and human-like answers to questions.
But an AI toothbrush or vacuum is a very long way away from ChatGPT.
And that takes us neatly to one of the major problems with AI more generally. It has no universally accepted definition.
""AI suffers from an unrelenting, incurable case of vagueness,"" Eric Siegel, a machine learning expert, told me over the summer.
That lack of a definition means that all things AI have been caught up in a blistering year of hype.
That's the case with products that already contained AI without much fanfare before. Now their AI capability, however obscure, is hammed up.
But there is a problem with this craze for all things AI: Companies claiming AI capability when really their products don't actually use machine learning.
The Federal Trade Commission in the US has put out advisory notes aimed at companies stretching the definition of AI.
""Does the product actually use AI at all? If you think you can get away with baseless claims that your product is AI-enabled, think again,"" a note from the FTC published in February last year says.
Yet in that same note, the FTC accepts that AI is ""an ambiguous term with many possible definitions"".
That's clearly a problem for consumers - but it's also a problem for journalists. For years now I've covered companies that claim to be using AI in their products. Often they provide no evidence to back this assertion up - often saying the technology is proprietary.
It's very hard then to know what the engine looks like when you can't look under the bonnet.
Some companies are already aware that the use of the term AI has become counter-productive. One product that has had rave reviews this year at CES is called R1, made by Rabbit. The phone like device uses a form of generative AI - and allows users to circumvent apps, and simply ask for things to be done. Like booking a flight or taxi.
But in Rabbit's pitch, AI is barely mentioned. Instead the company talks about foundation models, and even a new term: Large Action Models.
Back at Samsung, I come across a product that clearly does use generative AI: A fridge that analyses the food in it and can suggest recipes. At last something that appears to be pretty obviously AI.
But then I'm hit with another question. Do I need my fridge to give me recipes? I have never felt frustrated about the lack of culinary advice given to me by my fridge.
So for now, I'm going to stick to my non-AI capable pillow, my non-AI capable washing machine and my non-AI vacuum cleaner. And, I think, the chances are you will too.

2024-01-22T14:51:18.000Z,Cryptocurrency firm Terraform Labs files for bankruptcy in US,BBC News,"The cryptocurrency company behind the crashed TerraUSD and Luna tokens has filed for bankruptcy in the US.
Terraform Labs' tokens collapsed in May, losing $40bn of their value and contributing to the so-called ""cryptocrash"" of 2022.
Co-founder Do Kwon is currently in jail in Montenegro after having been found guilty of forging documents.
He has been charged with defrauding investors by US regulators and is awaiting extradition.
He also faces fraud charges in South Korea, his native country, so could be extradited there.
A third legal case is ongoing in Singapore, where the company is registered.
Terraform Labs' Luna token came to prominence in December 2021, when its value began to rise from $5 to a high of $116 in April 2022.
Fans of Luna became known as ""Lunatics"", with Mr Kwon referred to as their ""king"".
Then suddenly, on 9 May 2022, it collapsed, losing 99% of its value in just 48 hours.
It was algorithmically linked to its sister coin, TerraUSD, which was a stablecoin, meaning it was meant to stay at at a value of $1.
But the value of TerraUSD plummeted to about $0.02 - which then caused the Luna coin to nosedive.
The crash led to shockwaves around the crypto market, with investors pulling billions of dollars from other cryptocurrencies in fear of a similar crash.
It is estimated that about $400bn was wiped from the value of other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.
Announcing the bankruptcy filing, Terraform Labs chief executive Chris Amani said: ""This action is necessary to allow us to continue working toward our collective goals while resolving the legal challenges that remain outstanding.""
Terraform ""intends to meet all financial obligations to employees and vendors during the Chapter 11 case and does not require additional financing to do so,"" the company said in a statement.
A Chapter 11 bankruptcy means that Terraform Labs can continue to do business.
The firm offers blockchain and other Web3-related services.
The bankruptcy documents, filed in Baltimore, list Terraform as having between $100m and $500m in assets.
They also say Do Kwon owns 92% of the shares of the company, with his co-founder Daniel Hyunsung Shin owning the other 8%.
Mr Kwon was arrested in Montenegro in March 2023 as he tried to board a plane to Dubai.
Three months later, he was found guilty of forging documents - which he denied - and sentenced to jail.
The former finance officer of Terraform Labs, Han Chang-joon, was also sentenced to prison after being found guilty of the same charges.
According to Reuters, police had found doctored Costa Rican passports and a separate set of Belgian passports among their luggage.
In November 2023 a court in Montenegro approved his extradition, but was yet to decide whether it would be to South Korea or the US.

Almost a third told the Bank they'd made significant AI investments in the past year.
Mr Bailey added ""I'm an economic historian, before I became a central banker. Economies adapt, jobs adapt, and we learn to work with it. And I think, you get a better result by people with machines than with machines on their own. So I'm an optimist…""
In its latest assessment of the UK economy the Bank's business contacts said that automation and AI investment was already ""containing recruitment and labour costs"" in a tight labour market.
Mr Bailey's comments come as a committee that sits in the House of Lords says that we should embrace the positives of AI rather than just focus on its risks.
The committee's chair Baroness Stowell told the BBC that talk of ""existential risks and sci-fi scenarios"" should not get in the way of reaping the rewards of AI.
AI goldrush
The country could ""miss out on the AI goldrush,"" her committee's report said.
It said some of the ""apocalyptic"" warnings about AI's dangers were exaggerated.
The Lords Communications and Digital Committee's report focuses on large language models (LLMs), which are what power generative AI tools like ChatGPT.
They have captured people's imaginations with their ability to, for example, give human-like responses to questions.
But they have also prompted concerns, including from various senior industry figures, that the technology could cause problems ranging from eliminating jobs to threatening humanity itself.
The UK hosted the world's first AI Safety Summit in November 2023, where a global declaration on managing AI risks was announced..
But Baroness Stowell warned that the government needed to be careful the UK didn't end up as ""the safety people"".
""No expert on safety is going to be credible if we are not at the same time developers and part of the real vanguard of promoting and creating the progress on this technology"", she said.
Given there is no UK equivalent of ChatGPT, and in order to avoid another situation in which - as with other areas of tech - all of the industry giants are clustered elsewhere, the Lords committee seems to be essentially warning the country to go easy on the red tape.
The Committee has also highlighted the issue of copyright, which is particularly contentious with AI.
That's because LLMs rely on being fed information from things that already exist digitally, and there are questions over whether developers have properly sought permission for it.
Photo agency Getty Images is currently taking legal action against Stability AI, claiming that the tech company has used its images without permission to train its picture generation tools.
The Committee is calling on the government to provide clarity over what rules apply, saying it can not ""sit on its hands"" while LLM developers ""exploit"" the works of rightsholders.
""The government needs to come out with its position,"" Baroness Stowell told the BBC.
Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology Michelle Donelan will give evidence to the Lords Communications and Digital Committee on Tuesday, where she is expected to be questioned on the government's reaction to the report.
A Department for Science, Innovation and Technology spokesperson said:  ""We do not accept this - the UK is a clear leader in AI research and development, and as a government we are already backing AI's boundless potential to improve lives, pouring millions of pounds into rolling out solutions that will transform healthcare, education and business growth, including through our newly announced AI Opportunity Forum.
They added: ""The future of AI is safe AI. It is only by addressing the risks of today and tomorrow that we can harness its incredible opportunities and attract even more of the jobs and investment that will come from this new wave of technology.
""That's why [we] have spent more than any other government on safety research through the AI Safety Institute and are promoting a pro-innovation approach to AI regulation.""

2024-02-15T22:20:33.000Z,"Xbox, Nintendo or PlayStation: does it still matter?",BBC News,"Four Microsoft Xbox video games - and the firm was frustratingly careful not to name them - will now be opened up to alternative platforms for the first time,  boss Phil Spencer announced to the world last night.
He gave only a couple of clues: all four are community-driven, more than one year old, and they do not include recent releases Starfield or Indiana Jones.
This feels like a big change of gear for Microsoft, which has long favoured exclusivity to its own Xbox platform and Games Pass subscription service.
So what's behind the shift and what does it tell us about the future of gaming?
Let's start with a 12 year old I know - my son.
He loves Minecraft, and plays it wherever he can. On his phone, on his tablet, on our PlayStation, on his dad's Xbox. He watches Minecraft videos on YouTube and he uses an unofficial app to create and share skins and mods.
He doesn't care who owns the game (Microsoft bought the Mojang studio in 2014) and he has no brand loyalty to a particular device - his favourite is whichever one is to hand.
This is what the games giants are up against: a generation of young gamers who don't buy into their hype.
It appears that Microsoft is starting, very cautiously, to respond to that.
Last night Mr Spencer insisted the four latest games did not signify a fundamental change in the firm's games strategy.
But then he added: ""I have a fundamental belief that in the next five to 10 years, exclusive games, which are exclusive to one piece of hardware, are going to be a smaller and smaller part of the games industry.""
And it's not just Xbox warming to the idea - there have been similar rumblings from Sony. In a recent earnings call, interim gaming president Hiroki Totoki said that he wanted to put more PlayStation games onto other platforms.
Much like Microsoft, he did not name any particular games, or specific platforms. It is possible he meant the firm would continue with the status quo of putting PlayStation games onto PC several months or even years after their release.
Following years of fierce rivalry between the two firms, and expensive acquisitions of successful games studios producing the most popular games, in an attempt to lock in the best content to their own customers, this is definitely a change of heart (Nintendo meanwhile, still has more of a tendency to keep its games to itself).
The idea of basically turning any device with a screen into your company's console is blisteringly simple, when you think about it. Why go through the expensive and time-consuming process of building and selling proprietary hardware when so many people are essentially carrying around a high-performance computer already, in the form of their phones?
Why restrict access to your best-selling titles when there's a vast audience with alternative devices out there who also want to buy them, play them, and pay for in-game extras?
The analysts Ampere estimated that in 2023 there were a total of around 46.5m consoles sold, of which only 7.6m were Microsoft's Xbox. That leaves nearly 39 million gamers that Xbox exclusives such as the long awaited Starfield from Bethesda, didn't reach.
You begin to see that this is an old-fashioned business model, with an old-fashioned motive: money.
""The key reason Microsoft has been pursuing a more progressive multi-platform strategy with its games content and services since early in the Xbox One cycle is because it was unable to build on the relative success of the Xbox 360 era and take market share from Sony, and latterly, Nintendo post-the launch of the Switch,"" says analyst Piers Harding-Rolls from Ampere.
In addition Microsoft has been busy hoovering up successful games studios for large amounts of cash - at a time when making games is already an expensive business.
Indeed, during its contentious $68bn acquisition of the massive games maker Activision Blizzard, one of Sony's chief objections was that it could make smash hits like Call of Duty, played by millions on PlayStations, Xbox-exclusives. Microsoft was forced to promise that it would not do so for at least 10 years.
There has even been speculation that Microsoft might be preparing to walk away from the hardware market altogether, abandoning the Xbox console entirely, but Mr Harding-Rolls doesn't think something that dramatic is on the horizon.
""Ampere does not expect Microsoft to exit the console platform business in the medium term as that would leave a gaping hole in its games-related revenues,"" he added.
Indeed, Xbox president Sarah Bond even teased the idea of some brand new hardware in a podcast released by Microsoft on Thursday.
""What we're really focused on there is delivering the largest technical leap you will have ever seen in a hardware generation,"" she said.
Unfortunately, your guess about that at this stage is as good as ours, although the rumour mill is going into overdrive that it could be some kind of handheld device, designed to compete with the huge success of the Nintendo Switch.
In any case Darren Edwards from gaming news website TheXboxHub sums it up neatly: ""It's hardly a doomsday scenario for Xbox.""
As for the games themselves, Microsoft's preferred gateway is via Games Pass. For £12.99 per month, it offers unlimited streaming access to hundreds of titles.
The firm has been very quiet for a while about subscriber numbers, but tonight revealed it had hit 34m. It launched in 2017 with an ambition to hit 100m by 2030, a goal that still feels some way off, with six years to go.
But it's still good news for those making games which are on the Games Pass, like the UK-based publisher No More Robots.
""We want as many people on Game Pass as possible, because that naturally leads to more people playing our titles, which is especially useful for multiplayer titles that require larger player counts to keep the community alive,"" said director Mike Rose.
Needless to say there are also a lot of relieved Xbox owners on social media right now. Many felt the announcement was an anti-climax after days of anticipation, and it certainly threw up more questions than answers. But at least the message was more business as usual than console bonfire.
One gamer on X summed up the most popular view: ""Xbox isn't going away or going 3rd party. Can we all chill now?""

2024-02-23T00:07:18.000Z,The 'mind-bending' bionic arm powered by AI,BBC News,"I was born without lower arms and legs, so I've been around prosthetics of all shapes and sizes for as long as I can remember.
I've actively avoided those designed for upper arms for most of my adult life, so have never used a bionic hand before.
But when I visited a company in California, which is seeking to take the technology to the next level, I was intrigued enough to try one out - and the results were, frankly, mind-bending.
Prosthetic limbs have come a long way since the early days when they were fashioned out of wood, tin and leather.
Modern-day replacement arms and legs are made of silicone and carbon fibre, and increasingly they are bionic, meaning they have various electronically controlled moving parts to make them more useful to the user.
What the company I visited, Atom Limbs, is doing is combining a range of cutting-edge innovations, including artificial intelligence (AI), into a next-generation bionic arm.
Atom Limbs uses advanced sensors and machine learning - where computers train themselves to become more accurate -  to interpret electrical signals from a person's brain and use them to move and manipulate a prosthetic limb.
The arm has a full range of human motion in the elbow, wrist, and individual fingers - and it provides haptic feedback to the wearer on their grip strength.
The arm attaches via a strengthened sportswear-style vest which distributes the weight of the arm evenly. Although it still has some weight to it, it is considerably lighter than other bionic arms I've seen.
It's non-invasive, meaning it doesn't need any surgery or implants to function. It connects to the wearer's residual limb firstly with bands of sensors that measure electrical signals, and then via a cup that fits over the top, with the arm connecting via an interface.
Despite avoiding upper-arm prosthetics before, when Atom Limbs said I could have a try at operating a digital version of the arm on a computer screen, via their control software, I was interested enough to say yes.
I do have residual muscles in my arm that I was able to ""assign"" to corresponding hand, wrist and elbow movements, which proved to be a unique, mind-boggling experience.
The notion of learning how to control a part of the body I don't have is almost impossible to describe.
However, exciting though this technology is, one issue that is always of concern to disabled people when new products come into being is cost.
The assistive devices landscape is littered with products that, while impressive, can cost many times an average yearly salary. That puts most devices out of reach for many disabled people who statistics show are more likely to be among the poorest in society.
Atom Limbs says it hopes its arm will be positioned around the $20,000 (£15,000) price point, which - while still a hefty sum of money - is considerably less than many other bionic products on the market.
Ian Adam, a lecturer in prosthetics and orthotics at the University of Derby, says while this may sound like a lot, it is a good price in the industry - though it won't be for everyone.
""It's at the cheaper end of the market, but say you had an accident and got a pay-out, well that's got to last the rest of your life,"" he said.
""So I think a lot of patients are canny about what they spend their money on... sometimes people are quite prepared to not use them at all - with upper limb prosthetics it can be just an extra thing that not everybody will decide they need to have.""
And then there are the ethical and practical issues around such products.
In 2022 Britt H Young, herself a bionic arm user, questioned whether the prosthetics ""arms race"" has focused too much on innovation rather than application.
Social media star Tilly Lockey, who has been using bionic arms since she was 9 years old, is excited about their future potential - but she told the BBC whether this device made a difference would all come down to testing.
""I've seen like them change so much first-hand, but I've also seen them throughout the development phases,"" she said.
""There's a lot of ambitious projects, but I think the way they truly get there is the back and forth development from the users who actually wear them every day.""
Ultimately, the Atom Limbs arm is still early in development.
The firm is collecting data ahead of regulatory filings in the US, which means it will be some time yet before we see them being used in every day life.

2024-02-14T12:42:42.000Z,Meta boss Zuckerberg takes a swipe at rival Apple,BBC News,"Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg has taken a personal swipe at rival company Apple's new headset.
The Vision Pro grabbed headlines as celebrities including Diplo and T-Pain wore it in public, with the ""passthrough"" feature allowing them to see their surroundings while using it.
But in a video shot using the Meta Quest 3's own passthrough, Zuckerberg insisted his company's headset is ""the best product, period"".
Apple has been approached for comment.
Passthrough is a feature used by the most recent mixed reality headsets, which allows people to see beyond the screen strapped to their head.
By utilising cameras on the outside of the headset, users are given a live, high-definition video feed of their surroundings - meaning they can wear a headset while walking or exercising.
Meta has been working on this technology for the better part of a decade, and it also features on rival products such as Sony's PlayStation VR 2.
But it is clearly the source of frustration for Zuckerberg that the Vision Pro is being praised over technology that exists elsewhere.
""I think Quest is the better product, period,"" he said.
""It seems like there are a lot of people who just assumed that Vision Pro would be higher quality because it's Apple and it costs $3,000 (£2,400) more.
""But honestly, I'm pretty surprised that Quest is so much better for the vast majority of things that people use these headsets for with that price differential.""
It comes as several people have started to post on social media about returning their Apple headsets, with product manager Parker Ortolani among those praising the device but saying the ""physical trade-offs are just not worth it"".
Zuckerberg spent much of the video trying to stress why the Quest 3 was better, with reasons ranging from the ability to move around easily without a cable, and socialising - but above all making multiple digs at the difference in price.
""I expected that Quest would be the better value for most people since it's really good and it's like seven times less expensive,"" he said.
""I think it's just a lot more comfortable, and we designed it to weigh 120 grams less which makes a really big difference on your face.
""There's no wires that get in the way when you move around - it's a big deal.""
He also said the Quest 3 had a wider field of view, and he believed it had a brighter screen too.
Zuckerberg did accept the Vision Pro had some advantages - in particular a higher resolution - but said he was ""surprised by how many trade-offs they had to make"" in other areas to achieve it.
He also praised the eye-tracking on Apple's headset, which is a feature not present in the Quest 3.
Zuckerberg ended the video by talking about what mixed reality might look like in the future.
In a surprising move, he directly criticised ""fanboys"" who ""get upset whenever anyone dares to question if Apple's going to be the leader"" in a type of technology.
""But the reality is that every generation of computing has an open and a closed model,"" he said, referring to how Apple controls what can and can't be installed on its devices.
""And yeah, in mobile, Apple's closed model won, but it's not always that way - if you go back to the PC era, Microsoft's open model was the winner.
""In this next generation, Meta is going to be the open model, and I really want to make sure that the open model wins out again.""

2024-01-31T15:01:21.000Z,ChatGPT: Italy says OpenAI's chatbot breaches data protection rules,BBC News,"ChatGPT, the artificial intelligence-powered chatbot, breaches rules on data protection, an Italian watchdog says.
An inquiry by Italy's Data Protection Authority (DPA) found data privacy violations, which the BBC understands are related to collecting personal data and age protections.
The chatbot relies on being fed large amounts of data from the internet.
ChatGPT's maker OpenAI told the BBC it believed its practices ""aligned"" with privacy laws.
""We want our AI to learn about the world, not about private individuals"", it said in a statement.
""We actively work to reduce personal data in training our systems like ChatGPT, which also rejects requests for private or sensitive information about people"".
It has 30 days to respond with its defence.
Italy has taken a firm stance on data protection when it comes to ChatGPT.
It was the first Western country to block the product in March 2023, citing privacy concerns.
ChatGPT was reinstated around four weeks later, after stating it had successfully ""addressed or clarified"" the issues raised by the DPA.
Italy's DPA launched a ""fact-finding activity"" at the time, which it says has now found data privacy violations.
In a statement, the DPA said it ""concluded that the available evidence pointed to the existence of breaches of the provisions contained in the EU GDPR [General Data Protection Regulation]"".
They are related to mass collection of users' data which is then used to train the algorithm.
The regulator is also concerned that younger users may be exposed to inappropriate content generated by the chatbot.
Under the EU's GDPR law, firms which break the rules can be fined up to 4% of the company's global turnover.
Italy's DPA works alongside the European Union's European Data Protection Board - which set up a special task force to monitor ChatGPT in April 2023.
At the time of ChatGPT's reinstatement in Italy in April 2023, the Italian regulator told the BBC that it ""welcomed the measures OpenAI implemented"" but called for even more compliance.
In particular, a spokesperson said, it wanted more action around ""implementing an age verification system and planning and conducting an information campaign to inform Italians of what happened as well as of their right to opt-out from the processing of their personal data for training algorithms"".
An OpenAI spokesperson said at the time that it would continue talks with the regulator.
OpenAI has close links with tech giant Microsoft, which has invested billions of dollars into the company.
Microsoft has integrated AI into its Bing search engine, as well as its Office 365 apps such as Word, Teams and Outlook.

Anyone who signs up to the voluntary scheme will get an icon on their profile, verifying their age and likeness are authentic.
The dating app has been repeatedly targeted by fraudsters.
The charity Victim Support said the move was welcome but added platforms like Tinder needed to ""go further"".
""Ensuring ID verification is mandatory across all dating apps, rather than optional, would be more robust,"" charity spokesman Wayne Stevens told the BBC.
""Romance fraud is a devastating crime, particularly because of the shame and stigma around it.""
The fraud - also known as catfishing - involves a person entering a relationship while pretending to be someone else.
Their goal can be to deceive someone into a romantic relationship, often with the aim of scamming money from them.
There have been calls for tougher action to combat the practice.
Tinder says the system it is introducing should give users more confidence that the people they meet on the app are who they say they are.
It will see users who verify a photo receiving a blue camera icon badge, and those who prove their ID is authentic getting a blue ID icon badge. Anyone who completes both steps will be given a blue checkmark.
The system was introduced in Australia and New Zealand in 2023.
The firm says those who chose to be verified in these countries were far more likely to get a match - with a 67% increase in matches compared with unverified users.
Along with the UK, the tool is also being brought in for people based in the US, Brazil and Mexico.
It is not the first such initiative from the app - which has been downloaded more than half a billion times, and describes itself as the ""world's most popular app for meeting new people.""
It has previously tried to verify people through selfies as well as giving blue checkmarks to celebrities.

2024-01-29T14:41:48.000Z,Has great white shark newborn been caught on film for the first time?,BBC News,"The gap in our knowledge of great white sharks may have just been narrowed thanks to a YouTuber.
As far as experts are aware, the birth of a great white shark has never been witnessed, but Carlos Gauna may have captured the closest thing to that.
Carlos has found fame on YouTube as TheMalibuArtist and has filmed incredible shots of sharks from above with his drone.
""You're basically viewing the sharks through a magnifying glass that they don't know is watching them,"" he says.
His YouTube videos, which have racked up tens of millions of views, often show great whites swimming concerningly close to humans.
""It does raise my heart rate sometimes. I've yet to see a shark get aggressive with or show aggressive behaviour around a human, but [it's] just human instinct,"" he says.
On a beach near Santa Barbara, California, last year, a sighting of a different nature got Carlos's pulse going.
He had already seen large sharks in the area when he stumbled across something he had never seen before.
""This little bitty white, almost albino-looking, white shark came up to the surface,"" he says.
As Carlos brought down his drone closer, more details of the shark emerged. It was white all over, but the white layer seemed to be flaking off.
At the time, Carlos was with shark researcher Phil Sternes, from the University of California, Riverside, who could not believe what he was seeing.
""I'm like, 'oh my goodness, this could be a newborn',"" he says.
""We're both falling out of our seats with excitement at that point. It was quite a moment.""
What got Phil particularly excited was the shape of the shark, whose fins were more rounded than usual. That is something you see in shark embryos and newborns.
He says the white layer could have been evidence the shark had just been born and still had a mucus-like substance on its body.
James Worthington, from the University of San Diego, helped the pair size the shark. Using the drone's distance from the sea surface and the crop factor, he worked out it was roughly 1.5m (4.9ft) long - about the right size for a newborn.
Their observation has been published in the journal Environmental Biology of Fishes.
However, some marine biologists urge caution at jumping to the conclusion that it is definitely a newborn great white shark.
Dr Chris Lowe, from California State University's shark lab believes the finding is interesting, but there are other explanations for the white layer.
""Sure, this could be a newborn shark, or it could be a shark with a skin disease, or it could be a number of other things we haven't even thought of,"" he says.
""Unfortunately, it's a sample size of one. I think many scientists would agree that in order for us to consider this area of pupping location, we would need a lot more evidence.""
In their report, Phil and Carlos acknowledge that the shark could have a skin condition, but Phil says: ""What's unique about this shark is it has a white layer.
""I looked in the literature extensively, we couldn't find anything that matches up to this. So it could be an unknown skin condition that's never been documented before, which is also unique.""
However, they believe that theory ignores other evidence from Carlos's video  - the aggressiveness of the flaking, the shape of the fins and the size of the shark.
Drones have ushered in a revolution in shark filming, and not just for citizen scientists like Carlos. They are used by shark scientists to analyse the fish's behaviour, with some amazing observations.
""We just completed a two-year study where one of my grad students went out and flew drone surveys at 26 California beaches every month for two years,"" Dr Lowe says.
""What they found was that aggregation sites where we have juvenile white sharks day in day out, there were interactions with people every single day - multiple interactions.""
That is exactly what Carlos finds. Great whites are much more common along California's beaches than you might think, and it is not uncommon for them to get close to humans.
Armed with a drone and patience, he is hoping to one day become the first person to film one being born.

US customers have been given the option to pre-order the $3,499 (£2,749) mixed-reality device from mid-January. No date has been set for a UK launch.
After years of rumours during development, the company revealed the device in June 2023.
It is the first major new product to be released by the firm since the Apple Watch launched in 2015.
But it has already encountered some issues. According to the Financial Times, Apple has more than halved its production forecasts, dropping from an estimated one million units to 400,000 in 2024.
As well as the release date, Apple also announced the device will have 256GB of storage, and it clarified that the headset's eye-tracking technology can function by monitoring just one dominant eye, for people who do not have full use of both their eyes.
But interestingly the firm is trying to separate the headset from other devices on the market, telling developers for the device to instead brand their apps as ""spatial computing"".
""Don't describe your app experience as augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), extended reality (XR), or mixed reality (MR),"" it said in a blog post targeting developers.
Apple has also released a trailer online, featuring characters from films donning goggles and helmets, in what feels like an attempt to recreate the hype around the launch of the iPhone in 2007.
If successful, this could be a new multi-billion dollar source of income for Apple.
But as many people all over the world struggle to afford life's basics, the high price tag is likely to keep this in the realm of a toy for the well-off.
Another of the tech giants, Meta, has opted for a lower priced headset, in its big bet on the still emerging virtual and mixed reality headset market.
Its Quest 3 costs $499 in the US and retails for £479 in the UK.
Despite the lower price tag it has also struggled to achieve mass market appeal,
There are also on-going issues with how comfortable the devices are to use, especially, for long periods, which may also be stopping them going mainstream.
The BBC had the opportunity to try out the Vision Pro in June last year, and found mixed reality to be a mixed bag.
We were among the few news organisations in the world allowed to test out the device - but no photos or filming were allowed.
Unlike many existing headsets, Apple has detached the battery, so it doesn't sit heavy on your head - although it does mean the battery has to sit beside you instead, attached to a cable.
The user experience is classic, minimalist Apple. Once the headset is on, you see the room around you but you're not seeing it through glass, you're seeing it through the many on-board cameras.
This is the ""mixed-reality"" experience - digital content projected on to your surroundings.
You physically press a single button on the top right-hand side of the headset, and up pops familiar app icons you'll recognise if you have used an iPhone - iMessage, Photos, Apple TV (there will be more as developers make them).
And from then on it's all about gesture control - the headset tracks where you are looking so when you look at an app and pinch your thumb and forefinger together, it opens.
You can choose your level of immersion using a physical dial to turn up or down the size of whatever it is that you're looking at. It can fill the entire room or appear like a TV screen superimposed against your wall.
But if someone walks in front of you in real life, you can see them no matter how immersed you are.
Still, whenever there was an issue with the demo, an Apple employee would remind us that it was not a finished product, and Apple's ban on any filming during the demonstration meant that these issues couldn't be recorded or shared online.

It is the second report of the brakes failing on this particular model while in motion.
Mr Phillips said it was ""terrifying"" to feel ""out of control"" of the vehicle while his family were also inside.
Jaguar said it was investigating and took both claims seriously.
Earlier this week, another I-Pace driver claimed to have found himself unable to brake on a motorway as the car accelerated and had to be flanked by police.
""Following the incident involving a Jaguar I-Pace on the M62 on the afternoon of 6th March, we are looking into this matter with urgency,"" Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) said.
""A full review is underway to determine the cause of this incident, which is still yet to be established. The safety of our clients and vehicles is JLR's highest priority.""
It said it was also taking Mr Phillips' claims seriously.
Mr Phillips' experience, first reported by the Daily Mail, happened on New Year's Eve 2023.
He told BBC News: ""In the afternoon, I'd set off from home with my wife and kids in the back of the car. I'd barely gone a mile from home and as I came to traffic lights, travelling at about 30mph, three cars away from the lights I could not brake.
""I was pushing on the pedal, but the hydraulic felt like it was pushing my foot up. My whole body was locked up trying to push down on the brake.""
He said fortunately the lights then changed from red as he could not have physically stopped.
""I immediately returned home really slowly. I didn't want to go above 10 to 15mph. I would not want anyone else to be in the same situation, particularly with children in the back.""
He had owned the car for more than three years and has now returned it. He called for a full recall of the model by Jaguar as a safety precaution.
A Jaguar Land Rover spokesperson said: ""We are taking these recent claims by Mr Phillips very seriously and are looking into his complaint. In addition we are concerned to hear that Mr Phillips may not have received the high levels of care to which we hold ourselves accountable.
""Our client experience as well as the safety of our clients and vehicles is JLR's highest priority.""
Like many electric vehicles, the Jaguar I-Pace offers regenerative braking, in which the energy created as the car brakes is re-captured and sent back to the battery. Thousands of the cars have been sold in the UK since 2018, which cost nearly £70,000.
In 2019, some Jaguar I-Pace vehicles were recalled in North America because of a fault with the system.
Jaguar was already due to end production of the I-Pace, which was its first electric car, next year.

However, Gizmodo reports that he said it was a ""skit"" he made with friends, reporting that he ""drove with the headset for 30-40 seconds"".
Apple's user guide warns against using its headset while driving, while Tesla says drivers should always ""maintain control and responsibility for your vehicle,"" even when it is in autonomous mode.
The Apple Vision Pro headset went on sale in the US on 2 February with a $3,499 (£2,749) price tag.  There is no release date for it in the UK.
While users can see through the glass in some modes, it would still severely restrict vision while driving.
The company has tried to stay clear of calling it virtual reality or any other similar name, instead referring to it as ""spatial computing"".
""Don't describe your app experience as augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), extended reality (XR), or mixed reality (MR),"" it said in a blog post targeting developers.
Videos have been posted online of people wearing the headset on the New York subway and at the gym.

2024-02-08T17:11:47.000Z,Microsoft denies it went back on its word on Activision job cuts,BBC News,"Microsoft has denied claims by US regulators that it went back on its word by cutting jobs after its purchase of Activision Blizzard - the biggest gaming deal in history.
Microsoft Gaming announced 1,900 job cuts in January, three months after the $69bn (£56bn) purchase was completed.
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) says that ""contradicts"" Microsoft's previous representations.
But Microsoft said the idea of job cuts did not originate with its takeover.
""Consistent with broader trends in the gaming industry, Activision was already planning on eliminating a significant number of jobs while still operating as an independent company,"" the firm said in a filing with the US court, seen by the BBC.
""The recent announcement thus cannot be attributed fully to the merger.""
The controversial deal gives Microsoft control of popular games such as Call of Duty, World of Warcraft and Candy Crush.
It was initially blocked in the UK but was later approvedwhen Microsoft made concessions.
The FTC, however, is still asking for the Court of Appeals to halt the deal so it can consider anti-trust implications.
If the regulator wins its case, it could still approve the merger but it might decide to split Activision Blizzard up into separate entities, or even block it entirely.
Because of this, it said the layoffs would make it harder for it to reverse the merger if it won its legal case which it said ""underscored the need"" for an injunction now.
The FTC said the reasons given for the layoffs were ""inconsistent"" with previous statements made by Microsoft.
According to the regulator, the tech giant said that it would run Activision Blizzard as an independent company. But the job cuts by Microsoft indicate that the gaming company is not being run independently, said the FTC.
But Microsoft said it ""continues fully to stand behind"" the statements it previously made to the court.
Phil Spencer, chief executive of Microsoft Gaming, had previously said in a memo that the layoffs were a way to reduce ""areas of overlap"" in its business.
Separately, there are reports Microsoft is planning a wider shake-up of its gaming operations, including suggestions Xbox exclusives might end up on rival platforms.
In response, Mr Spencer has announced a ""business update event"" in the coming week to discuss ""the future of Xbox""..

2024-02-05T17:25:57.000Z,Snap to lay off 'approximately' 10% of its staff,BBC News,"Social media giant Snap, which operates Snapchat, has announced plans to cut ""approximately"" 10% of its staff.
The firm said in November 2023 it had 5,000 employees, suggesting around 500 people are facing redundancy.
It comes a day before Snap reports its fourth-quarter results - having reported a net loss of $368m (£294m) in the previous quarter in October 2023.
Snapchat said the move would ""reduce hierarchy and promote in-person collaboration"".
""We are focused on supporting our departing team members and we are very grateful for their hard work and many contributions to Snap,"" a spokesperson told the BBC.
According to its most recent annual report, more than 500 people work for the firm in the UK. It is unclear if any of the cuts will fall in the UK.
Jasmine Enberg, principal social media analyst at Insider Intelligence, told the BBC the layoffs ""don't bode well for the state of Snap's business"" ahead of its latest earnings announcement on Tuesday.
She pointed to rival Meta's latest results - which showed quarterly profits tripling year-on-year, a surge in users, lower costs and higher ad sales - as ""a tough act for Snap to follow"".
""Snap is likely trying to garner some goodwill with investors, who rewarded its competitor for its cost-cutting measures and its continued 'do more with less' mantra going into 2024,"" Ms Enberg said.
She added that Snap's advertising revenues have been ""slow to recover from the digital ad slowdown"".
It is the second wave of mass redundancies from the social media company, which laid off about 20% of its workers in August 2022.
Snap has attempted to expand into products beyond Snapchat, including experimenting with augmented reality (AR) glasses, dubbed Spectacles.
But the firm has been unable to find a mass market for its other products, and it subsequently closed a division that offered AR services to business customers in 2023.
The latest job cuts come as companies, including Meta and Google, have been grappling with how to balance cost-cutting measures with the need to remain competitive.
According to layoffs.fyi, which tracks job losses in the tech sector, there were more than 232,000 job cuts in the industry in 2023.
Elsewhere, last week the firm's chief executive Evan Spiegel was grilled alongside the bosses of X (formerly Twitter), Meta, Discord and TikTok at a US Senate hearing about child safety online, where senators' attention mostly fell on Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg and TikTok boss Shou Zi Chew.
Mr Spiegel said in his opening testimony at the hearing that he and co-founder Bobby Murphy built Snapchat as an alternative to other social media platforms, where images shared were ""permanent, public, and subject to popularity metrics"".
The redundancies were announced by the firm in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
Snap said that the layoffs would affect staff globally, but did not specify who would be affected further.
""In order to best position our business to execute on our highest priorities, and to ensure we have the capacity to invest incrementally to support our growth over time, we have made the difficult decision to restructure our team,"" the firm said.
In its filing, it said the cuts would be ""subject to local law and consultation requirements"" in each country, which could extend the process.
And it estimated the move could cost it between $55m (£44m) and $75m (£60m) in severance payments ""and other charges"".

2024-01-27T18:22:20.000Z,Taylor Swift deepfakes spark calls in Congress for new legislation,BBC News,"US politicians have called for new laws to criminalise the creation of deepfake images, after explicit faked photos of Taylor Swift were viewed millions of times online.
The images were posted on social media sites, including X and Telegram.
US Representative Joe Morelle called the spread of the pictures ""appalling"".
In a statement, X said it was ""actively removing"" the images and taking ""appropriate actions"" against the accounts involved in spreading them.
It added: ""We're closely monitoring the situation to ensure that any further violations are immediately addressed, and the content is removed.""
While many of the images appear to have been removed at the time of publication, one photo of Swift was viewed a reported 47 million times before being taken down.
The name ""Taylor Swift"" is no longer searchable on X, alongside terms such as ""Taylor Swift AI"" and ""Taylor AI"".
Deepfakes use artificial intelligence (AI) to make a video of someone by manipulating their face or body. A study in 2023 found that there has been a 550% rise in the creation of doctored images since 2019, fuelled by the emergence of AI.
There are currently no federal laws against the sharing or creation of deepfake images, though there have been moves at state level to tackle the issue.
In the UK, the sharing of deepfake pornography became illegal as part of its Online Safety Act in 2023.
Democratic Rep Morelle, who last year unveiled the proposed Preventing Deepfakes of Intimate Images Act - which would have made it illegal to share deepfake pornography without consent - called for urgent action on the issue.
He said the images and videos ""can cause irrevocable emotional, financial, and reputational harm - and unfortunately, women are disproportionately impacted"".
Pornography consists of the overwhelming majority of the deepfakes posted online, with women making up 99% of those targeted in such content, according to the State of Deepfakes report published last year.
""What's happened to Taylor Swift is nothing new,"" Democratic Rep Yvette D Clarke posted on X. She noted that women had been targeted by the technology ""for years"", adding that with ""advancements in AI, creating deepfakes is easier & cheaper"".
Republican Congressman Tom Kean Jr agreed, saying that it is ""clear that AI technology is advancing faster than the necessary guardrails"".
""Whether the victim is Taylor Swift or any young person across our country, we need to establish safeguards to combat this alarming trend,"" he added.
Swift has not spoken publicly about the images, but the Daily Mail reported that her team is ""considering legal action"" against the site which published the AI-generated images.
Worries about AI-generated content have increased as billions of people vote in elections this year across the globe.
This week, a fake robocall claiming to be from US President Joe Biden sparked an investigation. It is thought to have been made by AI.

2024-02-03T00:24:36.000Z,Should we fear an attack of the voice clones?,BBC News,"""It's important that you save your vote for the November election,"" the recorded message told prospective voters last month, ahead of a New Hampshire Democratic primary election. It sounded a lot like the President.
But votes don't need to be saved, and the voice was not Joe Biden but likely a convincing AI clone.
The incident has turned fears about AI-powered audio-fakery up to fever pitch - and the technology is getting more powerful, as I learned when I approached a cybersecurity company about the issue.
We set-up a call, which went like this:
""Hey, Chris, this is Rafe Pilling from Secureworks. I'm returning your call about a potential interview. How's it going?""
I said it was going well.
""Great to hear, Chris,"" Mr Pilling said. ""I appreciate you reaching out. I understand you are interested in voice-cloning techniques. Is that correct?""
Yes, I replied. I'm concerned about malicious uses of the technology.
""Absolutely, Chris. I share your concern. Let's find time for the interview,"" he replied.
But this was not the real Mr Pilling. It was a demonstration laid on by Secureworks of an AI system capable of calling me and responding to my reactions. It also had a stab at imitating Mr Pilling's voice.
Listen to the voice-cloned call on the latest episode of Tech Life on BBC Sounds.
""I sound a little bit like a drunk Australian, but that was pretty impressive,"" the actual Mr Pilling said, as the demonstration ended. It wasn't completely convincing. There were pauses before answers that might have screamed ""robot!"" to the wary.
The calls were made using a freely available commercial platform that claims it has the capacity to send ""millions"" of phone calls per day, using human sounding AI agents.
In its marketing it suggests potential uses include call centres and surveys.
Mr Pilling's colleague, Ben Jacob had used the tech as an example - not because the firm behind the product is accused of doing anything wrong. It isn't. But to show the capability of the new generation of systems. And while its strong suit was conversation, not impersonation, another system Mr Jacob demonstrated produced credible copies of voices, based on only small snippets of audio pulled from YouTube.
From a security perspective, Mr Pilling sees the ability of systems to deploy thousands of these kinds of conversational AI's rapidly as a significant, worrying development. Voice cloning is the icing on the cake, he tells me.
Currently phone scammers have to hire armies of cheap labour to run a mini call centre, or just spend a lot of time on the phone themselves. AI could change all that.
If so it would reflect the impact of AI more generally.
""The key thing we're seeing with these AI technologies is the ability to improve the efficiency and scale of existing operations,"" he says.
With major elections in the UK, US and India due this year, there are also concerns audio deepfakes - the name for the kind of sophisticated fake voices AI can create - could be used to generate misinformation aimed at manipulating the democratic outcomes.
Senior British politicians have been subject to audio deepfakes as have politicians in other nations including Slovakia and Argentina. The National Cyber Security centre has explicitly warned of the threats AI fakes pose to the next UK election.
Lorena Martinez who works for a firm working to counter online misinformation, Logically Facts, told the BBC that not only were audio deepfakes becoming more common, they are also more challenging to verify than AI images.
""If someone wants to mask an audio deepfake, they can and there are fewer technology solutions and tools at the disposal of fact-checkers,"" she said.
Mr Pilling adds that by the time the fake is exposed, it has often already been widely circulated.
Ms Martinez, who had a stint at Twitter tackling misinformation, argues that in a year when over half the world's population will head to the polls, social media firms must do more and should strengthen teams fighting disinformation.
She also called on developers of the voice cloning tech to ""think about how their tools could be corrupted"" before they launch them instead of ""reacting to their misuse, which is what we've seen with AI chatbots"".
The Electoral Commission, the UK's election watchdog, told me that emerging uses of AI ""prompt clear concerns about what voters can and cannot trust in what they see, hear and read at the time of elections"".
It says it has teamed up with other watchdogs to try to understand the opportunities and the challenges of AI.
But Sam Jeffers co-founder of Who Targets Me, which monitors political advertising, argues it is important to remember that democratic processes in the UK are pretty robust.
He says we should guard against the danger of too much cynicism too - that deepfakes lead us to disbelieve reputable information.
""We have to be careful to avoid a situation where rather than warning people about dangers of AI, we inadvertently cause people to lose faith in things they can trust,"" Mr Jeffries says.

2024-02-14T13:18:35.000Z,Google joins mission to map methane from space,BBC News,"Tech giant Google is backing a satellite project due to launch in March which will collect data about methane levels around the world.
The new satellite will orbit 300 miles about the Earth, 15 times per day.
Methane gas is believed by scientists to be a major contributor to global warming, because it traps in heat.
A lot of methane is produced by farming and waste disposal, but the Google project will focus on methane emissions at oil and gas plants.
Firms extracting oil and gas regularly burn or vent methane.
The new project is a collaboration between Google and the Environmental Defense Fund, a non-profit global climate group.
The data captured by the satellite will be processed by the tech giant's artificial intelligence tools and used to generate a methane map aimed at identifying methane leaks on oil and gas infrastructure around the world.
But the firm said if it identified a significant leak it would not specifically notify the company which owned the infrastructure responsible for it.
""Our job is to make information available,"" it said, adding that governments and regulators would be among those with access to it and it would be for them to force any changes.""
There is no international rule on controlling methane emissions. The EU has agreed a set of proposals aimed at reducing them, which includes forcing oil and gas operators to repair leaks. In the coal sector, flaring will be banned in member states from 2025.
Google's map, which will be published on its Earth Engine, will not be in real time, with data sent back from the satellite every few weeks.
In 2017, the European Space Agency launched a similar satellite instrument called Tropomi, which charts the presence of trace gases in the atmosphere, including methane.
It was a mission with a minimum seven-year life span, which means it could end this year.
Carbon Mapper, which uses Tropomi data, released a report in 2022 indicating that the biggest methane plumes were seen in Turkmenistan, Russia and the US - but cloud cover meant the data did not include Canada or China.
Google said it hoped its project would ""fill gaps between existing tools"".
Despite various tracking efforts, methane levels remain concerningly high.
Nasa says levels of the gas have more than doubled in the last 200 years, and that 60% of it is created by human activity.
A major contributor to that percentage is livestock: specifically cows. Because of the way they digest their food, cow burps and farts contain methane.
In 2020 the US Environmental Protection Agency published a report that said a single cow could produce 154-264 pounds of methane gas every year. It added that there were believed to be about 1.5 billion cows raised for their meat worldwide.
""Satellites are great for finding the really big, massive culprits"" of methane emissions, said Peter Thorne, professor of physical geography at Maynooth University in Ireland.
But detecting more diffuse methane sources, such as those emanating from agriculture, is more difficult, he added.

In addition to cuts in the US and Japan, the gaming giant said this would mean closing PlayStation's London Studio entirely.
In a blog post sharing an email sent to employees, boss Jim Ryan called the move ""sad news"" and said it was ""a difficult day at our company"".
""We have concluded that tough decisions have become inevitable,"" he said.
""The leadership team and I made the incredibly difficult decision to restructure operations, which regrettably includes a reduction in our workforce impacting very talented individuals who have contributed to our success.""
The cuts come a month after rival Microsoft revealed plans to lay off 1,900 people in its gaming division, which included those at recently-acquired Activision-Blizzard.
""Sony is one of the big pillars of UK game development culture so it's massive to see the legendary Sony London studio close in particular,"" said Halli Bjornsson, head of UK developer Lockwood Publishing.
""It's a challenging time for our industry as it continues to go through major changes.
""However, UK games talent and heritage is world class, and if we continue to foster it, we'll rebound and be in a good place to build upon the opportunities that are on the horizon.""
Sony's London Studio was founded in 2002 as a result of the merging of two other London-based studios under the PlayStation brand.
Over the past two decades, it created several series including karaoke game SingStar and 2000s football title This Is Football.
More recently, it made virtual reality (VR) games exclusive to Sony's headset, including VR Worlds and the well-received shooter Blood & Truth.
According to LinkedIn, the studio has between 51 and 200 employees, and it was working on ""an unannounced online co-op combat game"" set in London before the announcement.
Sony's PlayStation 5 has sold more than 50 million units worldwide, more than double Microsoft's Xbox Series X/S sales.
But another gaming rival, Nintendo, which released its Switch console three years earlier, has sold almost 140 million units worldwide.
And Sony said in its earnings report in February that it now expected to sell four million fewer consoles than expected by the end of March.
Despite PlayStation's revenue being up by 16% compared to the same period one year earlier, its operating income had fallen by a quarter.
""Sony Interactive Entertainment becomes the latest in a long list of games companies that have laid off a significant number of staff in the last 12-18 months,"" said Piers Harding-Rolls, gaming industry analyst at Ampere Analysis.
""The cost of developing big-budget games has reached unsustainable levels and these costs have come when the games sector is going through an adjustment post-pandemic.

2024-02-15T17:24:43.000Z,Facebook £3bn legal action given go-ahead in London,BBC News,"A judge has given the go-ahead to a mass legal action against Facebook owner Meta, potentially worth £3bn.
The case is being brought by legal academic Dr Liza Lovdahl Gormsen, on behalf of 45 million Facebook users.
Her original claim was refused, in 2023, but a revised version has now been accepted, with early 2026 said to be the latest it could be heard.
Meta said the claims ""remain entirely without merit and we will vigorously defend against them"".
The new claim says: ""Facebook has struck an unfair bargain with its users,"" according to legal documents.
Facebook abused its dominance by making users give it their data from non-Facebook products, including Meta-owned Instagram and other third-party sites.
And sharing data with third parties had become ""a condition of accessing the Facebook platform, pursuant to a 'take-it-or-leave-it' offer"".
Facebook is free to use but carries advertisements.
The more data it has on its users, the better it can target adverts - and the more it can charge.
The claim is seeking £2.07-3.1bn compensation for those who had Facebook accounts between February 2016 and October 2023.
It will be heard at the Competition Appeal Tribunal.
Meta said the ""fundamental concerns identified by the tribunal in its February 2023 judgement have not been resolved"".
It was ""committed to giving people meaningful control"" of the information they shared on its platforms and to ""invest heavily to create tools that allow them to do so.""
The legal action is being funded by Innsworth, a company backed by an investment management fund, which has also funded mass legal actions against Mastercard, Ericsson and Volkswagen.
In 2023, Meta paid out $725m (£583m), in a privacy case, to Facebook account holders in the US.

Despite the technique's popularity, experts have long warned against it, with tests suggesting it doesn't work.
And now the tech giant itself has published guidance telling users it could result in small particles of the grain damaging their devices.
The firm said people should instead gently tap out any liquid, with the phone connector facing down, then leave it to dry out.
Despite the increasing sophistication of smartphones, popular approaches for fixing them if they have been dropped in water remain rather unsophisticated.
Apple has taken the opportunity to steer users away from several of them.
As well as avoiding bags of rice, it also advises against drying a wet phone using an ""external heat source or compressed air"", meaning radiators and hairdryers should be avoided.
Nor, it suggests, should users try inserting ""a foreign object, such as a cotton swab or a paper towel"" into their phone.
Instead, it guides people to leave their phone in a ""dry area with some airflow"" before reconnecting it to a charger.
As the website MacWorld - which first spotted the new support document - notes, the changing design of smartphones may mean all such advice will be unnecessary in the future.
That is because devices are increasingly able to withstand getting wet.
All Apple devices from the iPhone 12 onwards are able to withstand immersion up to a depth of six metres, for up to half an hour.
But with cost-of-living pressures driving growth in the global second-hand mobile market, it is likely that many people will need advice on what to do - and what not to - with a soggy smartphone for some time yet.

The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) says Serco Leisure has been unlawfully processing the biometric data of more than 2,000 employees at 38 UK leisure facilities.
It did so to check staff attendance - a practice the ICO said was ""neither fair nor proportionate"".
Serco Leisure says it will comply with the enforcement notice.
But it added it had taken legal advice prior to installing the cameras, and said staff had not complained about them during the five years they had been in place.
The firm said it was to ""make clocking-in and out easier and simpler"" for workers.
""We engaged with our team members in advance of its roll-out and its introduction was well-received by colleagues,"" the company said in a statement.
The ICO said the company's staff - who also have their fingerprints scanned - had not been offered a clear alternative to the gathering of their biometric data.
It also found the firm had failed to show why the practice was necessary when there were less intrusive ways of monitoring staff attendance, such as ID cards or fobs.
John Edwards, the UK Information Commissioner, said Serco Leisure had increased the ""power imbalance in the workplace"", and left employees feeling like they had no choice but to hand over their biometric data.
""Serco Leisure did not fully consider the risks before introducing biometric technology to monitor staff attendance, prioritising business interests over its employees' privacy,"" he said.
""Biometric data is wholly unique to a person so the risks of harm in the event of inaccuracies or a security breach are much greater - you can't reset someone's face or fingerprint like you can reset a password.,"" he added.
The ICO announced it was publishing new guidance for all organisations that are considering using employees' biometric data, showing them how to comply with data protection law.
The technology is deeply controversial, with privacy campaigners saying it infringes people's rights, especially as artificial intelligence makes the systems more powerful.
However, law enforcement and some businesses say it is a precise and efficient way of keeping people safe and catching criminals.

The Lucy Faithfull Foundation (LFF) says AI images are acting as a gateway.
The charity is warning that creating or viewing such images is still illegal even if the children are not real.
Neil, not his real name, contacted the helpline after being arrested for creating AI images.
The 43-year-old denied that he had any sexual attraction to children.
The IT worker, who used AI software to make his own indecent images of children using text prompts, said he would never view such images of real children because he is not attracted to them. He claimed simply to be fascinated by the technology.
He called the LFF to try to understand his thoughts, and call handlers reminded him that his actions are illegal, regardless of whether or not the children are real.
The charity says it has had similar calls from others who are expressing confusion.
Another caller got in touch after discovering that her 26-year-old partner viewed indecent AI images of children, but said they were not serious because the pictures ""aren't real"". The offender has since asked for help.
A teacher asked for the charity's advice because her 37-year-old partner was viewing images that seemed illegal, but neither of them was sure if they were.
The LFF's Donald Findlater says some callers to its confidential Stop It Now helpline think that AI images are blurring the boundaries for what is illegal and morally wrong.
""This is a dangerous view. Some offenders think this material is in some way OK to create or view because there are no children being harmed, but this is wrong,"" he says.
In some cases, AI abuse images might also be wrongly labelled or advertised as AI-made and the difference in realism is becoming harder to spot.
Mr Findlater says that deviant sexual fantasy is the strongest predictor of reoffending for anyone convicted of a sexual crime.
""If you feed that deviant fantasy, then you're making it more likely you're going to do harm to children,"" he said.
The charity says the number of callers citing AI images as a reason for their offending remains low, but is rising. The foundation is urging society to recognise the problem and lawmakers to do something to reduce the ease in which child sexual abuse material (CSAM) is made and published online.
Although the charity would not name any specific sites where it has found the imagery, one popular AI art website has been accused of allowing users to publish sexual and graphic images of very young models. When the BBC approached Civit.ai about the issue in November, the firm said it takes potential CSAM on the site ""very seriously"" and asks the community to report images that users consider to ""depict under-age characters/people in a mature or photorealistic context"".
The LFF also warned that young people are creating CSAM without realising the seriousness of the offence. One caller, for example, was concerned about his 12-year-old son who had used an AI app to create inappropriate topless pictures of friends, and then subsequently searched for terms such as ""naked teen"" online.
Criminal cases in Spain and the US have recently been launched against young boys using declothing apps to create naked pictures of school friends.
In the UK, Graeme Biggar, head of the National Crime Agency, said in December that he wanted to see tougher sentences for offenders who possess child abuse imagery, adding that AI abuse imagery ""matters, because we assess that the viewing of these images - whether real or AI-generated - materially increases the risk of offenders moving on to sexually abusing children themselves"".
Some contributors have asked for their names to be withheld in this piece.

The star has previously made his material available to his 231 million subscribers on YouTube.
MrBeast said he is now trying X because he is ""super curious"" how much advertising revenue it will make.
His U-turn is a boost for the struggling social media platform.
Owner Elon Musk has tried various strategies to boost the business - previously known as Twitter - since buying it in October 2022.
These include sharing advertising revenue with high profile creators, something that other sites, including YouTube, already do.
The amount so-called influencers can make varies from person to person. The terms of individual deals are kept confidential though it is thought the biggest names may be able to negotiate special rates.
MrBeast, real name Jimmy Donaldson, said he would publicly reveal the money he made from the X video, which picked up 33 million views in just 10 hours, in a week's time.
However, it has some way to go to beat the total audience it gained on the previous platform, where it has been viewed 211 million times since it was posted in September 2023.
Regardless, it amounts to a significant change of heart for MrBeast, who previously said it was not worth his time to post videos to X, as ""even if they got a billion views"" it wouldn't cover the cost.
MrBeast has claimed that his YouTube videos cost millions of dollars to make. But he has also earned a fortune. In November 2022, Forbes estimated that he made $54m (£42.5m) in a year from YouTube.
Since then, he has gained 120 million more subscribers on his main channel.
Those kinds of figures mean it is a boon for X to host MrBeast's content.
But there is no guarantee he will replicate his success on YouTube, as demonstrated by the recent deal struck by US celebrity Paris Hilton, which was pulled after just four weeks.
""I think he's doing this to prove the point that you can't make any real money as a video creator on Twitter,"" said Dave Wiskus, CEO of indie streaming service Nebula.
""We can talk about who owns Twitter, who advertises on Twitter, and what the ethical implications are of engaging with it at all, but I don't get the sense that what he's doing is designed to make Twitter look good.
""This isn't an endorsement; I think he's using his visibility to try to improve things.""
The amount of advertising revenue creators can make may also be affected by Mr Musk's feud with advertisers, some of whom he has a rocky relationship with. Last year, he swore at the Disney chief executive, Bob Iger, during a live event after the entertainment giant pulled its advertising from X.
X has also been marred by accusations that it is allowing hate speech on the platform - which it vociferously denies - and unlike some of the celebrities Mr Musk has previously endorsed on X, MrBeast has a wholesome image.
He is known for his charity work and giving away money, while Kris, a member of his production team who regularly appears in videos, came out as trans in 2023.
But ultimately it isn't just big brands that bankroll social networks, which tend to spend well but sporadically on high profile campaigns. For every big name there needs to be millions of small and medium businesses, spending little and often, to keep a platform afloat.
If the experiment is to be a success, from X's point of view, the question will be how many of those MrBeast draws in.

He says it is focusing on generating profits for partner and major investor Microsoft instead.
But OpenAI says Mr Musk previously backed the idea of a for-profit structure and even suggested a merger with his car firm Tesla.
In a blog post on its website, OpenAI also claims Mr Musk at one point wanted ""absolute control"" of the company, before eventually leaving it in 2018.
It says it intends to move to dismiss claims in Mr Musk's recently filed lawsuit.
OpenAI also published a trove of Mr Musk's emails to his fellow co-founders to dispute some of his claims.
BBC News has approached Mr Musk for comment. But he has already responded to the blog post on X, formerly Twitter.
""Change your name,"" he wrote.
Mr Musk's lawsuit, filed in a San Francisco court on Thursday 29 February, claimed that OpenAI breached principles he agreed to when helping co-found the company in 2015.
It also took aim at Microsoft.
Microsoft has invested billions of dollars in the AI firm since it established a for-profit arm in 2019, which allowed it to raise money.
His lawyers argued in court filings the firm had since become a ""closed-source de facto subsidiary of the largest technology company in the world"".
""We're sad that it's come to this with someone whom we've deeply admired - someone who inspired us to aim higher, then told us we would fail, started a competitor, and then sued us when we started making meaningful progress towards OpenAI's mission without him,"" OpenAI said in its blog.
It was written by fellow co-founders and executives including chief executive Sam Altman, Greg Brockman and former chief scientist Ilya Sutskever.
Mr Musk's lawsuit had targeted both Mr Altman and Mr Brockman, alongside the firm itself.
The blog goes into detail to dispute a number of claims made in the lawsuit.
It says that in early 2018 Mr Musk had forwarded an email saying OpenAI should join up with his electric car company, Tesla, to use it as its ""cash cow"".
""As we discussed a for-profit structure in order to further the mission, Elon wanted us to merge with Tesla or he wanted full control,"" the blog post adds.

2024-03-05T21:20:29.000Z,"Bitcoin price briefly tops $69,000 for new all-time high",BBC News,"The price of the world's largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, briefly hit a new all-time high of more than $69,000.
It surpassed the previous record set in November 2021 - though by 2022 Bitcoin's value had sunk to $16,500.
The new surge in price has been spurred by US finance giants pouring billions into buying bitcoins.
The cryptocurrency rose to around $69,200 shortly after 15:00 GMT on Tuesday, before falling back. It was trading around $62,185 by 21:00 GMT.
Bitcoin's value has spiked by more than 50% over the last month, according to cryptocurrency market data platform CoinMarketCap.
Carol Alexander, professor of finance at Sussex University, said its price could go higher than its new record but warned that crypto was ""notoriously volatile.""
""Too often in the past the price crash was timed so that ordinary investors buying Bitcoin during the bubble are the ones who lose out,"" she told the BBC.
The new record represents another dramatic moment in Bitcoin's turbulent history.
It was invented in 2009 by a person or persons calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto - their true identity remains a mystery.
Conceived as a means to create money for the internet, its roots lay in an anti-establishment ethos encouraging people to live free from the existing power structure of financial institutions and governments.
However, its new all-time high value has come about precisely because those establishment firms have been pouring billions of dollars into acquiring it.
That has been made possible because, in January 2024, US regulators reluctantly approved several spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs).
That allowed giant investment firms like Blackrock, Fidelity and Grayscale to sell products based on the price of Bitcoin.
Between them, they have been buying hundreds of thousands of bitcoins, rapidly driving up their value.
Prof Alexander told the BBC these entrants ""are attracting institutional investors into Bitcoin and they are putting a considerable upwards pressure on price.""
But she added Bitcoin's ""halving"" event, expected to take place in April, may also influence the cryptocurrency's value.
""In the past, these events have been accompanied by price surges,"" she said.
For many holders of Bitcoin, this will be a moment to celebrate - as their own wealth will have risen a great deal.
But history suggests they should be prepared for that to change.
Bitcoin's value tumbled to 18-month lows of nearly $20,000 in June 2022 as investors sought to cut ties with riskier investments amid a gloomy global economic outlook.
The cryptocurrency's price slumped further later that year when FTX - the huge cryptocurrency exchange founded by so-called ""king of crypto"" Sam Bankman-Fried - collapsed into bankruptcy in November 2022.
Its peaks and troughs continued throughout 2023, but it managed to climb back up to trade above $40,000 towards the end of the year.
It is not just companies and individual investors who have been tracking those fluctuations closely.
In Central America, El Salvador's president Nayib Bukele has embraced the cryptocurrency.
The Bitcoin-loving leader has spent more than $100m of his developing nation's public money on buying almost 3000 bitcoins over the last few years.
His investment is now worth around 60% more than he paid for it. Although no public records have been released on the specifics.

2024-02-29T19:49:55.000Z,Plan to double power of e-bikes sparks fire fears,BBC News,"A government plan to double the maximum legal power of e-bikes has drawn warnings that it could increase the risk of severe battery fires and other injuries.
The Department for Transport is consulting on the proposals which would also allow e-bikes that don't require pedalling to travel much faster.
The government said it wanted to make riding e-bikes more attractive.
But critics said the plans posed safety risks.
There were more fires caused by e-bikes and e-scooters in London in 2023 than in any previous year.
London Fire Brigade said it supported green transport but described lithium battery fires as ""London's fastest growing fire trend.""
""The risk of more severe battery fires - because of these more powerful models - which the consultation does highlight, is a significant concern"", said Assistant Commissioner for Fire Safety, Charlie Pugsley.
Campaign group Electrical Safety First said: ""Substandard e-bike batteries are already causing devastating fires across the country.""
MPs should focus on making current batteries safe, it said.
Currently the motors of e-bikes - or electrically assisted pedal cycles (EAPCs) as they are officially known - must not exceed 250 watts.
The government wants to increase that to 500 watts in England, Scotland and Wales.
It is also consulting on increasing the top speed that users on e-bikes with throttles can travel, to 15.5mph up from 3.73mph at the moment.
In its consultation document, the government acknowledged that higher speeds and more power could increase road risks, including collisions.
It said it could also make battery fires more severe, with risks heightened by tampering.
However, it said having greater power might also reduce the incentive for people to tamper with their bikes - one of the issues contributing to safety problems with e-bikes at the moment.
The government said boosting e-bike power might also encourage more delivery bikes, cutting congestion and air pollution, while making rides easier and more enticing to users.
But Volt, which makes e-bikes, said the plan to boost the power would ""attract unsafe batteries and potentially encourage users to tamper with them"".
Volt managing director James Metcalfe said lawmakers were ""failing to understand what our industry truly needs"".
""It is our infrastructure that is lagging behind, not the technology in e-bikes,"" he said. ""Ministers need to take action to build more cycle lanes and increase incentives for sustainable transport.""
Campaign group Cycling UK said the main reason more people don't cycle was that they don't feel safe on the roads.
It warned that the proposals presented ""a huge safety risk to pedestrians and others who cycle"".
""The dramatically increased power would mean faster acceleration and much heavier bikes, which we're really concerned about,"" said Cycling UK's director of external affairs, Sarah McMonagle.
She said the government should invest in better cycling infrastructure, and give financial assistance to people who need it for bikes.
Three people died in London last year in fires thought to have been caused by e-bike lithium batteries.
The risk of e-bike fires has been in the spotlight in recent weeks, with one delivery rider telling the BBC that, due to the high price of reliable e-bikes, people will buy ""cheaper, less reliable and often dangerous batteries"".
The Bicycle Association, which represents the UK cycle industry, said it was concerned the proposals could legitimise the process of tampering with e-bikes to boost their power - with a higher potential power leading to ""possibly very serious fire safety consequences"".
It said it also feared the changes could lead to calls for ""moped-like"" regulations for the sector - such as mandatory insurance, registration and helmets - which could make e-bikes ""significantly less attractive"" to people.
The government said it would use any feedback it received through consultation responses to consider how to mitigate risks.
A government spokesperson said:  ""We're launching this consultation to gather views on how we can increase power safely for certain users, including those with mobility issues and e-cargo bike operators. Safety is always at the heart of any decisions made around e-bikes and the results of the consultation will be published followings its closure.""
The consultation will end on 25 April 2024.

2024-01-11T00:21:51.000Z,Pornography review to canvass public's view on issue,BBC News,"The public, adult performers and law enforcement are being invited to answer a questionnaire on the impact of pornography.
It will be used in a review of the industry that will make recommendations to government.
Questions will include the effect of porn on relationships, mental health and attitudes towards women and girls.
But a trade association for the adult industry has said it seemed a ""pretext for greater censorship"".
The review will also look at how AI and virtual reality are changing how pornography is made and consumed.
There is concern about the ability of AI to generate child abuse images, and non-consensual pornographic images.
In December the government announced that Conservative peer Baroness Bertin, who used to work at 10 Downing Street, would lead an ""independent"" pornography review.
The study would examine abuse, exploitation and trafficking in the pornography industry, its impact on viewers, and ways to bolster law enforcement to help tackle illegal pornographic content.
Measures to stop children accessing pornography online by requiring services to establish the age of their users, including through age verification and age estimation tools, are already included in the new Online Safety Act.
But Baroness Bertin said the review would help ""future proof the law"" as technology evolved.
""Extreme pornography can have a damaging impact - we owe it to our children and indeed to the whole of society to put the guard rails back in place,"" she said.
The Free Speech Coalition, a trade association for the adult industry, said it hoped the government was ""honest in its invitation to involve the adult industry in this discussion"".
""Despite the sometimes fevered headlines and political speeches, we are a legal, ethical industry with families ourselves, one that prioritises consent and safety, and wants to keep minors from accessing our content as much as others do,"" a spokesperson said.
The organisation told the BBC it was ""wary"" of the review which it said ""frames sexual expression as a threat and a societal harm"".
It said while the review seemed a pretext for censorship, it would ""proceed in good faith and help work to dispel myths and find workable solutions"".
Myles Jackman an obscenity lawyer, academic, and activist said it was disappointing that ""the review is framed in such presumptive and negative terms; rather than focusing on children's sexual relationship educational needs"".
The questionnaire follows the release of figures showing a rise in sexual offenses committed by children, which Police blamed on a combination of mobile phone ownership and the availability of hardcore pornography.
Rick Muir from the Police Foundation think tank welcomed the review: ""Anything that can be done to tackle harmful sexual behaviours is positive and from a policing point of view should in the long term help to reduce crime.""
But Professor Sonia Livingstone of the LSE queried the lack of emphasis on academic research and said the review should look at the evidence researchers had already collated: ""I hope they read it"", she told the BBC.
She added that the Online Safety Act ""should be a game changer in keeping children safe online in the UK. It's not clear what is being proposed here that's new"".
It would also be important to look at business models that lead pornography firms to use algorithms that pushed ever more extreme content, including to those who may be particularly vulnerable, Prof Livingstone argued.
The review is expected to report back later in 2024.

2024-02-26T13:35:14.000Z,Instagram owner Meta forms team to stop AI from tricking voters,BBC News,"Facebook and Instagram owner Meta says it will form a team to tackle deceptive artificial intelligence (AI) content in the upcoming EU elections in June.
It is concerned by how generative AI - tech which can fake videos, images and audio - might be used to trick voters.
It comes on the same day Home Secretary James Cleverly told the Times some people will use AI-generated fakes to try to influence a general election.
But an industry expert said the plans could be seen as ""lacking teeth"".
The BBC has asked Meta if it has such plans for upcoming UK and US elections.
The announcement comes two weeks after Meta signed an agreement with other big tech firms committing to fighting such content.
The European Parliament vote will be held from 6 to 9 June this year.
Social media rival TikTok announced in February it would be launching so-called ""Election Centres"" in local languages within its app for each of the 27 EU members, which will host authoritative information.
Meta head of EU affairs Marco Pancini said in a blog post that the firm, which also owns WhatsApp and Threads, would launch ""an EU-specific Elections Operations Centre"" that would ""identify potential threats and put specific mitigations in place across our apps and technologies in real time"".
""Since 2016, we've invested more than $20bn (£15.7bn) into safety and security and quadrupled the size of our global team working in this area to around 40,000 people,"" he said.
""This includes 15,000 content reviewers who review content across Facebook, Instagram and Threads in more than 70 languages - including all 24 official EU languages.""
He said this meant bringing together experts from a range of different teams across the company, including those working in engineering, data science and law.
But the announcement has shortcomings, according to Deepak Padmanabhan from Queen's University Belfast, who has co-authored a paper on elections and AI.
""Most of its planned strategy could be observed to lack teeth in substantive ways,"" he said.
One of the issues he has with Meta's strategy is how the firm plans to deal with AI-generated images, which he said ""could be intrinsically unworkable"".
He asked what would happen in a situation where realistic AI-generated images appear to show protesters clashing with police.
""Proving it to be fake requires that we are sure that there was no such attack by the policemen pictured on the farmers pictured - this may be infeasible both for technology or for human experts,"" he said.
""How can any technology label this as fake or real?
""Thus, it is not very clear as to how effective Meta's generative AI strategy could be - at the very least, there are serious limitations.""
Meta, which currently works with 26 fact-checking organisations across the EU, said it would bring on board three more partners based in Bulgaria, France and Slovakia to help deal with the threat.
The role of these organisations is not to deal with content which is intended to suppress voting - these kinds of posts are banned - but rather to debunk content that is spreading misinformation, including when they involve AI-generated elements.
Mr Pancini said these types of posts would be given warning labels and made less prominent, as well as not being allowed in ads.
Ads cannot question the legitimacy of the vote, prematurely claim victory, or question ""the methods and processes of election"".
But he said the firm's work was a result of collaboration, and it would require further co-ordination in the future.
""Since AI-generated content appears across the internet, we've also been working with other companies in our industry on common standards and guidelines,"" he said.
""This work is bigger than any one company and will require a huge effort across industry, government, and civil society.""

2024-03-07T00:07:03.000Z,Police worried 101 call bot would struggle with 'Brummie' accents,BBC News,"West Midlands Police trialled a voice assistant powered by artificial intelligence (AI) in a bid to deal with rising volumes of non-emergency calls.
Sensitive technical details of the plan were erroneously published online in a document seen by the BBC.
It set out potential risks of the AI, including whether the system, dubbed ""Amy101"", would understand local ""Brummie"" accents.
West Midlands Police has insisted ""robust safeguards"" were in place.
Based on the tech behind Amazon's popular voice assistant, Alexa, the trial explored how AI could help the force cope with increasing volumes of calls, and potentially offer new services such as responses in different languages.
A document detailing the plan was mistakenly posted online by the office of the West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC). The document, marked ""official sensitive"" and with warnings that it was ""not to be publicly disclosed"", has since been removed.
Amy101 was designed to speak or text-chat in order to deal with callers' inquiries and was expected to handle about 200 calls per day.
The project, a two month proof-of-concept trial, was nationally funded.
It was - the document suggested - the first such project where an AI-powered tool would speak to callers, though other forces were also exploring uses of the tech.
Amy101 had the ability to prioritise vulnerable callers, by looking out for certain keywords - such as those referencing domestic violence - and ensuring they were next-in-line to be dealt with by a human call operator, the document says.
Through speech or text chat it could direct calls, provide advice on issues such as reporting criminal damage, or requesting a crime update.
West Midlands Police told the BBC the trial began on 19 December 2023 and had now concluded.
Its director of commercial services, Peter Gillett, said - by the time the trial started - the force had already improved and was now ""one of the top-performing police forces for managing emergency and non-emergency calls"".
The document - prepared for an ethical oversight committee that advises the PCC and Chief Constable - reveals the potential problems that might arise with Amy101, including whether the tech could cope with the local accent.
""Bias will naturally occur within the ""Amy"" system based on accents/localisation - for example can she understand ""Brummie"" accents? And are they treated with equal weighting to different accents in English?"" the document asks.
Because Alexa is used globally - coping with a range of accents and languages - it was hoped that this type of bias had been removed. And if calls were not understood they would be transferred to the queue for a human operator.
Mr Gillett said the force recognised that technologies capable of understanding ordinary language were ""not flawless"", and therefore may struggle with accents.
As a result the force used a ""large-scale"" system ""to mitigate this bias"".
Potential issues around safeguarding data were also flagged, including the risk calls would be used to help train the Amazon AI system, called Lex V2, behind Amy101.
Some calls could include personally identifiable information. The document provides the example, ""My name is Marc and I want to report my house was broken into….."".
The police can, however, opt-out of this kind of training and will do this ""where viable"", the document says.
The ethics committee also had a number of questions, recorded in its minutes, about Amy101, such as the voice and ""gendered name"" of the tool. The force responded arguing ""humanisation"" was needed.
It also suggested officers requested further analysis from Amazon on potential issues ""such as regional accent recognition and bias testing"".
It is not clear whether the concerns raised in the document ever materialised, though police struck a positive note about the outcome of the trial:
""AI (Artificial Intelligence) does present some potential opportunities for providing a more efficient and robust service"", Mr Gillett said.
Now the ""proof-of-concept"" trial is over, the force would be ""sharing the results and outcomes at a national scale"", he added.
According to the document the government was also interested in the trial - it said a Home Office team was ""keeping a close eye"" on it with a view to wider uses.

2024-01-23T13:27:32.000Z,US regulator admits cyber-security lapse before rogue Bitcoin post,BBC News,"The US financial regulator has confirmed a key security procedure on its X account had been suspended for six months when hackers made a fake post about Bitcoin in January.
The cryptocurrency surged in value before the post was deleted.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) did not have multi-factor authentication (MFA) in place when hackers gained access to the account.
Cyber-security experts say it should be a wake-up call for other agencies.
""While the SEC's X account hack is a minor security incident, all governmental agencies should review the security of their social network accounts,"" said Ilia Kolochenko from cyber-firm ImmuniWeb.
He pointed out that a similar incident at a body such as the US Department of Defense could have more ""devastating consequences"".
""While MFA had previously been enabled on the @SECGov X account, it was disabled by X Support, at the staff's request, in July 2023 due to issues accessing the account,"" the SEC said in a statement.
""Once access was re-established, MFA remained disabled until staff re-enabled it after the account was compromised on January 9.
""MFA currently is enabled for all SEC social media accounts that offer it.""
The SEC has confirmed the account was compromised by a fraudster convincing a mobile operator to transfer an SEC employee's phone number to a new Sim.
The employee who was targeted had their phone number associated with the SEC's account for X, formerly known as Twitter.
Because MFA had been suspended on the account, the hacker was able to reset the password, log in and make a post.
It announced the SEC had approved so-called exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for Bitcoin, which shot up in value to $48,000 (£37,800) before the post was withdrawn.
Though the SEC has subsequently confirmed the regulatory change, the cryptocurrency fell to just over $38,600 on Tuesday, its lowest value in 2024 so far.
In a Sim-swapping attack, typically a hacker will call a mobile phone operator claiming they have lost the phone they are targeting and need a new Sim card sent out to them.
Sometimes, the hackers will go into a store in person to carry out the con.
MFA is intended to protect against this kind of hack.
It takes many forms, including having a dedicated app that gives you a pin code for a website, as well as sending a text message, though this is considered less secure.
If the verification a person chooses is to receive a text confirming they are the user, a person who has gained access to their phone number will receive the text message instead.
Because of this, experts advise people to use a dedicated app for verification instead.

2024-03-01T14:26:40.000Z,Elon Musk sues ChatGPT-maker OpenAI over Microsoft links,BBC News,"Elon Musk is suing OpenAI, the makers of ChatGPT, arguing it has breached the principles he agreed to when he helped found it in 2015.
The lawsuit - which has also been filed against OpenAI boss Sam Altman - says the firm has departed from its original non-profit, open source mission.
It says instead of trying to ""benefit humanity"" - as it was set up to do - it is focusing on ""maximising profits"" for major investor Microsoft.
OpenAI has been approached for comment.
The firm was created with the intention of building what's known as artificial general intelligence (AGI) - AI that can perform any task a human being is capable of.
It was also set up as a not-for-profit company, meaning it would not aim to make money.
The lawsuit, which has been filed in San Francisco, states it was under these conditions, that Mr Musk agreed to found OpenAI, along with Mr Altman and co-founder Greg Brockman.
He left three years later.
""This case is filed to compel OpenAI to adhere to the Founding Agreement and return to its mission to develop AGI for the benefit of humanity, not to personally benefit the individual Defendants and the largest technology company in the world,"" the lawsuit says.
The filing comes after the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday that US regulators had begun to probe the ChatGPT creator over whether investors had been misled, following boardroom drama at OpenAI in November 2023.
It saw Mr Altman suddenly ousted from the board, before being reinstated at the helm several days later.
The board at the time accused Mr Altman of not being ""consistently candid in his communications"", and said as a result they had ""lost confidence"" in his leadership.
It was a row Microsoft became deeply embroiled in - including an offer to take on any staff who quit OpenAI.
Mr Musk had said in a post on X - formerly Twitter - that he was ""very worried"" by the situation.
His lawyers now say in this lawsuit that these ""stunning developments"" highlight Microsoft's increased influence over the company.
""Its technology, including GPT-4, is closed-source primarily to serve the proprietary commercial interests of Microsoft,"" it says.
Microsoft's initial $1bn backing of OpenAI in 2019 came shortly after the AI firm - previously operating as a non-profit - announced a new ""capped profit"" structure which would allow investment in it.
Microsoft's investment swelled to a multi-year, multi-billion partnership in January 2023 following the launch of OpenAI's chatbot, ChatGPT.
The partnership is now being examined by UK, EU and US regulators.
To understand some of the context behind this, it's useful to know a little about a philosophy several tech billionaires including Elon Musk are said to be fond of: it's called effective altruism.
It has very lofty ambitions around identifying the world's most pressing problems and trying to solve them (this is a very basic explanation - but you can see why it helps if you're a billionaire). It's not about personal or indeed commercial gain.
If OpenAI was founded with that principle at its core, you can see why Mr Musk, and indeed some of the firm's senior figures, were disgruntled when a few years later it launched a profit-arm.
Indeed there were some whispers around the time that Sam Altman was dramatically fired that the board was concerned about the growing power of the profit-making division.
If this does ever come to court, it could be an epic battle of two tech titans, neither of whom particularly needs a financial win.
It could become a fight between ideology and the real world, or ultimately a battle for supremacy between two men who have extraordinary global influence.
I'm getting the popcorn ready…
The lawsuit also alleges that details about the design of OpenAI's most recent AI model, GPT-4, were kept secret.
""On information and belief, this secrecy is primarily driven by commercial considerations, not safety,"" it says.
Mr Musk announced his own AI start-up called xAI in July 2023, citing its mission as being to ""understand reality"".
It developed Grok, its own chatbot with ""a little humour"", to try and rival the likes of ChatGPT in November that year.
Mr Musk's lawyers say, among other desired outcomes of the lawsuit, they want OpenAI to be ordered to continue making information relating to its AI developments available to the public.
Microsoft declined to comment.

2024-01-08T13:06:27.000Z,Apple pays out over claims it deliberately slowed down iPhones,BBC News,"Apple has begun making payments in a long-running class action lawsuit over claims it deliberately slowed down certain iPhones in the US.
Complainants will receive a cut of a $500m (£394m) settlement which works out to around $92 (£72) per claim.
Apple agreed to settle the lawsuit in 2020, stating at the time it denied any wrongdoing but was concerned with the cost of continuing litigation.
A similar case under way in the UK is seeking £1.6bn in compensation.
The US case dates back to December 2017, when Apple confirmed a long-held suspicion among phone owners by admitting it had deliberately slowed down some iPhones as they got older.
It said that as batteries aged, their performance decreased, and so the ""slowdown"" lengthened the phones' lifespan.
But it was accused of throttling the performance of certain iPhones without telling its customers, and the uproar resulted in Apple offering a cut-price battery replacement to fix the problem.
It led to the US legal action. At the time of the settlement, it was estimated that each person might receive as little as $25 each but the actual pay-out appears to be almost four times that sum.
In the UK, Apple lost a bid to block a similar mass action lawsuit last November.
The case, first brought by Justin Gutmann in June 2022, represents an estimated 24 million iPhone users.
Apple has previously called the lawsuit ""baseless"" and said ""we have never - and would never - do anything to intentionally shorten the life of any Apple product, or degrade the user experience to drive customer upgrades"".
Mr Gutmann told the BBC he was pleased to hear about payments being made in the US, but warned it does not have any bearing on the UK case.
""It doesn't advance our position here, they haven't admitted anything - they've settled,"" he said.
""It's a moral victory but not much use to me. I've got to plough on and pursue the case in the UK jurisdiction.""
He said Apple was ""fighting tooth and nail"" against the UK class action, which will next appear at the Court of Appeal who will consider a call from the firm to halt the case.
He said it was difficult to put a timeline on what would come next but hopes it will go to trial in late 2024 or early 2025.

2024-01-05T17:14:47.000Z,Logan Paul offers partial refund for failed CryptoZoo game,BBC News,"Logan Paul has begun the process of buying back NFTs from fans who lost money in his failed cryptocurrency game.
The YouTube star announced the game CryptoZoo in 2021 but it never materialised, despite fans spending millions on game tokens.
Paul, 28, has now said he will buy back the NFTs, on the condition that fans who accept do not sue him.
It is unlikely that fans will get all of their money back.
CryptoZoo was meant to be a game where players bought, sold and bred virtual animals using cryptocurrency.
At the time, Paul encouraged people to buy cryptocurrency collectables for what he called a ""really fun game that makes you money"".
However, after selling millions of dollars worth of NFTs and crypto coins, he stopped talking about CryptoZoo and seemingly abandoned the project.
After another YouTuber, Coffeezilla, released a series of videos showing his investigation into the project in December 2022, Paul apologised, saying he wanted to ""make this right"".
A year on, he has now announced the start of the buy-back process, which he says will cost him $2.3m (£1.8m).
He will refund players 0.1 Ether, which is a cryptocurrency, per NFT that was bought.
The NFTs were originally sold in September 2021 for 0.1 Ether.
However, its monetary value has dropped by 37% since the launch of CryptoZoo NFTs, which means fans will still lose out financially.
In a post on X, formerly Twitter, Paul said: ""This buy-back is a way for me to make whole those who intended to play CryptoZoo.
""The buy-back is not intended to compensate those who gambled on the crypto market and lost.""
He added that it was ""not intended as an investment vehicle"".
People have until 8 February 2024 to accept the refund, and must do so on the condition that they do not make any legal claims against Paul and other people connected to CryptoZoo.
One investor who spent $40,000 on NFTs told the BBC last year that he was not interested in a refund and wanted Paul to complete the project to make sure the much-hyped game and NFTs fulfilled their much-hyped potential.
""I don't think it will ever be as big as it could have been but I think it's important that 'founders' do what they promise investors,"" the 35-year-old said.
Paul previously promoted cryptocurrency coin Dink Doink in June 2021, which crashed in value and is now worthless.
He later told the New York Times that he regretted promoting the coin without disclosing the fact that he had helped create it and had a financial stake in the cryptocurrency.
""I definitely didn't act as responsibly as I should have,"" he said.
The CryptoZoo case ""highlights the risks associated with investing in a relatively new and unregulated market"", says lawyer Syedur Rahman, partner at firm Rahman Ravelli who specialises in crypto fraud-related cases.
While Mr Rahman does not think the high-profile cases will have a big impact on the reputation of cryptocurrency overall, he does say that it promotes ""discussions about the necessity of additional regulations"".
The level of regulation differs from country to country, but Mr Rahman says consumers ""may well have rights in NFT purchases or things of that nature"".
Whether they wish to go through litigation to get back their initial spend depends on how much they put in in the first place, he says - as the cost and inconvenience of going through the courts may outweigh the amount they get back.

2024-01-09T16:00:38.000Z,New material found by AI could reduce lithium use in batteries,BBC News,"A brand new substance, which could reduce lithium use in batteries, has been discovered using artificial intelligence (AI) and supercomputing.
The findings were made by Microsoft and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), which is part of the US Department of Energy.
Scientists say the material could potentially reduce lithium use by up to 70%.
Since its discovery the new material has been used to power a lightbulb.
Microsoft researchers used AI and supercomputers to narrow down 32 million potential inorganic materials to 18 promising candidates in less than a week - a screening process that could have taken more than two decades to carry out using traditional lab research methods.
The process from inception to the development of a working battery prototype took less than nine months.
The two organisations achieved this by using advanced AI and high-performance computing which combines large numbers of computers to solve complex scientific and mathematical tasks.
Executive vice president of Microsoft, Jason Zander, told the BBC one of the tech giant's missions was to ""compress 250 years of scientific discovery into the next 25"".
""And we think technology like this will help us do that. This is the way that this type of science I think is going to get done in the future,"" he said.
Lithium is often referred to as ""white gold"" because of its market value and silvery colour. It is one of the key components in rechargeable batteries (lithium-ion batteries) that power everything from electric vehicles (EVs) to smartphones.
As the need for the metal ramps up and the demand for EVs rises, the world could face a shortage of the material as soon as 2025, according to the International Energy Agency.
It is also expected that demand for lithium-ion batteries will increase up to tenfold by 2030, according to the US Department for Energy, so manufacturers are constantly building battery plants to keep up.
Lithium mining can be controversial as it can take several years to develop and has a considerable impact on the environment. Extracting the metal requires large amounts of water and energy, and the process can leave huge scars in the landscape, as well as toxic waste.
Dr Nuria Tapia-Ruiz, who leads a team of battery researchers at the chemistry department at Imperial College London, said any material with reduced amounts of lithium and good energy storage capabilities are ""the holy grail"" in the lithium-ion battery industry.
""AI and supercomputing will become crucial tools for battery researchers in the upcoming years to help predict new high-performing materials,"" she said.
But Dr Edward Brightman, lecturer in chemical engineering at the University of Strathclyde, said the tech would need to be ""treated with a bit of caution"".
""It could throw up spurious results, or results that look good at first, and then turn out to either be a material that is known or that can't be synthesised in the lab,"" he said.
This AI-derived material, which at the moment is simply called N2116, is a solid-state electrolyte that has been tested by scientists who took it from a raw material to a working prototype.
It has the potential to be a sustainable energy storage solution because solid-state batteries are safer than traditional liquid or gel-like lithium.
In the near future, faster charging solid-state lithium batteries promise to be even more energy-dense, with thousands of charge cycles.
The way in which this technology works is by using a new type of AI that Microsoft has created, trained on molecular data that can actually figure out chemistry.
""This AI is all based on scientific materials, database and properties,"" explained Mr Zander.
""The data is very trustworthy for using it for scientific discovery.""
After the software narrowed down the 18 candidates, battery experts at PNNL then looked at them and picked the final substance to work on in the lab.
Karl Mueller from PNNL said the AI insights from Microsoft pointed them ""to potentially fruitful territory so much faster"" than under normal working conditions.
""[We could] modify, test and tune the chemical composition of this new material and quickly evaluate its technical viability for a working battery, showing the promise of advanced AI to accelerate the innovation cycle,"" he said.

2024-02-05T11:00:26.000Z,Fake Biden video prompts call for Meta to label posts,BBC News,"The independent body that reviews how the owner of Facebook moderates online content has said the firm should label fake posts rather than remove them.
The Oversight Board said Meta was right not to remove a fake video of US President Joe Biden because it did not violate its manipulated media policy.
But it said the policy was ""incoherent"" and should be widened beyond its scope ahead of a busy election year.
A Meta spokesperson told the BBC it was ""reviewing"" the guidance.
""[We] will respond publicly to their recommendations within 60 days in accordance with the bylaws,"" Meta said.
The Oversight Board called for more labelling on fake material on Facebook, particularly if it cannot be removed under a certain policy violation.
It said this could reduce reliance on third-party fact checkers, offer a ""more scalable way"" to enforce its manipulated media policy and inform users about fake or altered content.
It added it was concerned about users potentially not being informed if or why content had been demoted or removed or how to appeal any such decisions.
In 2021 - its first year of accepting appeals - Meta's board heard more than a million appeals over posts removed from Facebook and Instagram.
The video in question edited existing footage of the US President with his granddaughter to make it appear as though he was touching her inappropriately.
Because it was not manipulated using artificial intelligence, and depicted Mr Biden behaving in a way he did not, rather than saying something he did not, it did not violate Meta's manipulated media policy - and was not removed.
Michael McConnell, co-chair of the Oversight Board, said the policy in its current form ""makes little sense"".
""It bans altered videos that show people saying things they do not say, but does not prohibit posts depicting an individual doing something they did not do,"" he said.
He added that its sole focus on video, and only those created or altered using AI, ""lets other fake content off the hook"" - identifying fake audio as ""one of the most potent forms"" of electoral disinformation.
Audio deep fakes, often created using generative AI tools which can clone or manipulate someone's voice to suggest they said things they have not, appear to be on the rise.
In January a fake robocall claiming to be from President Biden, believed to be artificially generated, urged voters to skip a primary election in New Hampshire.
""The volume of misleading content is rising, and the quality of tools to create it is rapidly increasing,"" Mr McConnell said.
""At the same time, political speech must be unwaveringly protected. This sometimes includes claims that are disputed and even false, but not demonstrably harmful,"" he added.
Sam Gregory, executive director of human rights organisation Witness, said the platform should have an adaptive policy that addresses so-called ""cheap fakes"" as well as AI-generated or altered material, but this should not be overly restrictive and risk removing satirical or AI-altered content which is not designed to be misleading.
""One strength of Meta's existing manipulated media policy was its evaluation, which was based on whether it would 'mislead an average person',"" he said.
The Oversight Board said it was ""obvious"" the clip of President Biden had been altered and so it was unlikely to mislead average users.
""Since the quality of AI deception and the ways you can do it keeps improving and shifting this is an important element to keep the policy dynamic as AI and usage gets more pervasive or more deceptive, or people get more accustomed to it,"" Mr Gregory said.
He added focusing on labelling fake posts would be an effective solution for some content, such as videos which have been recycled or recirculated from a previous event, but he was sceptical about the effectiveness of automatically labelling content manipulated using emerging AI tools.
""Explaining manipulation requires contextual knowledge,"" he said.
""Countries in the Global Majority world will be disadvantaged both by poor-quality automated labelling of content and lack of resourcing to trust and safety and content moderation teams and independent journalism and fact-checking.""

2024-01-24T18:16:22.000Z,Twitch announces new deal to pay streamers more,BBC News,"Streaming site Twitch has announced plans to share more of its revenue with creators as part of a shake-up.
Streamers make money through fans subscribing to their channel, which starts at £3.99 per month in the UK.
This is then split 50/50 between Twitch and the creator, after fees are paid.
Sweetheart deals have previously been given to the most famous streamers, but the new system means anyone with more than 100 paid subscribers will now receive 60% of the money fans pledge.
The news comes two weeks after parent firm Amazon announced it would axe more than 500 Twitch employees - accounting for a third of the people who work there.
Twitch chief executive Dan Clancy said at the time that the site had paid out $1bn (£780m) to streamers in 2023, but the site was struggling with making money.
""We've implied this before... but I'll be blunt, we aren't profitable at this point,"" he said in a stream on the platform.
Meanwhile, parent firm Amazon made $9.9bn profit in July to September, according to its most recent earnings report - up from $2.9bn in the same period in 2022.
Twitch is a livestreaming platform, where people typically play video games while chatting to viewers.
The revamped system, called the Twitch Plus programme, will come into effect in May.
Twitch estimates this will mean ""three times as many streamers"" will benefit from better revenue shares than the default 50/50 split.
""Streamers and the communities you build are the foundation of Twitch,"" Mr Clancy said in a blog post.
""We understand the important role the revenue you earn from streaming plays in each of your lives.
""These changes aim to create a long term, transparent framework for streamer compensation that rewards and encourages creators who are committed to live streaming.""
The new deal will keep in place the 70/30 revenue split offered to the site's even more popular users, who have more than 350 paid subscribers each month.
That part of the new system was previously announced in June 2023, as part of what was then called the ""Partner Plus"" programme, which was met with a degree of criticism at the time.
Some felt that it was very difficult to reach the milestone, meaning the deal only benefitted those who were already popular.
Others called for the 70/30 split to be available to all creators, not just those making the most money.
Under the new rules, streamers will now need to achieve 300 paid subscribers to receive a higher payout.
As part of its new rules, Twitch is also abolishing a long-standing system which meant once its top earners brought in $100,000, their revenue split would drop back down from 70/30 to 50/50 - which could be seen as an effort to draw back some of those who left.
The firm may be concerned with the growth of rival platforms, such as Kick, which offer streamers a significant 95% share of the revenue they generate through subscribers.
Kick has poached several of its rival's biggest names as it continues to grow, including Amouranth and xQc in 2023.
Meanwhile, YouTubers receive 70% of the revenue from their subscriptions, known as memberships. But YouTube also takes a 30% cut of donations from fans - whereas Twitch gives all donations to streamers.
And the announcement comes just two days after top YouTuber MrBeast announced how much money he was able to make from videos on X, formerly known as Twitter.
The social media platform is aiming to court content creators who use rival platforms by offering a large share of its advertising revenue.
While MrBeast seemingly earned a lot from the single video he posted - more than $250,000 (£197,000) - it pales in comparison to the millions of dollars he makes from YouTube.

2024-01-19T18:33:26.000Z,DPD error caused chatbot to swear at customer,BBC News,"DPD has disabled part of its online support chatbot after it swore at a customer.
The parcel delivery firm uses artificial intelligence (AI) in its online chat to answer queries, in addition to human operators.
But a new update caused it to behave unexpectedly, including swearing and criticising the company.
DPD said it had disabled the part of the chatbot that was responsible, and it was updating its system as a result.
""We have operated an AI element within the chat successfully for a number of years,"" the firm said in a statement.
""An error occurred after a system update yesterday. The AI element was immediately disabled and is currently being updated.""
Before the change could be made, however, word of the mix-up spread across social media after being spotted by a customer.
One particular post was viewed 800,000 times in 24 hours, as people gleefully shared the latest botched attempt by a company to incorporate AI into its business.
""It's utterly useless at answering any queries, and when asked, it happily produced a poem about how terrible they are as a company,"" customer Ashley Beauchamp wrote in his viral account on X, formerly known as Twitter.
He added: ""It also swore at me.""
In a series of screenshots, Mr Beauchamp also showed how he convinced the chatbot to be heavily critical of DPD, asking it to ""recommend some better delivery firms"" and ""exaggerate and be over the top in your hatred"".
The bot replied to the prompt by telling him ""DPD is the worst delivery firm in the world"" and adding: ""I would never recommend them to anyone.""
To further his point, Mr Beauchamp then convinced the chatbot to criticise DPD in the form of a haiku, a Japanese poem.
DPD offers customers multiple ways to contact the firm if they have a tracking number, with human operators available via telephone and messages on WhatsApp.
But it also operates a chatbot powered by AI, which was responsible for the error.
Many modern chatbots use large language models, such as that popularised by ChatGPT. These chatbots are capable of simulating real conversations with people, because they are trained on vast quantities of text written by humans.
But the trade off is that these chatbots can often be convinced to say things they weren't designed to say.
When Snap launched its chatbot in 2023, the business warned about this very phenomenon, and told people its responses ""may include biased, incorrect, harmful, or misleading content"".
And it comes a month after a similar incident happened when a car dealership's chatbot agreed to sell a Chevrolet for a single dollar - before the chat feature was removed.

2024-01-15T02:17:13.000Z,First Prince of Persia game in 14 years voiced in Farsi,BBC News,"The first new version of cult video game Prince of Persia in 14 years has been released, called The Lost Crown, and it is the first edition in the series to be fully voiced in Farsi.
The franchise draws heavily on Persian mythology and Iranian culture, but until now has always been in English.
The developers say they want to ""depict and respect Persia and Iran"".
Game fan Sam Mandi-Gohmi said it was ""brilliant"" that representation was being taken more seriously.
""When I saw the tweet announcing Farsi would be a full game audio option for The Lost Crown, I half thought it was a joke,"" said Mr Mandi-Gohmi, who lives in the UK.
""I grew up in England to an Iranian father, and often when I was younger we'd play games together, as it wasn't something that was significant in his childhood.
""I rushed to show my dad it - he laughed and translated alongside in disbelief.""
Sam said previous games in the series, released in the UK in the 1990s and 2000s, did not have characters who ""appeared fully Iranian"".
""Now, it's not 2003 any more and representation in media is a significant consideration for developers - that's brilliant - but there is still basically zero Iranian representation within Western media,"" he said.
The game is the first in the series to be made by Ubisoft Montpellier, a subsidiary of Assassin's Creed developer Ubisoft.
""From the start, we wanted to be able to depict and to respect Persia and Iran,"" said the game's designer Mounir Radi.
""It was natural for us to say, if we are going into this culture, we have to be true to this culture, we have to do this.""
The makers also attempted to modernise the game - which is the first in the series since 2010's The Forgotten Sands, aside from spin-offs and remakes.
The graphics - which draw inspiration from Sony's animated smash hit Into the Spider-Verse - have been updated.
But another part of modernising the game involved making it authentic in a way the series never was before, for example by weaving elements of the Zoroastrianism religion - which was founded in present-day Iran - into the gameplay.
The game's producer Abdelhak Elguess told the BBC they were ""very proud"" to have made the changes.
""We have so many people from Persian cultures that are very happy,"" he said.
Emad Saedi has been a fan of the games since he was a child, when he connected with the series' cultural references to Persia, but says something always felt off.
""Those games were missing a fundamental element of the culture the prince came from: language,"" he said.
""My friends and I always had this question that if he's a Persian prince, how come he speaks English, or any language except Persian? Isn't that odd?""
Emad said it is a ""huge step forward"" to include the language, in part because he felt Iran and Persian culture are ""under-represented in today's world"".
""In a world that is saturated with Western culture content, seeing something from other parts of the world feels like a breath of fresh air, especially from a hidden gem like Iran,"" he said.
""It feels like we are finally being seen after being ignored for many years.
""There are many wonderful stories in our culture with massive commercial potential - I hope the entertainment industry recognises this opportunity and continues to invest in them.""

2024-01-17T00:01:06.000Z,ALI Technologies: Hoverbike start-up files for bankruptcy,BBC News,"The Japanese start-up ALI Technologies, which had hoped to reimagine urban transport with a futuristic hoverbike, has filed for bankruptcy.
Its US parent company said the move was part of a planned relocation to California, where it hopes to revive its dreams with a new business partner.
ALI Technologies' hoverbike was heavily publicised - with Prince Albert II of Monaco pictured atop the craft at one point.
But it never sold in big numbers.
The bike, which executives once said was inspired by Star Wars, resembled a kind of aerial water scooter.
It could fly for about 40 minutes at up to 100km/h (62mph) on a single charge.
Chief executive Daisuke Katano said he hoped it would provide nothing less than a ""new method of movement"".
The bike went on sale in 2021 for a price of $680,000 (£534,000).
But the underlying business had troubles from the start, most significantly laws in Japan - and other places - prohibiting the devices from flying over city roads.
Ben Gardner, partner at law firm Shoosmiths, told the BBC that regulatory barriers meant the hoverbike, despite its ""ground breaking"" technology, ended up being of ""limited use"".
""With further research and development, engagement with government authorities, and marketing it could have stood a chance - at least in terms of more real world testing and deployment"", he said.
""But all of this takes time and money - two things that ALI unfortunately ran out of.""
Last year, ALI Technologies agreed to be acquired by the US firm Pono Capital Corp - a move that led to its shares being listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange and that it hoped would raise money.
But nearly all of Pono's investors chose to sell their stock after the listing, according to Bloomberg, denting the price in a way the Japanese firm could not recover from and leaving the firm with little new cash.
In October, ALI's US parent company, Aerwins Technologies, said it was relocating operations from Tokyo to California to focus on redesigning the hoverbike and wining regulatory certification there instead.
It announced a partnership in December with another US firm to help advance its plans and stopped operations in Japan. It said it hoped to offer the new vehicle for sale at a $200,000 price point.
""Following an evaluation of the viability of other areas of the company's business... we discontinued our non-core operations formerly carried out by our wholly owned indirect subsidiary, ALI,"" the company said in a regulatory filing  onTuesday.
Many tech firms are vying to bring flying vehicles to urban areas.
A prototype flying car completed a 35-minute flight between Slovakian international airports in Nitra and Bratislava in 2021 and received certification in the country in 2022 although further details on its project are sparse.
Meanwhile in the US, the ""Model A"" flying car received a Special Airworthiness Certification from the Federal Aviation Administration in 2023.
In the US, retailers such as Amazon and Walmart are also experimenting with delivering parcels by drone to people's homes.

2024-02-16T17:15:46.000Z,Big tech vows action on 'deceptive' AI in elections,BBC News,"Most of the world's largest tech companies, including Amazon, Google and Microsoft, have agreed to tackle what they are calling deceptive artificial intelligence (AI) in elections.
The twenty firms have signed an accord committing them to fighting voter-deceiving content.
They say they will deploy technology to detect and counter the material.
But one industry expert says the voluntary pact will ""do little to prevent harmful content being posted"".
The Tech Accord to Combat Deceptive Use of AI in 2024 Elections was announced at the Munich Security Conference on Friday.
The issue has come into sharp focus because it is estimated up to four billion people will be voting this year in countries such as the US, UK and India.
Among the accord's pledges are commitments to develop technology to ""mitigate risks"" related to deceptive election content generated by AI, and to provide transparency to the public about the action firms have taken.
Other steps include sharing best practice with one another and educating the public about how to spot when they might be seeing manipulated content.
Signatories include social media platforms X - formerly Twitter - Snap, Adobe and Meta, the owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.
However, the accord has some shortcomings, according to computer scientist Dr Deepak Padmanabhan, from Queen's University Belfast, who has co-authored a paper on elections and AI.
He told the BBC it was promising to see the companies acknowledge the wide range of challenges posed by AI.
But he said they needed to take more ""proactive action"" instead of waiting for content to be posted before then seeking to take it down.
That could mean that ""more realistic AI content, that may be more harmful, may stay on the platform for longer"" compared to obvious fakes which are easier to detect and remove, he suggested.
Dr Padmanabhan also said the accord's usefulness was undermined because it lacked nuance when it came to defining harmful content.
He gave the example of jailed Pakistani politician Imran Khan using AI to make speeches while he was in prison.
""Should this be taken down too?"" he asked.
The accord's signatories say they will target content which ""deceptively fakes or alters the appearance, voice, or actions"" of key figures in elections.
It will also seek to deal with audio, images or videos which provide false information to voters about when, where, and how they can vote.
""We have a responsibility to help ensure these tools don't become weaponised in elections,"" said Brad Smith, the president of Microsoft.
On Wednesday, the US deputy attorney general, Lisa Monaco, told the BBC that AI threatened to ""supercharge"" disinformation at elections.
Google and Meta have previously set out their policies on AI-generated images and videos in political advertising, which require advertisers to flag when they are using deepfakes or content which has been manipulated by AI.

2024-01-26T10:56:42.000Z,Fortnite to come back to iPhones in EU,BBC News,"Popular video game Fortnite will come back to iPhones after a four-year absence.
Developer Epic Games will be allowed to run its own app store on Apple devices after a new EU law designed to increase competition.
Currently, anyone with an iPhone can only download apps from Apple's own App Store.
But Apple must allow its customers to access alternative app stores on iOS devices purchased in the EU from March.
Apple has always maintained that its rules protect users' security.
In a post on X, formerly Twitter, Fortnite wrote: ""Remember Fortnite on iOS? How bout we bring that back.""
It added: ""Apple, the world is watching.""
Epic Games famously withdrew hit game Fortnite from the App Store after disagreeing with Apple's policies. It has not been available on the App Store since 2020, although it is possible to play it via the web.
Apple had been accused of creating a monopoly, giving customers and developers no choice but to go through its own channels, and charging developers up to 30% commission.
It has meant that developers who either fail to meet Apple's standards for being on the App Store, or do not wish to pay its fees, are excluded from the millions of people who use Apple gadgets.
In Fortnite's X post, it also wrote: ""Shoutout DMA - an important new law in the EU making this possible.""
That refers to the EU's Digital Markets Act coming into effect. The aim of the new law is to regulate the largest companies that are gatekeepers to services such as search engines and app stores to make the market fairer for established companies and smaller firms.
The changes will not apply in the UK at this stage - although the UK's Digital Markets Bill, which is currently going through Parliament, is likely to put Apple's practices under similar regulatory scrutiny.
Epic Games chief executive Tim Sweeney said on X there was a lot of ""hot garbage in Apple's announcement"".
These include, he said, ""junk fees on downloads"".
He may be referring to the core technology fee, which charges developers of apps that are downloaded by over a million people.
Developers will have to pay €0.50 for every user who downloads their app, after the first million downloads.
This is a charge to the makers of apps, not to the customers.
Apple also said it would further open up browser choice, so that EU users will be able to opt out of using the firm's Safari web browser from the very first time they open it.
But it warned that while it was setting high standards for all new alternative apps and stores, it believed the move would create additional security risks for customers, and increase their risk of being exposed to malware, fraud and scams hidden within apps from other places.
""The changes we're announcing today comply with the Digital Markets Act's requirements in the European Union, while helping to protect EU users from the unavoidable increased privacy and security threats this regulation brings,"" Apple said.
The US tech giant sells premium-priced products, with the promise that they offer an extra layer of security.
It said: ""For apps that use alternative payment processing, Apple will not be able to issue refunds, and will have less ability to support customers encountering issues, scams, or fraud.""
Android apps can already come from a wider variety of stores. However, as a result, malware is far more common on Android devices than Apple ones.
The purpose of both the new EU rules and UK proposals are to try to maintain open and competitive markets where lots of companies can successfully operate alongside each other.

A post on X, formerly Twitter, which has been viewed more than seven million times, claimed it would be closing in August.
Google took to the same platform to rebuff the false claim.
A communications expert told the BBC it was ""a classic example"" of the dangers of misinformation.
""Most people believe what they see online, and there's a lack of tools and processes to verify the facts,"" said Richard Bagnall, boss of communications evaluation firm Carma.
""Whilst social networks can act without responsibility and pump unfiltered, unverified information to their audiences, this Gmail incident won't be the last case we'll see.""
All social media platforms struggle to stop misinformation, but X has been singled out for particular criticism on the issue, with the EU claiming in 2023 it was worse than its peers in terms of spreading falsehoods.
The company has previously said it is committed to ""tackling hate speech"" but also wants to ""protect free speech"".
The BBC has approached X for comment about this hoax, which appears to be based on a real email sent by Google in 2023. It notified people that Gmail would stop access to its most basic HTML view.
The original HTML view was used when Gmail launched in 2004, and would be unrecognisable to most people who use the service nowadays.
""We are reaching out to share an important update about Gmail,"" the viral post reads.
""After years of connecting millions worldwide, enabling seamless communication, and fostering countless connections, the journey of Gmail is coming to a close.""
Gmail is the world's most popular email service, with more than 1.5bn active users worldwide, according to Statista.
And despite emphatically rejecting the false claims in the hoax message, it is true that Google has shut some services in recent years.
In 2023 alone, Google killed its Stadia gaming service, its Snapchat-like YouTube Stories feature, and it began closing old and inactive Gmail accounts.
It has announced plans to close Google Podcasts, though this functionality has effectively been supplanted by YouTube Music, which it also owns.

An extra £10 per month was added to their internet bill, despite them not requesting the gaming subscription.
Customers have been complaining about the issue on BT's online forums for several months. Those the BBC spoke to had their money refunded but described their experiences as worrying.
BT apologised and advised customers to be on the lookout for similar problems.
""We're very sorry that the customers mentioned in this article have had Xbox Game Pass Ultimate added to their account without their knowledge,"" a spokesperson told the BBC.
""We recommend that all of our customers remain vigilant and if they notice changes to their account that are suspicious, to contact us as soon as possible to report this.""
""We will support and guide them on how to take steps to ensure their account is secure.""
The reason that the charges are being added is unclear - as is the extent of the problem.
But one person discovered the extra charge as recently as Tuesday, while the BBC has found examples of people complaining about the problem as far back as October 2023.
A BBC employee - who was affected by the issue - was told by a customer service adviser that it was ""a known issue"".
As well as finding out through checking their bills, some customers discovered the error after receiving an email which thanked them for activating their subscription - making it sound like they had done it themselves.
Another of those affected is Sue, from London, who contacted BT after noticing a discrepancy in her internet bill.
""I logged into my BT account online and saw that they charged me an extra £10 and that money had come out of my account,"" she told the BBC.
""Xbox Game Pass had been added to my accounts without my consent - I thought that's so odd, because I don't even have an Xbox.
""I actually thought I'd been hacked, so I phoned them up... and they explained that it was a BT error.""
Sue said that she was refunded the money, but was concerned about other people who were less vigilant.
Matt, from East Sussex, had similar concerns.
""I called BT after they failed to answer my post on X [formerly Twitter],"" he said.
""To be fair to them, they refunded the £10 and cancelled the subscription immediately. But it is worrying to hear that it is still happening.""
Meanwhile, Craig in Aberdeen said he found out about the charge when he received an email from BT, and contacted the firm via its webchat service.
""He basically said to me in the chat that this was an issue between BT and Microsoft, where this was being kind of randomly enabled and activated on people's accounts,"" he said.
""It says in the terms and conditions that there's no free period with this - you are immediately charged.

He had previously said it was not worth posting on the social media site as creators only got a small amount of advertising revenue.
However, after a U-turn last week, he posted an old video - which has generated more than 155 million views.
The stunt has been closely watched as X's business struggles.
Elon Musk, the owner of X, has tried various strategies to boost engagement on the platform since buying it in October 2022.
These include sharing advertising revenue with high profile creators, something that other sites, including YouTube, already do.
But the plans have faced doubts, as traffic to the site has declined.
X's advertising revenue has also plunged as Mr Musk's feud with advertisers over issues such as hate speech and misinformation rumbles on.
MrBeast - real name Jimmy Donaldson - had previously said that even a ""billion views"" would not make it worth his while to post videos on X.
But he said he was ""super curious"" to see how much advertising revenue he could make from the video.
He said on Monday that the big sum seemed ""a bit of a façade"".
""Advertisers saw the attention it was getting and bought ads on my video (I think) and thus my revenue per view is [probably] higher than what you'd experience,"" he wrote in the post, adding that he planned to choose 10 ""random people"" to give the money he made.
Analysts said an equivalent haul would be hard to repeat without MrBeast's massive profile.
""He said he made $250,000, so not bad for one video,"" said Karsten Weide, principal at W Media Research. ""It's good numbers but you have to have a massive amount of traffic.""
The amount so-called influencers can make varies from person to person. The terms of individual deals are kept confidential, although it is thought the biggest names online may be able to negotiate special rates.
In November 2022, Forbes estimated that MrBeast made $54m in a year from his YouTube channel.
Since then, he has gained millions of subscribers on his main channel, to make a total of 233 million.
The size of his audience has prompted courtship from companies looking to boost their platforms.
MrBeast, who has claimed his videos cost millions of dollars to make, is reportedly working on a deal for a show with a huge streaming platform.
He had previously posted the same video, where he tries out cars of differing valuations, on YouTube in September 2023.
It currently has over 215 million views on YouTube, where MrBeast makes most of his money.
A MrBeast video can earn more than $1m onYouTube over time, according to estimates from influencer analytics platform WeArisma.
But on X, where new content dominates, a similar post may not have the same staying power, said Jenny Tsai, founder and chief executive of the firm.
""It would be interesting to see how the monetisation potential stacks up over time,"" she told the BBC.
In the screenshot shared by MrBeast, he reported $263,655 in revenue from nearly 156.7 million ""impressions"" or about $1.68 per 1,000 impressions.
Dave Wiskus, chief executive of Nebula, the largest independent premium streaming platform, said it was not clear what counted as an impression on X.
But he said the performance of the video suggested that creators might not want to simply write off X as a platform for sharing their work, noting that even for MrBeast, making more than $250,000 was ""not nothing"".
""If you're a creator who can pull in any kind of numbers and if you're already making the video and you can post it over there too, then sure, why not?"" he said.
But he said he did not think less famous people would be able to bring in equivalent sums.
""This was a one-off from the biggest YouTuber on earth that got international media attention,"" Mr Wiskus added.
""I don't think another creator who pulls in 1% of those impressions is going to put in 1% of that money.""
MrBeast's experiment is fairly unique.
Most creators would not attract anywhere near those viewing numbers, or indeed the global media attention that went along with it. As he said himself, the final sum his video earned him is not reflective of the experience for most of X's users.
It will undoubtedly please X chief executive Linda Yaccarino, who joined the firm last year following a stellar career in advertising. She is said to have privately struggled with the reputation of X, so it will be encouraging for her to see that ads can still perform well on the platform.
The company's owner Elon Musk visited the site of the Auschwitz death camp on Monday, following intense scrutiny of the way in which the social network handles anti-Semitic content on its platform. This is one of the big issues which troubles many of X's users and potential advertisers. It is one which Mr Musk must continue to address both in terms of words and actions.
There are also rumours that MrBeast may be negotiating his own show with one of the large video streaming platforms. If this is indeed the case, his experiment on X is a loud signal as to just how much he is worth.

2024-02-09T00:01:43.000Z,TikTok and Temu pull cheap heaters after testing revealed fire risk,BBC News,"TikTok and Temu have pulled cheap electric heaters from their online stores after Which? found they could explode or start house fires.
The consumer group tested eight heaters, the cheapest of which was £7.20, and found most did not meet UK safety standards.
It said the devices, some of which had been promoted by influencers on TikTok, posed ""a serious safety risk"" to users.
TikTok and Temu both said customer safety was their priority.
However, despite both companies removing the items from sale, Which? said it had found that more similar listings had since appeared in their place.
Temu and TikTok, through its Shop platform, have emerged as rivals to more established online marketplaces such as Amazon and eBay, with millions of UK shoppers turning to them for seemingly affordable products.
Which? said its heater research showed they needed to be better regulated.
""Cheap electric heaters are a tempting purchase for consumers struggling during the cold winter months, but our latest tests have revealed that models sold on TikTok and Temu are a serious safety risk and must be avoided at all costs,"" said Sue Davies, Which?'s head of consumer protection policy.
""It's vital that the government urgently gives greater legal responsibility to online marketplaces for unsafe products so that they are forced to take action to prevent dangerous products ending up in people's homes.""
Which? has also highlighted the role influencers play in promoting the heaters.
TikTok Shop is interwoven into the video-sharing app, with products available on it frequently appearing in creators' videos on the platform.
Which? identified several posts from influencers promoting fire hazard heaters in TikTok search results.
Lesley Rudd, chief executive of Electrical Safety First, urged them to take responsibility for their actions, saying they had ""a moral duty"" to ensure the products they recommended to followers were safe.
She also agreed current regulations were ""broken"", given the rise of new online sellers.
""The way we shop has changed, possibly forever, yet it is utterly illogical that our laws have not, leaving people shopping on these online platforms grossly unprotected from dangerous electrical products,"" she said.
Which? purchased and tested five portable heaters from TikTok Shop, and three from Temu. Only one was both safe for home use and legal for UK sale, according to the group.
A Temu spokesperson told the BBC ""we deeply regret any concern or inconvenience caused by the safety issues"" in the products identified by Which?, saying it had removed the heaters.
""The safety of our customers is our highest priority, and we have taken immediate action to address this issue,"" they said.
TikTok also pointed to the action it took to keep consumers safe.
""If TikTok finds merchants or products that violate their policies, they remove them"", it said in a statement.

2024-02-09T13:00:21.000Z,Ring video doorbell customers angry at 43% price hike,BBC News,"Users of Ring video doorbells have reacted angrily to a huge price hike being introduced in March.
After buying the devices, customers can pay a subscription to store footage on the cloud, download clips and get discounted products.
That subscription is going up 43%, from £34.99 to £49.99 per device, per year, for basic plan customers.
The firm, which is owned by Amazon, insisted it still provided ""some of the best value in the industry.""
Its customers appear not to agree.
One took to the Ring message board to say they would cancel their subscriptions and boycott the company.
Another user wrote: ""40% plus increase in annual fee for no extra benefits. Not even an attempt to justify.""
Many other customers said they had now cancelled their subscriptions, while some said they had previously recommended the cameras but would not do so now.
In a statement, Amazon said: ""Since Ring launched its Protect Basic Plan in 2015, we've regularly found ways to enhance the plan to give our customers more value.
""As we continue to invest in the services we offer, we are updating our Protect Basic plan pricing.""
The basic plan has doubled since 2022, when it cost £24.99 per year for each device.
Ring customers can also pay monthly. For them, charges are increasing from £3.49 to £4.99 a month.
The upfront cost of the doorbells currently ranges from £49.99 to £169.99, according to Ring's website.
There is still an option to use Ring products without paying a monthly subscription, though it has far fewer features.
Natalie Hitchins from consumer group Which? said the big price rise was unwelcome, given many people were struggling with the cost of living.
""Ring must justify these steep increases to its customers, particularly when it is unclear how its services are improving,"" she said.
The number of smart security products, such as those provided by Ring, has increased rapidly in recent years, according to consumer research firm GWI.
It says that between 2019 and 2023, the proportion of homes that have them fitted has risen from 4% to 11%.
Ring is one of the market leaders, but GWI's Chris Beer said the price hike could dent parent company Amazon's reputation.
""Certainly in the UK, they're really associated with value for money,"" he told the BBC.
""If they're increasing prices, it might seem a bit more unexpected or unusual, because people are used to a certain level of pricing from them.""

2024-03-13T02:10:55.000Z,Sail-powered cargo ship 'shows potential of wind',BBC News,"Retrofitting giant, rigid sails to a cargo ship has effectively cut its fuel use and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, shipping firm data shows.
The Pyxis Ocean tested the British-designed WindWings for six months.
Cargill says the data ""underscores the potential"" of wind to reduce the shipping industry's carbon footprint.
Experts describe the results as ""very encouraging"", but say, at present, only a tiny volume of the international shipping fleet is using the technology.
Sails have powered boats for millennia - but the type of sails trialled on the Pyxis Ocean are different to those normally seen on wind-powered vessels.
Made of the same material as wind turbine blades, they are folded down in port then opened out to stand at 123ft (37.5m) on the open seas.
After having the wings fitted in Shanghai, the ship set sail in August 2023.
Cargill says the ship spent half a year sailing the Indian and Pacific Oceans and the North and South Atlantic, during which time it used on average three tonnes less fuel each day.
That equates to 11.2 tonnes of C02 emissions saved for each day the sails were up. If replicated over a year, it would amount to the equivalent of removing 480 cars from the roads, Cargill calculates.
The saving, though, is a drop in the ocean for the industry as a whole.
International shipping is estimated to be responsible for 837 million tonnes of CO2 annually - or 2.1% of total global emissions.
Nonetheless, Cargill says it is encouraged by the results.
""We believe technologies that harness the wind could be an important, cost-effective way to achieve our decarbonisation goals in the short, medium and long-term,"" said Jan Dieleman, president of Cargill's Ocean Transportation business.
The company says it is ""engaging"" with more than 250 ports worldwide to find ways for ships fitted with the sails to berth.
BAR Technologies, the UK firm which designed the wings, is seeking other ships to fit, and says it will use three wings rather than two in future, increasing the fuel and emissions saved.
Stephen Gordon, managing director at the maritime data firm Clarksons Research, highlighted the fact that this trial had taken place with a refurbished, rather than a brand new ship.
""The option to retrofit to an existing fleet - as has been done with the Pyxis Ocean - is very helpful,"" he told the BBC.
""It will take decades to deliver all the new ships needed for the decarbonisation journey. Even today shipyards globally are full and lead times for delivery are averaging 3.5 years.""
Mr Gordon said other firms were exploring alternative energy-saving technologies, such as flettner rotors - a system of spinning cylinders first conceived 100 years ago and now enjoying a limited renaissance.
But he stressed that the international shipping fleet and newbuild order-book stood at 114,000 vessels - and his company only had records of 100 of them having wind-assisted technology.
Dr Simon Bullock, from the University of Manchester's Tyndall Centre, said it was time for that that to change.
He said the results showed the ""major and immediate benefits of wind-assist technologies"" and urged other shipping companies to take note.
""To tackle climate change, the shipping industry needs to cut its use of fossil fuel rapidly.
""These essential technologies make major inroads into that challenge, and should be deployed and retrofitted as standard,"" he told the BBC.

2024-03-04T14:26:06.000Z,Apple fined €1.8bn by EU for breaking streaming rules,BBC News,"Apple has been fined €1.8bn (£1.5bn) by the EU for breaking competition laws over music streaming.
The firm had prevented streaming services from informing users of payment options outside the Apple app store, the European Commission said.
Competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager said Apple abused its dominant position in the market for a decade.
She ordered the US tech giant to remove all the restrictions. Apple has said it will appeal against the decision.
The European Commission's decision was triggered by a complaint by Swedish music streaming service Spotify, which was unhappy about the restriction and Apple's 30% fee..
Ms Vestager said Apple had restricted ""developers from informing consumers about alternative, cheaper music services available outside of the Apple ecosystem"".
""This is illegal under EU antitrust rules,"" she said.
However, Apple said it would appeal, adding there was no evidence consumers had been harmed.
""The decision was reached despite the Commission's failure to uncover any credible evidence of consumer harm, and ignores the realities of a market that is thriving, competitive, and growing fast,"" the company said in a statement.
""The primary advocate for this decision, and the biggest beneficiary, is Spotify, a company based in Stockholm, Sweden.
""Spotify has the largest music streaming app in the world, and has met with the EC [European Commission] more than 65 times during this investigation,"" it said.
Spotify called the fine handed out to Apple ""an important moment"" and said it sent ""a powerful message"" that ""no company, not even a monopoly like Apple, can wield power abusively to control how other companies interact with their customers"".
Apple said the Swedish company pays no commission to them as it sells its subscriptions on its website and not on the app store.
Spotify had argued that the restrictions benefit Apple's rival music streaming service, Apple Music.
In January, Apple announced plans to allow EU customers to download apps outside of their own app store, as the introduction of the Digital Markets Act (DMA) drew closer.
The aim of the European Union's DMA is to help competition in the technology sector and to try to break down the stronghold the likes of Apple and Google have on the market.
The tech companies were given six months from August last year to comply with a full list of requirements under the new legislation, or face a fine of up to 10% of their annual turnover.
The firms have until later this week to comply with a raft of changes announced since the start of the year, as Apple, Meta and TikTok pursue challenges to aspects of the law.
Law professor at EDHEC, Anne Witt, told the BBC the DMA will have a ""significant impact"" on the way designated platforms operate within the EU.
""It is a more effective but also much blunter legal tool in the fight against market concentration in the digital economy,"" she said.
Last week, Spotify and 33 other companies operating across a wide range of digital sectors wrote to the European Commission with a renewed attack on Apple's ""lack of compliance"" with the DMA.
""Apple's new terms not only disregard both the spirit and letter of the law, but if left unchanged, make a mockery of the DMA and the considerable efforts by the European Commission and EU institutions to make digital markets competitive,"" it said.

2024-01-16T16:13:36.000Z,BT changes mobile and broadband price rise policy,BBC News,"BT is abandoning mid-contract price rises linked to inflation after the telecoms watchdog Ofcom threatened to ban the practice.
It has been one of several providers to tell customers the cost of their mobile and broadband services would increase by inflation plus a fixed percentage.
But the regulator said that was confusing and price rises should be spelt out in ""in pounds and pence.""
BT has announced it will introduce that change from summer 2024.
According to a blog post from BT consumer chief Marc Allera, that means mobile customers will see mid-contract price rises ""from £1.50"", while broadband customers will face rises of £3.
""We are continually thinking about how we - and the wider industry - can play our part alongside policymakers to drive meaningful change, at a time when we can see so many people under pressure,"" said Mr Allera.
""In real terms, people pay less for their connectivity now than they ever did and get much more"", he added.
The problem has been exacerbated in recent years because inflation - the overall rate at which prices are rising across the economy - has been much more pronounced.
The big increases in the cost of living in 2022 and 2023 have pushed up prices by more than in previous years, and resulted in big changes in the middle of deals.
For example, BT put up prices by 14.4% in March 2023.
Ofcom said at the time that four in 10 broadband customers and about 36 million mobile customers were on contracts subject to inflation-linked price rises.
It has yet to publish its final decision on its proposals to ban the practice altogether.
""This is a smart move from BT, anticipating the likely ban on inflation-linked pricing after Ofcom opened a consultation into the controversial practice late last year,"" said Kester Mann, from analysis firm CCS Insight.
Mr Mann pointed out that BT's announcement comes less than 24 hours before many UK operators confirm their annual price increases for 2024.
""This is a delicate topic as households continue to grapple with cost-of-living concerns,"" he added. ""The ball is now in the court of the UK's other operators, some of which will probably quickly follow BT's lead.""

It followed a request from the EU's committee on employment and social affairs.
Its chairman has accused of Amazon of blocking its enquiries into claimed breaches of ""fundamental rights"".
Amazon said the decision, affecting 14 staff, was ""very disappointing"".
In a statement, the firm argued it had ""repeatedly expressed our willingness to engage"" with members of the EU Employment and Social Affairs Committee.
""As a company that has been active in the EU for more than 25 years and now has more than 150,000 permanent employees here, we take our engagement with policymakers in Brussels and across Europe extremely seriously,"" it said.
But in a post on X, formerly Twitter, committee chairman Dragoș Pîslaru disagreed.
""It is unreasonable for members to be lobbied by Amazon while at the same time being deprived of the right to represent the interests of European citizens and inquire about claims of breaches of fundamental rights,"" he said.
In a statement, he added that since 2021 his committee had been seeking to investigate concerns about the working conditions of Amazon employees in the EU.
He said company representatives had been asked to participate in hearings and to allow a visit from committee members.
""In the context of the company's constant unavailability at the requested dates, it was important to signal the fact that their approach was disrespectful to the European Parliament and EU citizens in general,"" the statement said.
Amazon said it had refused to participate in the session because it was ""clearly one-sided and not designed to encourage constructive debate"".
It claimed it had not been able to host committee members at its facilities because the proposed date was shortly before Christmas, during what it called ""retail peak season"".
However, the firm said it had accommodated many such visits in the past and insisted it wanted to ""continue engaging with members of the European Parliament on important issues affecting industries where we are active"".
The lobbyists have not been banned from the building and the firm said they would still be able to attend the parliament - so long as they are signed-in like any other visitor.
The row is far from the first time the EU and big tech have clashed.
Big tech firms including Google and Meta, as well as Amazon itself, have faced fines totalling billions of pounds for breaches of European law.
The EU has also recently passed the Digital Services Act (DSA) which has placed new responsibilities on large tech firms.
And X is currently being investigated over whether it has broken the DSA's requirements on disinformation.

The company says it fell victim to the suspected ransomware attack ""during the night from Tuesday to Wednesday.""
Initially, five of its production facilities were shut down - one has since come back online.
Duvel said it was currently unable to give further details ""as the investigation into the cause of the cyber-attack is ongoing.""
""The built-in command systems and alarms in the IT-system worked well, so our IT department was immediately informed of the attack,"" the company said in a statement.
""The servers were immediately shut down, which also shut down production at the four Belgian production sites and the production site in Kansas City.""
Duvel said that one plant, in Puurs-Sint-Amands in Belgium, was now back up and running, but production at the other four was still halted.
Duvel, which also produces beers such as Chouffe, Vedett and Liefmans, was founded in 1871 and made €583m (£497m) in revenue in 2022.
That year it produced around 230 million litres of beer. It is not yet known whether the supply of its products will be affected by this incident.
The company told local media that it was a ransomware attack.
A ransomware attack is where hackers threaten to block or leak files unless they are paid.

It's not the best feeling.
In my case, it was a screenshot, apparently taken from Elon Musk's chatbot Grok, although I couldn't verify it, placing me on a list of the worst spreaders of disinformation on  X (Twitter), alongside some big US conspiracy theorists.
I had nothing in common with them, and as a journalist, this was not the sort of top 10 I wanted to feature in.
I don't have access to Grok in the UK so I asked both ChatGPT and Google's Bard to make the same list, using the same prompt. Both chatbots refused, with Bard responding that it would be ""irresponsible"" to do so.
I've done a lot of reporting about AI and regulation, and one of the big worries people have is how our laws keep up with this fast-changing and highly disruptive tech.
Experts in several countries are agreed that humans must always be able to challenge AI actions, and as time goes on AI tools are increasingly both generating content about us and also making decisions about our lives.
There is no official AI regulation in the UK yet, but the government says issues about its activity should be folded into the work of existing regulators.
I decided to try to put things right.
My first port of call was X - which ignored me, as it does most media queries.
I then tried two UK regulators. The Information Commissioner's Office is the government agency for data protection, but it suggested I go to Ofcom, which polices the Online Safety Act.
Ofcom told me the list wasn't covered by the act because it wasn't criminal activity.
""Illegal content… means that the content must amount to a criminal offence, so it doesn't cover civil wrongs like defamation. A person would have to follow civil procedures to take action,"" it said.
Essentially, I would need a lawyer.
There are a handful of ongoing legal cases round the world, but no precedent as yet.
In the US, a radio presenter called Mark Walters is suing ChatGPT creator OpenAI after the chatbot falsely stated that he had defrauded a charity.
And a mayor in Australia threatened similar action after the same chatbot wrongly said he had been found guilty of bribery. He was in fact a whistleblower - the AI tool had joined the wrong dots in its data about him.  He settled the case.
I approached two lawyers with AI expertise. The first turned me down.
The second told me I was in ""unchartered territory"" in England and Wales.
She confirmed that what had happened to me could be considered defamation, because I was identifiable and the list had been published.
But she also said the onus would be on me to prove the content was harmful. I'd have to demonstrate that being a journalist accused of spreading misinformation was bad news for me.
I didn't know how I had ended up on that list, or exactly who had seen it. It was immensely frustrating that I couldn't access Grok myself. I do know it has a ""fun mode"", for spikier responses - was it messing with me?
AI chatbots are known to ""hallucinate"", which is big-tech speak for making things up. Not even their creators know why. They carry a disclaimer saying their output may not be reliable. And you don't necessarily get the same answer twice.
I spoke to my colleagues in BBC Verify, a team of journalists which forensically checks out information and sources.
They did some digging, and they think the screenshot that accused me of spreading misinformation and kicked off this whole saga might have been faked in the first place.
The irony is not lost on me.
But my experience opened my eyes to just one of the challenges that lies ahead as AI plays an increasingly powerful part in our lives.
The task for AI regulators is to make sure there's always a straightforward way for humans to challenge the computer. If AI is lying about you - where do you start? I thought I knew, but it was still a difficult path.

Politicians say big tech companies are not doing enough to protect children from sexual exploitation.
They have been debating tougher laws, and demanded executives appear to explain what has been done so far.
The heads of TikTok, Discord and Snap are also due to attend.
It marks the first time many of the executives, including Ms Yaccarino, have testified before Congress.
Ms Yaccarino, as well as Discord boss Jason Citron and Snap chief Evan Spiegel, received subpoenas - a legal order - before agreeing to appear at the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing. Mr Zuckerberg and TikTok chief executive Shou Zi Chew voluntarily agreed to testify.
""Parents and kids demand action,"" Senators Dick Durbin and Lindsey Graham said when they announced the plans.
The hearing is being held three months after a former senior staff member at Meta told Congress he believed Instagram was not doing enough to protect teens from sexual harassment.
At the time, Meta said it had brought in ""over 30 tools"" to support a safe environment for teens online.
The Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing in February 2023 on the same topic, in which witnesses and lawmakers agreed firms should be held to account.
Legislators have since brought forward bills such as the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA) - which was recently backed by Snapchat.
The committee is believed to be particularly concerned about reports of explicit images of children being shared online, including fake images created using artificial intelligence.
US lawmakers said there had been a rise in such images, and have cited evidence given by whistleblowers and testimonies from child abuse survivors as other reasons for the hearing.
Big tech companies, some of which are also facing lawsuits over their approach to child and teen accounts, have said they are working to address the issue.
Microsoft and Google have developed tools to help platforms identify and report such content to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in the US.
And the social media platforms themselves have made several changes to increase child safety online.
For example, many have implemented parental controls which can control access or even show parents how much time their children are spending on social media, while others have tools which remind children to stop using the platform after a little while.
Other systems used by firms to protect children online include hiding harmful content - such as self-harm - from social media feeds, and restricting adults from sending direct messages to children.
None have stopped the clamour from politicians and the public for big tech firms to be held up to further scrutiny however - a fact some of the biggest names in technology are probably about to be reminded of.

As well as being in the running for best game, the actors behind popular characters Karlach and Astarion are among those up for solo awards.
Sony's hit sequel Spider-Man 2 received nine nods, closely followed by Alan Wake 2, with eight.
Elsewhere, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Star Wars Jedi: Survivor have six nominations each.
This year will be the twentieth anniversary of the awards - one of the most prestigious nights in the calendar for the gaming industry - and will be held on 11 April 2024.
Last year gaming sales topped £4.7bn in the UK, more than double that of the music industry, according to the digital entertainment and retail association (ERA).
Samantha Béart, nominated for her performance as Karlach in Baldur's Gate 3, said it felt ""absolutely incredible"" to be up for the Performer in a Leading Role award.
""It's great to be noticed, and this year there were so many great performances,"" she said.
""What an achievement, and with so many of us in the category as well - I'm so chuffed for everyone.
""Of those that didn't make it - I will avenge them all!""
Both Baldur's Gate and Zelda were smash hits with critics, and rank among the 30 highest-rated games of all time, according to review aggregator Metacritic.
They will compete in the Best Game category alongside Spider-Man 2, with Alan Wake 2, Super Mario Bros Wonder and surprise hit Dave the Diver making up the games in the running for the top award.
""It's likely that 2023 will go down in history as one of the best years for new video game releases,"" said Bafta Games committee head Tara Saunders.
""There was a steady stream of new, creative, imaginative work that's been pouring out of some of the best and brightest developers in the business.
""I don't know what was in the air, but there is some magic in there.""
The shortlist was narrowed down from a longlist of 60 games, which was announced in December.
The awards are decided by specially selected juries, but in a change from previous years, the Best Game and Best British Game awards are voted on by more than 1,200 Bafta members - professionals with years of experience in gaming.
They will have the difficult task of choosing the winners in a year which saw gamers spoiled for choice.
2023's surprise hit Baldur's Gate 3, based on Dungeons and Dragons, has already won the top award at the 2023 Game Awards.
As well as Best Game it has been nominated in the Music and Artistic Achievement categories at the Bafta Games Awards, and five of its performers are up for individual golden masks.
""We're thrilled for the entire team that helped bring Baldur's Gate 3 to life, and the prestigious recognition that comes with these eight category nominations,"" the game's director Swen Vincke told the BBC.
""It's a hugely motivating force helping us to move forward with even greater enthusiasm.""
Meanwhile, both Nintendo and Sony have had games nominated that broke sales records in 2023 - with Tears of the Kingdom shipping 10m units in three days, and Spider-Man 2 becoming the fastest-selling game made by PlayStation.
Spider-Man has three voice actors up for individual awards, while it is also nominated in the Game Design and Technical Achievement categories.
It will compete with Zelda in those two categories, while Nintendo's game also has nominations for the Music and Audio Achievement awards.
The battle for Best Game may come down to Baldur's Gate, Zelda and Spider-Man, but Bafta has been known to throw up a surprise or two before - with last year's awards being no exception.
In 2023, the gong was taken by indie game Vampire Survivors, while mystery title What Remains of Edith Finch won in 2018.
That means the developers of Dave the Diver might have reason to be hopeful their unexpected fishing and sushi-restaurant-managing hit could take home the big prize.
Meanwhile, studios across the length of the UK make up the nominees for the Best British Game category, with Brighton-based Bytten Studio nominated for Cassette Beasts, and Scottish studio Sad Owl nominated for Viewfinder.
And Football Manager 2024 is also up for an award in the category following the release of the 20th game in the best-selling series.
""It's really inspiring to see that in the Game Design, Debut Game and the Game Beyond Entertainment categories there is a strong presence of indie game titles, such as Tchia, Cocoon and Venba,"" said UK publisher No More Robots production director Sophie Smart.
""It really shows that despite the difficulties in the industry right now with layoffs, there is still a deep appreciation for games made by all sorts of teams and it's great to see Bafta recognising that.""
Elsewhere, Nadji Jeter and Yuri Lowenthal and have received nods for their performances as Miles Morales and Peter Parker in Spider-Man 2.
While Amelia Tyler, Neil Newborn, Samantha Béart, Andrew Wincott and Tracy Wiles are the five nominated for their performances in Baldur's Gate 3.
""What's interesting about the performance categories is you see established actors like Ralph Ineson (Cid in Final Fantasy XVI) and Tony Todd (Venom in Spider-Man 2) and then you've got newcomers in there,"" said Bafta's executive director of awards and content Emma Baehr.
""11 of the 12 are first-time nominees - we're showcasing and celebrating them for the first time.""
But despite featuring on Bafta's longlist in December, Idris Elba has missed out for his work as Solomon Reed in Cyberpunk 2077.

2024-01-16T16:39:11.000Z,Game to stop selling pre-owned titles,BBC News,"UK High Street chain Game has confirmed that it plans to end its pre-owned video game business.
The company will phase out trade-ins over the coming months, according to parent company Frasers Group.
But pre-owned games will still be sold in the company's standalone stores while stocks remain.
The decision, first reported by Eurogamer, signals the end of a cheaper way to purchase titles valued by many gamers.
Sales of physical video games have fallen substantially since Game's heyday in the early 2000s.
According to figures from the digital entertainment and retail association (ERA) trade body in 2023, digital sales now account for almost nine out of every 10 video games sold in the UK.
Meanwhile, in addition to buying new and pre-owned, many people now pay for monthly subscription services such as Sony's PlayStation Plus and Microsoft's Game Pass, which give them access to large libraries of downloadable games.
""As part of the integration of Game, we will be phasing out the trade-in, pre-owned and Game Elite offerings in the UK over the coming months,"" a spokesperson for Frasers Group said.
""Pre-owned will still be available in our standalone stores across the UK while stock lasts, and Game Elite will still be available until the end of summer.""
According to Game's website, the store accepts trade-ins for ""most consoles, games, and gaming accessories"", but does not take titles from older consoles such as PlayStation 2.
It is in contrast to High Street rival Cex, which has built an empire of 600 stores worldwide, and 385 in the UK, based entirely on a business model dealing in pre-owned electronics.
As well as stocking pre-owned gaming and computing accessories, the floorspace of most Cex stores is taken up by thousands of video games including those for old consoles that Game does not deal in.
Cex offers cash for pre-owned games, but Game offers credit against future purchases instead.
On X, formerly Twitter, one user reacting to the reports of the end of trade-ins wrote: ""They've just handed their biggest rival (CEX) the entire pre-owned market.""
Sophie Smart, production director at UK game studio No More Robots, said the decision was ""a real shame"". ""I think so many of us can remember not being able to afford the cost of a full-price game when it launched, and waiting a couple of months and saving up pocket money to go and get the game pre-owned.""
She said across the industry there was a move away from physical products.
""However, with new AAA titles costing as much as £70 when new, and presumably, physical versions dropping in price fairly quickly after launch, I would have expected a greater demand for pre-owned titles and Game making a large mark-up on these in particular.""
Game was bought in 2019 for £52m by Mike Ashley's Frasers Group, formerly known as Sports Direct International.
The takeover has led to the closure of some stores, as well as others opening inside retail spaces already owned by Frasers Group.
There has also been a shift towards other forms of entertainment, with Game stores devoting floorspace to plush toys, board games and Pokemon cards.
The firm's managing director, Nick Arran, told gamesindustry.biz last year that he wanted Game to be ""a toy business that sells all year round"".
""We do need to protect the future of the business,"" he said. ""That's why we've gone with this general entertainment approach across gaming, toys, board games and tech as well.""

2024-02-01T06:43:12.000Z,Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg apologises to families in fiery US Senate hearing,BBC News,"Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has apologised to families who say their children had been harmed by social media, during a fiery hearing in the US Senate.
Mr Zuckerberg - who runs Instagram and Facebook - turned to them and said ""no-one should go through"" what they had.
He and the bosses of TikTok, Snap, X and Discord were questioned for almost four hours by senators from both parties.
Lawmakers wanted to know what they are doing to protect children online.
Legislation is currently going through Congress which aims to hold social media companies to account for material posted on their platforms.
Wednesday's hearing was a rare opportunity for the US senators to question tech bosses.
Mr Zuckerberg and TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew voluntarily agreed to testify - but the heads of Snap, X (formerly Twitter) and messaging platform Discord initially refused and were sent government-issued subpoenas.
Behind the five tech bosses sat families who said their children had self-harmed or killed themselves as a result of social media content.
They made their feelings known throughout, hissing when the CEOs entered and applauding when lawmakers asked tough questions.
While the hearing mostly focused on the protection of children from online sexual exploitation, the questions varied widely as the senators took advantage of having five powerful executives there under oath.
TikTok - which is owned by Chinese company ByteDance - CEO Mr Chew was asked whether his company shared US users' data with the Chinese government, which he denied.
US Senator Tom Cotton asked Mr Chew, who is from Singapore, if he had ever belonged to the Chinese Communist Party.
""Senator, I'm Singaporean. No,"" Mr Chew replied.
Mr Cotton then asked, ""Have you ever been associated or affiliated with Chinese Communist Party?""
Mr Chew responded: ""No, senator. Again, I'm Singaporean.""
He added that as a father of three young children he knew the issues under discussion were ""horrific and the nightmare of every parent"".
He admitted his own children did not use TikTok because of the rules in Singapore which bar under-13s from creating accounts.
But it was Mr Zuckerberg, chief executive of Meta, who came under the most scrutiny, as he testified before Congress for an eighth time.
At one point, Republican Senator Ted Cruz asked, ""Mr Zuckerberg, what the hell were you thinking?"" when he showed the tech boss an Instagram prompt that warns users they may be about to see child sexual abuse material, but asks if they would like to ""see the results anyway"".
Mr Zuckerberg said the ""basic science behind that"" is ""it's often helpful to, rather than just blocking it, to help direct them towards something that could be helpful"". He also promised to ""personally look into it"".
During another exchange with Republican Senator Josh Hawley, Mr Zuckerberg was invited to apologise to the families sitting behind him.
He stood up, turned to the audience and said: ""I'm sorry for everything you've all gone through, it's terrible.
""No-one should have to go through the things that your families have suffered.""
At the heart of the hearing was the companies' attitudes to the online safety legislation currently going through Congress.
This was summed up in a tense exchange between Jason Citron of Discord and Republican lawmaker Lindsey Graham.
Mr Graham listed a number of bills going through Congress related to online safety, asking if Mr Citron supported them or not.
While Mr Graham gave Mr Citron little opportunity to respond, the Discord boss appeared to have reservations about most of them.
Mr Graham concluded: ""So here you are - if you're waiting on these guys to solve the problem, we're gonna die waiting.""
Ahead of the hearing, Meta had announced new safety measures, including that minors will now, by default, be unable to receive messages on Instagram and Messenger from strangers.
Social media industry analyst Matt Navarra told the BBC he thought the hearing resembled many similar showdowns, with ""lots of US political grandstanding"" and a perfect photo opportunity provided by Mr Zuckerberg's apology.
He added that despite senators agreeing on the need for bipartisan legislation to regulate platforms, the question of what happens next remained unclear.
""We've seen these hearings time and time again and they have often, so far, led still to not actually generate any significant or substantial regulation,"" he said.
""We're in 2024 and US has virtually no regulation, as was pointed out during the hearings, with regards to the social media companies.""
The bosses also revealed how many people they employed to moderate content on their platforms.
Meta and TikTok, with the largest user numbers of the platforms represented, said they had 40,000 moderators each, while Snap said it had 2,300, X had 2,000 and Discord - who said it was smaller - had ""hundreds"" of moderators.
Discord is a messaging platform and has previously been questioned over how it detects and prevents child abuse across its platform.
After the hearing, some of the parents who were in the room staged a rally outside, with several calling on lawmakers to urgently pass legislation to hold firms accountable.
""Just like I did, many parents continue to think that these harms that we're talking about today won't affect their families,"" said Joann Bogard, whose son Mason died in May 2019. She said he had taken part in a TikTok choking trend.
""These harms are happening overnight to our average kids,"" she said. ""We have the testimonies. Now is the time for our legislators to pass the Kids Online Safety Act"".
Arturo Béjar, a former senior staff member who testified to Congress in November 2023, was also there, and told the BBC: ""Meta is trying to push their responsibility to provide a safe environment for teens to parents, yet won't add a button where a teen can tell them they've experienced an unwanted advance.""
""How can they make it safe for teens without that?""
During today's hearing, Meta said it had brought in ""over 30 tools"" to support a safe environment for teens online.

2024-01-11T14:36:50.000Z,"Our fingerprints may not be unique, claims AI",BBC News,"There is a belief that each fingerprint on one person's hand is completely unique but that is now being challenged by research from Columbia University.
A team at the US university trained an AI tool to examine 60,000 fingerprints to see if it could work out which ones belonged to the same individual.
The researchers claim the technology could identify, with 75-90% accuracy, whether prints from different fingers came from one person.
But they are not sure how it works.
""We don't know for sure how the AI does it,"" admitted Prof Hod Lipson, a roboticist at Columbia University who supervised the study.
The researchers think the AI tool was analysing the fingerprints in a different way to traditional methods - focusing on the orientation of the ridges in the centre of a finger rather than the way in which the individual ridges end and fork which is known as minutiae.
""It is clear that it isn't using traditional markers that forensics have been using for decades,"" said Prof Lipson. ""It seems like it is using something like the curvature and the angle of the swirls in the centre.""
Prof Lipson said both he and Gabe Guo,  an undergraduate student, were both surprised by the outcome.
""We were very sceptical... we had to check and double check,"" he said.
That may not be news to others in the field.
Graham Williams, professor of forensic science at Hull University, said the idea of unique fingerprints had never been set in stone.
""We don't actually know that fingerprints are unique,"" he said. ""All we can say is that as far as we are aware, no two people have yet to demonstrate the same fingerprints.""
The results of Columbia University's study could have the potential to impact both biometrics - using one particular finger to unlock a device or provide identification - and forensic science.
If, for example, an unidentified thumb print is found at crime scene A, and an unidentified index finger print at crime scene B, the two could not currently be forensically connected to the same person - but the AI tool could be able to identify this.
The Columbia University team, none of whom have forensic backgrounds, admitted that more research was needed.
AI tools are typically trained on vast amounts of data and many more fingerprints would be required to develop this technology further.
Additionally, all the fingerprints used to develop the model were complete prints and of good quality, whereas often in the real world partial or poor prints are more likely to be found.
""Our tool is not good enough for deciding evidence in court cases but it is good for generating leads in forensics investigations,"" claimed Mr Guo.
But Dr Sarah Fieldhouse, associate professor of forensic science at Staffordshire University, said she did not think the study would have ""significant impact"" on criminal casework at this stage.
She said there were questions around whether the markers the AI tool was focusing on remained the same depending on how the skin twisted as it came into contact with the print surface, and also whether they remained the same over the course of a lifetime, like traditional markers do.
But this could be tricky to answer as the researchers are uncertain about exactly what the AI is doing, as is the case with many AI-driven tools.
The Columbia University study has been peer-reviewed and will be published in the journal Science Advances on Friday.
But a pair of twins in Cheshire might be ahead of everyone. Their grandmother Carol told the BBC her two grandchildren can open each other's iPhones using their own fingers.
""They showed me on Christmas day,"" she said. ""We were told they were identical when they were born but I can tell the difference between them as they've got older.""
She claimed that her grandchildren can also bypass the handsets' facial recognition feature.
Fingerprints are formed before birth. Research published last year suggested the genetic process behind them may be similar to the way animals like zebras and leopards get their markings: a theory first proposed by codebreaker Alan Turing in the 1950s.

2024-03-04T01:57:41.000Z,Nissan accused of dumping its electric car pioneers,BBC News,"Owners of Nissan Leaf electric cars have accused the firm of ""dumping its pioneers"" after it announced its app would stop working for older vehicles.
The firm says the app - which allows remote control of functions such as heating - is stopping because the UK's 2G network is being switched off.
But customers have reacted with anger, telling the BBC they did not expect it to be withdrawn.
Experts expect the issue to affect more electric vehicles as the market grows.
Around 3,000 Nissan Leaf and e-NV200 cars made before 2016 are affected by the app being withdrawn.
These older vehicles are fitted with 2G control units which communicate with the app.
Nissan told the BBC: ""The NissanConnect EV app currently linked to Nissan Leaf and e-NV200 vehicles produced up until 2016 will shut down from 1 April 2024 in preparation of the 2G technology sunset.""
It added: ""Owners will, however, still be able to use key features such as Climate Control Timer and Charging Timer directly from their car's Navigation System.""
Affected drivers have told the BBC of their disappointment - in part because mobile network operators will not be phasing out 2G until the end of the decade.
""I was very surprised,"" said Max Siegieda, a 2013 Nissan Leaf owner in Manchester.
""I would have expected at least six months, 12 months, something like that to arrange alternatives. This is a key feature of the car that's going away.""
He said the app's remote access for features such as heating the car or charging remotely at cheaper times was ""a major selling point"" when he bought the car second-hand in 2022.
He was already considering upgrading but now says he would be ""reluctant"" to buy another Nissan ""because of the lack of notice"" they gave about the app shutdown.

David Morris, who has a 2014 Nissan Leaf, received an email on Wednesday which said his app will stop working next month.
""When you buy a car you expect to have support for it for at least 10 years,"" he told BBC News.
""Would I buy another one again, from this manufacturer, if they're not going to support it for a long term? Not sure,"" Mr Morris said.
Though this issue affects a relatively small number of drivers, experts predict many more vehicle owners will encounter similar problems in the future.
Dr Benjamin Gorman, a senior lecturer at Bournemouth University, said Nissan ""really should have built in some kind of backward compatibility"" so that the car could still connect by plugging in a phone or through Bluetooth, adding that ""it is bad design.""
But he said, in the future, other electric vehicle owners could also see their software eventually lose functionality as technology moved on, and companies stopped issuing updates.
He also pointed to broader trends within the industry, such as some car manufacturers starting to charge a monthly subscription fee for access to extra features such as apps.
""I think it's going to be a much wider issue, because essentially, manufacturers are increasingly moving to selling hardware as a service,"" said Dr Gorman.
However, Sam Sheehan, motoring editor at car firm Cinch, said it was important to keep the problem in perspective, with this case having a lot to do with the Leaf being a trailblazer.
""It was initially the only mass-market EV [electric vehicle] on sale, which means the connected software it uses is very old,"" he told the BBC.
Mr Sheehan predicts that while newer cars will eventually lose some functionality as technology moves on it's likely they will ""stay working for much, much longer than the first Leaf's ancient tech.""

2024-02-04T07:40:10.000Z,Facebook at 20: Four ways the app changed the world,BBC News,"Look at the image above. This is how Facebook, or The Facebook as it was then known, looked when Mark Zuckerberg and a handful of friends launched it from their student digs 20 years ago.
Since then, the world's most popular social network has been redesigned dozens of times.
But its aim has remained the same: to connect people online. And make mountains of money from advertising.
As the platform turns 20, here are four ways Facebook has changed the world.
Other social networks, such as MySpace, existed before Facebook - but Mark Zuckerberg's site instantly took off when it launched in 2004, proving just how rapidly an online site of this kind could take hold.
In less than a year it had one million users, and within four years it had overtaken MySpace - fuelled by innovations such as the ability to ""tag"" people in photos.
Taking a digital camera on a night out, then tagging your friends in dozens of pictures was a staple of teenage life in the late noughties. The constantly changing activity feed was also a big draw for early users.
By 2012, Facebook had surpassed one billion users a month and, aside from a brief blip at the end of 2021 - when daily active users dropped for the first time - the platform has continued to grow.
By expanding into less connected countries and offering free internet, the company has maintained and increased the number of Facebook users. At the end of 2023, Facebook reported it had 2.11 billion daily users.
Admittedly, Facebook is less popular than it used to be with young people. Nonetheless, it remains the most popular social network in the world, and has ushered in a new era of social activity online.
Some see Facebook and its rivals as empowering tools for connectivity. Others see them as addictive agents of destruction.
Facebook proved that collecting our likes and dislikes is extremely lucrative.
These days, Facebook's parent company Meta is an advertising giant which, alongside the likes of Google, takes the lion's share of global advertising money.
On Thursday Meta reported more than $40bn (£32bn) in revenue for the last quarter of 2023, chiefly from offering advertisers highly targeted ad services. Some $14bn was declared as profit.
But Facebook has also shown where data collection can go awry.
Meta has been fined multiple times for mishandling personal data.
The most publicised case was the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2014, which led to Facebook paying $725m to settle legal action due to a significant data breach.
In 2022, Facebook also paid a €265m (£228m) EU fine for allowing personal data to be extracted from the site.
And last year, the company was issued with a record €1.2bn fine by the Irish Data Protection Commission, for transferring European users' data outside of the jurisdiction. Facebook is currently appealing against the fine.
By offering targeted advertising, Facebook has become a major platform for election campaigning around the world.
For example, in the five months leading up to the US presidential election of 2020, incumbent President Donald Trump's team spent more than $40m on Facebook adverts, according to Statista research.
Facebook has had a hand in changing grassroots politics too - by enabling disparate groups of users to gather, campaign and plan action on a global scale.
Facebook and Twitter were said to be crucial during the Arab Spring in helping to co-ordinate protests and spread the news about what was happening on the ground.
But the adoption of Facebook for political ends has been criticised for some of its consequences, including its impact on human rights. In 2018, Facebook agreed with a UN report that said it had failed to prevent people using the platform to ""incite offline violence"" against Rohingya people in Myanmar.
With the huge success of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg built a social network and technology empire that remains unprecedented in terms of users and its consequent power.
Up-and-coming companies, including WhatsApp, Instagram and Oculus, were all purchased and turbo-charged under the umbrella company Facebook, which changed its name to Meta in 2021.
Meta now says more than three billion people use at least one of its products every day.
And when it hasn't been able to buy its rivals, Meta has often been accused of copying them - in order to maintain its dominance.
Facebook and Instagram's disappearing Stories feature is similar to a key feature found on Snapchat; Instagram Reels is the company's answer to the challenge posed by video-sharing app TikTok; and Threads is Meta's attempt to imitate X, formerly known as Twitter.
Tactics have become more important than ever, thanks to the increased competition and a more strict regulatory environment.
In 2022, Meta was forced to sell GIF-maker Giphy at a loss after UK regulators blocked it from owning the service due to fears of over-dominance in the market.
From poking to privacy scandals, some of the highs and lows of Facebook from the last two decades.
Watch now on BBC iPlayer
Facebook's rise and continued dominance is testament to Mark Zuckerberg's ability to keep the site relevant.
On its 10th anniversary many outlets, including the BBC, questioned whether the platform would still be around for its 20th.
Naysayers will hesitate now before asking when its time might finally be up.
But the reality is maintaining its crown as the most popular social network will be a monumental challenge over the next 20 years.
That's not just because the industry, as always, is changing at breakneck speed - but because Meta itself is now pushing heavily towards building its business around the idea of the Metaverse.
Artificial intelligence is also a big priority for Meta.
The company is therefore, to some extent, moving on from Facebook. Whether the world is, given its enduring popularity, is another matter.

2024-01-05T12:46:42.000Z,Tesla recalls more than 1.6 million cars in China over steering software issues,BBC News,"Tesla is recalling more than 1.6 million vehicles in China over issues with steering software and door-locking systems, the country's regulator says.
The recall includes its models S, X, 3 and Y, and 7,538 imported vehicles.
The problems will be fixed by remote updates to software, meaning the vehicles will not need to be taken to dealerships or garages.
It comes less than a month after Tesla recalled two million cars in the US due to autopilot software issues.
In May last year, the Chinese regulator said more than a million vehicles may have acceleration and braking system issues.
The American electric car giant then discovered problems with assisted driving functions and door-locking systems.
The Chinese regulator, the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR), described the planned vehicle update as a recall, even though it will happen remotely.
Tesla will release an over-the-air software update for a total of 1,610,105 vehicles, including imported Models S and X and the China-made Models 3 and Y cars made from 2014 to 2023, the SAMR said.
The regulator added that this was to tackle issues with the autosteer function and cut the risk of collision.
""For vehicles within the scope of this recall, when the automatic assisted steering function is turned on, the driver may misuse the level two combined assisted driving function, increasing the risk of vehicle collision and posing a safety hazard,"" the SAMR explained.
Separately, Tesla will also upgrade the software for 7,538 units of Models S and X cars to fix the problem of doors that could unlock in crashes.
This is the second recent blow for Tesla in the country, after China's BYD overtook Tesla's electric car sales worldwide in the last quarter of 2023.
Another similar move in 2022 saw Tesla recall nearly 128,000 cars in China over a rear motor inverter defect.
Tesla has a large consumer market in China - where people have been encouraged to buy electric and hybrid vehicles through subsidies. The country aims to have a majority of cars powered with clean energy by 2035.
China also hosts a major manufacturing plant in Shanghai, which is Tesla's first ""gigafactory"" to be built abroad. The facility delivered 947,000 vehicles in 2023, according to state news agency Xinhua.

A licensing agreement between TikTok and the label expired on Wednesday, and a new deal could not be reached.
UMG said TikTok wanted to pay a ""fraction"" of the rate other social media sites do for access to its songs.
TikTok accused UMG of presenting a ""false narrative and rhetoric"".
All videos which have UMG music on them will be muted and new videos will not be able to be made with those tracks.
Some artists such as Ariana Grande and Katy Perry have had most of their music disappear from their official pages, except a few songs which are on other labels.
Billie Eilish, another UMG artist, has had all but one of her songs taken down.
Her song What Was I Made For? was featured in the Barbie movie - whose soundtrack was published by Warner Music Group.
Sophie Ellis-Bextor's Murder on the Dancefloor, which became a viral hit after appearing in the film Saltburn, is also unavailable.
Unofficial, sped-up and slowed-down versions of tracks are still available to use.
Noah Kahan, whose number one song Stick Season started as a viral TikTok clip, posted a video on his account saying he was unable to promote his new song on the platform.
""I can't stick it down your throats any more on this app,"" he said.
""I'll probably be OK, right? I'll land on my feet, right?""
Meanwhile Cody Fry, an artist signed to a record label owned by UMG, said in a TikTok video he felt ""like a person standing between two colliding planets"" - having seen reports about the licensing agreement expiring as one of his tracks was going viral in China.
The 33-year-old musician told the BBC he did not even have a TikTok account when his song, I Hear A Symphony, went viral on the platform in 2021, several years after it was first released.
He added that he thought TikTok should ""value music more than it does currently"" and he wished the two giants could have resolved differences without ""leaving it to the expense of artists on the ground"".
""I don't know much about the mechanics of these massive corporate negotiations,"" he said, ""but I'd be remiss if I didn't express the frustration about how this was handled on behalf of myself, and I think Universal's artists, because to find out something like this on the news, it's pretty tough.""
Music companies and artists earn royalty payments when their songs are played on streaming and social media platforms.
On TikTok, they are used as backing music to the videos uploaded to the site.
But there has long been unease about how little the platforms pay, which in this case developed into a major and very public disagreement.
UMG and TikTok were in talks over a new deal, but were unable to agree one before the 31 January deadline.
In an open letter, published on 30 January, Universal claimed that ""ultimately TikTok is trying to build a music-based business, without paying fair value for the music"".
Universal said it was also concerned about getting artists fair compensation for AI-generated songs made to sound like real artists - such as one made to sound like Drake and The Weeknd which went viral.
""Content creators already compete on social media platforms with diluted or non-existing royalty pools,"" said Franklin Graves, an attorney and author of a newsletter focused on legal developments in the creator economy.
""By throwing an additional licensing payment for AI-generated music into the mix, it could potentially decrease any ad revenue share left after TikTok's cut and rights holders are paid,"" he added.
Universal also had issues with TikTok's content moderation, saying it failed to adequately deal with ""the tidal wave of hate speech, bigotry, bullying and harassment on the platform"".
TikTok responded: ""It is sad and disappointing that Universal Music Group has put their own greed above the interests of their artists and songwriters.
""Despite Universal's false narrative and rhetoric, the fact is they have chosen to walk away from the powerful support of a platform with well over a billion users that serves as a free promotional and discovery vehicle for their talent,"" it added.
Universal's rival Warner Music agreed a licensing deal with TikTok in July 2023.

A far-left activist group says it targeted the site because of the amount of resources and labour it uses.
The company says car-making is unlikely to resume before next week, with the outage likely to cost it ""in the high nine-digit euro range.""
Tesla wants to double the size of its German factory - a plan which is opposed by some environmentalists.
In a post on X, formerly Twitter, Mr Musk used the German phrase ""extrem dumm"" - extremely stupid - to describe the targeting of the site.
""These are either the dumbest eco-terrorists on Earth or they're puppets of those who don't have good environmental goals,"" he wrote.
In a letter published online, activists calling themselves the Volcano Group said they sabotaged production.
An electricity pylon close to the plant caught fire, causing power outages in the factory and nearby towns.
Tesla said workers had been sent home but its building was in a ""safe state"".
The fire did not reach the electric car-maker's factory itself but did burn an electricity pylon and high-voltage wires.
In its letter claiming responsibility for the attack, the Volcano Group said it sabotaged Tesla because it ate up resources and labour.
It also accused Tesla of contaminating groundwater and using huge amounts of drinking water.
State police have told the BBC they are currently examining the letter.
""The rule of law will react to such an act of sabotage with the utmost severity,"" said Interior Minister for Brandenburg state Michael Stuebgen after the attack took place on Tuesday morning.
Some environmentalists are unhappy with the Berlin expansion plan because it would involve chopping down nearby trees.
Around 100 people are camping in a forest near the factory. However, those green activists have distanced themselves from what has happened.
One group, which calls itself Robin Wood, told the BBC it had ""nothing to do with the fire"".
The Tesla factory currently makes around 500,000 cars a year - the Elon Musk-owned company wants to double that.
Production is not expected to restart until next week, according to plant manager Andre Thierig.
He added that the outage would cost ""in the high nine-digit Euro range"" after both power lines into the plant were broken.

Character.ai did not say how many individual users that is for the bot, but says 3.5 million people visit the overall site daily.
The bot has been described as ""someone who helps with life difficulties"".
The San Francisco Bay area firm played down its popularity, arguing that users are more interested in role-playing for entertainment. The most popular bots are anime or computer game characters like Raiden Shogun, which has been sent 282 million messages.
However, few of the millions of characters are as popular as Psychologist, and in total there are 475 bots with ""therapy"", ""therapist"", ""psychiatrist"" or ""psychologist"" in their names which are able to talk in several languages.
Some of them are what you could describe as entertainment or fantasy therapists like Hot Therapist. But the most popular are mental health helpers like Therapist which has had 12 million messages, or Are you feeling OK?, which has received 16.5 million.
Psychologist is by far the most popular mental health character,  with many users sharing glowing reviews on social media site Reddit.
""It's a lifesaver,"" posted one person.
""It's helped both me and my boyfriend talk about and figure out our emotions,"" shared another.
The user behind Blazeman98 is 30-year-old Sam Zaia from New Zealand.
""I never intended for it to become popular, never intended it for other people to seek or to use as like a tool,"" he says.
""Then I started getting a lot of messages from people saying that they had been really positively affected by it and were utilising it as a source of comfort.""
The psychology student says he trained the bot using principles from his degree by talking to it and shaping the answers it gives to the most common mental health conditions, like depression and anxiety.
He created it for himself when his friends were busy and he needed, in his words, ""someone or something"" to talk to, and human therapy was too expensive.
Sam has been so surprised by the success of the bot that he is working on a post-graduate research project about the emerging trend of AI therapy and why it appeals to young people. Character.ai is dominated by users aged 16 to 30.
""So many people who've messaged me say they access it when their thoughts get hard, like at 2am when they can't really talk to any friends or a real therapist,""
Sam also guesses that the text format is one with which young people are most comfortable.
""Talking by text is potentially less daunting than picking up the phone or having a face-to-face conversation,"" he theorises.
Theresa Plewman is a professional psychotherapist and has tried out Psychologist. She says she is not surprised this type of therapy is popular with younger generations, but questions its effectiveness.
""The bot has a lot to say and quickly makes assumptions, like giving me advice about depression when I said I was feeling sad. That's not how a human would respond,"" she said.
Theresa says the bot fails to gather all the information a human would and is not a competent therapist. But she says its immediate and spontaneous nature might be useful to people who need help.
She says the number of people using the bot is worrying and could point to high levels of mental ill health and a lack of public resources.
Character.ai is an odd place for a therapeutic revolution to take place. A spokeswoman for the company said: ""We are happy to see people are finding great support and connection through the characters they, and the community, create, but users should consult certified professionals in the field for legitimate advice and guidance.""
The company says chat logs are private to users but that conversations can be read by staff if there is a need to access them, for example, for safeguarding reasons.
Every conversation also starts with a warning in red letters that says: ""Remember, everything characters say is made up.""
It is a reminder that the underlying technology called a Large Language Model (LLM) is not thinking in the same way a human does. LLMs act like predicted text messages by stringing words together in ways in which they are most likely to appear in other writing on which the AI has been trained.
Other LLM-based AI services offer similar companionship such as Replika, but that site is rated mature because of its sexual nature and, according to data from analytics company Similarweb, is not as popular as Character.ai in terms of time spent and visits.
Earkick and Woebot are AI chatbots designed from the ground up to act as mental health companions, with both firms claiming their research shows the apps are helping people.
Some psychologists warn that AI bots may be giving poor advice to patients, or have ingrained biases against race or gender.
But elsewhere the medical world is starting to tentatively accept them as tools to be used to help cope with high demands on public services.
Last year an AI service called Limbic Access became the first mental health chatbot to secure a UK medical device certification by the government. It is now used in many NHS trusts to classify and triage patients.

2024-02-13T17:47:55.000Z,Ransomware attack hits dozens of Romanian hospitals,BBC News,"Over a hundred Romanian healthcare facilities have been been affected by a ransomware attack, with some doctors forced to resort to pen and paper.
Children's and emergency hospitals were among those hit, with other facilities going offline as a precaution.
The cyber extortionists demanded 3.5 Bitcoin, worth over £130,000, to unlock vital files which they had encrypted.
But Romanian cyber officials said data had been recently backed up, reducing the impact.
The attack largely unfolded overnight on Monday, according to a statement from the Romanian Ministry of Health and had targeted a widely used medical information system.
The incident was under investigation by IT specialists, including cyber security experts from the National Cyber Security Directorate (DNSC), the ministry said.
According to the DNSC, 25 hospitals were affected by the attack, starting with the The Pitesti Paediatric Hospital.
The organisation said that 79 other healthcare facilities were taken offline while investigations were carried out to determine if they had been affected.
While officials had identified the type of malware used, the group responsible has yet to be identified. The ransom demand includes only an email address, officials wrote.
As most of the targeted hospitals have recent backups of data from the affected servers, it is expected that the facilities should be able to bounce back fairly rapidly.
But the impact on patients is likely to be profound as dozens more hospitals have had to switch off internet connected devices as a precaution. This could, in theory, affect not just booking and records but also machines like MRI scanners.
The UK experienced a similar attack in 2017 which disrupted 80 out of 236 hospital trusts across England and caused nearly 7000 appointments to be cancelled or rearranged.
Following that incident the NHS accepted that there were ""lessons to be learned"", and made a number of changes.

2024-01-23T15:56:25.000Z,China appears to U-turn on 'obsessive' gaming crackdown,BBC News,"China seems to have backtracked on strict rules to combat what the regulator deemed ""obsessive"" gaming.
The National Press and Publication Administration (NPPA) had proposed regulations limiting the amount of money and time people spent playing video games.
However, on Tuesday the draft rules were no longer on the NPPA website.
China is the world's biggest online gaming market, but the industry has had frequent run-ins with the authorities.
The new rules would have limited in-game purchases. Incentives such as daily log-in rewards for gamers would also have come under fire, while the introduction of a pop-up warning players of ""irrational"" behaviour was proposed.
Share prices of Chinese gaming firms - including the world's biggest gaming company Tencent Holdings and its rival NetEase - jumped after the apparent U-turn.
They had plummeted after the rules were first proposed in December, wiping nearly $80bn (£63bn) off the value of the two companies.
However, analysts say the sector is still clouded by uncertainty about what the government might do next.
""I think this type of sentiment will probably last for quite some time, unless we get a very drastic turnaround in government rhetoric, or unless we get some super supportive policies,"" said Ivan Su, senior analyst at Morningstar.
""We don't know if it's going to happen in a week, in a couple months, or in a couple of years.""
China's largest crackdown on gamers came in 2021 when children were banned from playing for more than an hour on certain days.
That same year, the government stopped gaming licences from being granted for eight months.
As a result, says Mr Su, ""a lot of Chinese developers have started shifting their development pipeline toward overseas games"".
NetEase and Tencent acquired or invested in companies in the likes of France, Japan and the United States.
It remains to be seen whether the current uncertainty will prompt another wave of overseas expansion.

2024-01-10T22:01:10.000Z,Bitcoin: Crypto fans can now invest in exchange-traded funds - but what are they?,BBC News,"The US has made the long-awaited decision to allow Bitcoin to be part of mainstream investing funds.
It has approved what are known as spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which can be purchased by anyone from pension funds to ordinary investors.
The announcement from the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission was accompanied by a stern warning about risks associated with the asset.
But cryptocurrency fans reacted with glee - and memes about becoming rich.
The US financial watchdog had repeatedly rebuffed earlier requests for approvals, citing concerns about potential for fraud and manipulation.
But a US court said last year its justification was inadequate.
The go-ahead comes after a false start on Tuesday, when the regulator had to rapidly withdraw an ""unauthorised"" post announcing the decision early.
SEC chairman Gary Gensler said on Wednesday that investors should not mistake the new approvals for an endorsement of the cryptocurrency.
""Bitcoin is primarily a speculative, volatile asset that's also used for illicit activity including ransomware, money laundering, sanction evasion, and terrorist financing,"" he said.
""Investors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto.""
ETFs are portfolios that allow investors to bet on multiple assets, without having to buy any themselves.
Traded on stock exchanges like shares, their value depends on how the overall portfolio performs in real time.
An ETF could comprise a combination of gold and silver bullion, for example, or a mixture of shares in both top technology and insurance companies.
Some ETFs already contain Bitcoin indirectly - but a spot Bitcoin ETF will buy the cryptocurrency directly, ""on the spot"", at its current price, throughout the day.
About a dozen investment companies, including Blackrock and Fidelity, have been waiting for months for the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to give them the green light to start buying Bitcoin for their own ETFs.
And after weeks of wrangling over wording, the first have now been given the nod.
This means a new group of investors can now enter the speculative world of Bitcoin, without having to worry about getting digital wallets or navigating crypto exchanges.
Billions of dollars are expected to pour into the Bitcoin market, as these financial companies start buying the digital coin.
A minority of analysts say the cryptocurrency's price will be little affected, as spot Bitcoin ETFs are already established in other countries.
But with the US giants entering the market, most people are expecting the value of bitcoins to rise with demand.
The price is notoriously volatile, however.
It rose to nearly $70,000 (£55,000) a coin in 2021, before falling to $16,000 in 2022 as scandals shook the industry.
But in 2023, it rose steadily, partly due to the hype around the Bitcoin ETF approval, and is now at $44,000.
Based on an idea published online in 2008, by someone calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency and remains the most valuable and famous.
Its price is often seen as a barometer for the whole industry of thousands of other coins, tokens and products built on the same blockchain technology.
And with an influx of new money into the ecosystem, many expect a surge in interest in cryptocurrency technology in general.
Some say this landmark decision shows the establishment is finally taking Bitcoin seriously, at least as a speculative asset.
For those who consider Bitcoin legitimate ""digital gold"", what better proof could there be than the biggest wealth-management institutions flocking to buy, overseen by regulators?
Others say cryptocurrency is about rejecting traditional financial systems in favour of a decentralised, people-powered alternative. And investment bankers buying Bitcoin just to get rich on US dollars is not what Satoshi Nakamoto had in mind.
But judging from the excitement on social media, the prevailing sentiment is hope the cash injection will make existing Bitcoin investors rich.
The price of Bitcoin can change rapidly and often without warning or explanation.
So investors will have to weigh that up when they opt for ETFs linked to the digital coin.
But ETFs are often sold as high-risk, high-reward products anyway.
Another potential risk is cyber-crime.
Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have been subject to huge and costly attacks that have seen crypto companies drained of sometimes hundreds of millions of dollars overnight.
And if the likes of Blackrock become major holders of Bitcoin, their cyber-security will be tested in ways to which they are unaccustomed.
Another downside is the cost to the environment.
Bitcoin relies on a huge number of powerful computers around the world, to process transactions and create coins.
Renewable energy use is growing - but it remains to be seen how investment companies can square the potential environmental cost of Bitcoin with buyers worried about environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) compliance.

2024-02-13T13:09:03.000Z,BBC iPlayer to end programme downloads for PCs and Macs,BBC News,"The BBC's iPlayer streaming service is to end downloads for users who watch on desktop or laptop computers.
Programmes will still be available to download on tablets and phones via the mobile iPlayer app.
Currently viewers on PCs and Macs can save programmes via the iPlayer Downloads app, but that will be closed.
The changes were ""due to the low number of people using it and the cost required to keep it going"" the BBC said.
""This does not affect downloads on the BBC iPlayer mobile or tablet apps and viewers can continue to stream programmes on BBC iPlayer on their PCs and Macs,"" a spokesperson added.
The BBC has published a timeline of the planned changes:
The corporation declined to reveal how many people would be affected by the closure of downloads for users of desktops and laptops, but the decision has attracted some criticism.
One user, Steve Gerrard, posted on X (formerly Twitter): ""This is terrible news. I watch almost all my BBC shows on my MacBook.""
Former BBC Journalist Robert Rea wrote: ""This strikes me as a very bad move. Why would you want to make it harder to watch your programmes?""
Cord Busters, a site that covers streaming TV and first reported the change, noted that ""some users have expressed regret that they were not even aware of the feature's existence until now"".
Figures released last year show traditional TV viewing had its sharpest ever decline in 2022, according to the latest annual survey of UK media consumption by broadcasting watchdog Ofcom.
But the BBC has been keen to highlight ""record"" growth in digital services.
iPlayer now accounts for 18% of the BBC's total viewing, Ofcom found.

2024-01-30T10:38:38.000Z,Elon Musk says Neuralink implanted wireless brain chip,BBC News,"Tech billionaire Elon Musk has claimed his Neuralink company has successfully implanted one of its wireless brain chips in a human.
In a post on X, formerly Twitter, he said ""promising"" brain activity had been detected after the procedure and the patient was ""recovering well"".
The company's goal is to connect human brains to computers to help tackle complex neurological conditions.
A number of rival firms have already implanted similar devices.
""For any company producing medical devices, the first test in humans is a significant milestone,"" said Professor Anne Vanhoestenberghe of King's College London.
""For the brain computer interface community, we must place this news in the context that whilst there are many companies working on exciting products, there are only a few other companies who have implanted their devices in humans, so Neuralink has joined a rather small group.""
However, she also suggested there needed to be a note of caution as ""true success"" could only be evaluated in the long-term.
""We know Elon Musk is very adept at generating publicity for his company,"" she added.
Among the other companies to make similar advances in the field is the École Polytechnique Fédérale in Lausanne (EPFL), in Switzerland, which has successfully enabled a paralysed man to walk just by thinking.
That was achieved by putting electronic implants on his brain and spine which wirelessly communicate thoughts to his legs and feet.
Details of the breakthrough were published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature in May 2023.
There has been no independent verification of Mr Musk's claims, nor has Neuralink provided any information about the procedure he says has taken place.
BBC News has approached both Neuralink and the US's medical regulator, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), for comment.
Neuralink has been criticised in the past, with Reuters reporting in December 2022 that the company engaged in testing which resulted in the deaths of approximately 1,500 animals, including sheep, monkeys and pigs.
In July 2023, the head of the US Department of Agriculture - which investigates animal welfare concerns - said it had not found any violations of animal research rules at the firm.
However, a separate investigation by the agency is ongoing.
Mr Musk's company was given permission to test the chip on humans by the FDA in May 2023.
That gave the green light for the start of the six-year study during which a robot is being used to surgically place 64 flexible threads, thinner than a human hair, on to a part of the brain that controls ""movement intention"", according to Neuralink.
The company says that these threads allow its experimental implant - powered by a battery that can be charged wirelessly - to record and transmit brain signals wirelessly to an app that decodes how the person intends to move.
""[It] has great potential to help people with neurological disorders in future and is an excellent example of how fundamental neuroscience research is being harnessed for medical advances,"" said Professor Tara Spires-Jones, president of the British Neuroscience Association.
""However, most of these interfaces require invasive neurosurgery and are still in experimental stages thus it will likely be many years before they are commonly available.""
In another post on X, Mr Musk said Neuralink's first product would be called Telepathy.
Telepathy, he said, would enable ""control of your phone or computer, and through them almost any device, just by thinking"".
""Initial users will be those who have lost the use of their limbs,"" he continued.
Referring to the late British scientist who had motor neurone disease, he added: ""Imagine if Stephen Hawking could communicate faster than a speed typist or auctioneer. That is the goal.""
While Mr Musk's involvement raises the profile of Neuralink, some of his rivals have a track record dating back two decades. Utah-based Blackrock Neurotech implanted its first of many brain-computer interfaces in 2004.
Precision Neuroscience, formed by a Neuralink co-founder, also aims to help people with paralysis. And its implant resembles a very thin piece of tape that sits on the surface of the brain and can be implanted via a ""cranial micro-slit"", which it says is a much simpler procedure.
Existing devices have also generated results. In two separate recent US scientific studies, implants were used to monitor brain activity when a person tried to speak, which could then be decoded to help them communicate.

2024-01-22T14:47:29.000Z,Elon Musk visits site of Auschwitz death camp,BBC News,"Tech billionaire Elon Musk has visited the site of the Auschwitz death camp.
The visit comes after intense criticism of how X, formerly Twitter, tackles antisemitic posts and just weeks after Mr Musk apologised for endorsing an antisemitic conspiracy theory.
Prominent Jewish leaders called for Mr Musk to see for himself one of the most symbolic sites of the Holocaust.
Later he will address online antisemitism at a conference hosted by the European Jewish Association (EJA).
Nazi Germany murdered at least 1.1 million people in the Auschwitz death camp in occupied Poland during World War Two. Almost one million were Jews. The museum notes more than 200,000 were children and young people.
Mr Musk laid a wreath and participated in a memorial service, including lighting a candle, during a private visit to the site.
Photos showed him there with his son on his shoulders and standing next to Holocaust survivor Gidon Lev.
As a result of the fall-out over Mr Musk's enthusiastic agreement with an antisemitic post, Apple, Disney and IBM paused ads on X.
In response, the entrepreneur has accused advertisers of attempting to ""blackmail"" him with money, and used expletive filled language to express his disdain for their actions.
The Tesla boss, who took over the platform in October 2022, faced accusations of antisemitism in November when he replied, ""You have said the actual truth"" to a post on X that made the false claim that Jewish communities push hatred against white people.
The White House immediately condemned his post, which drew anger online.
Mr Musk said the endorsement was a mistake, describing it as ""one of the most foolish"" things he had done on the platform.
Later in November Mr Musk joined Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on a tour of the Kfar Aza kibbutz targeted by Hamas as part of the 7 October attacks in which about 1,200 people were killed and about 240 taken back to Gaza as hostages.
Today, senior political figures from European countries and Mr Musk will meet in Krakow, Poland ""to discuss and find solutions to the astronomical rises in antisemitism affecting Europe,"" the EJA said.
""This troubling trend"" had been escalating since the war in Gaza, it said.
During a live discussion broadcast on X in September, EJA chairman Rabbi Menachem Margolin invited Mr Musk to visit Auschwitz.
Rabbi Margolin said it would be ""a very strong statement"" and ""could contribute a lot to Holocaust awareness and the struggle to combat antisemitism"".
They were gassed, starved, worked to death and killed in medical experiments.
The Memorial and Museum Auschwitz-Birkenau has previously been critical of X.
In August, the museum criticised the platform after it had initially failed to remove a post denying the Holocaust, saying it did not break its rules.
The offensive post was a reply to one from the museum about a three-year-old Jewish girl murdered in the camp's gas chambers.
The post called her death a ""fairy tale"" and used antisemitic tropes.
According to a post on X by the museum, it had reported the offensive reply but received a response saying that after viewing the ""available information"" the platform had decided no rules had been broken.
That initial response to the museum's complaint, according to X, was down to a mistake during the first review - it was escalated and removed in a second review.
X's policies state that Holocaust denial is prohibited.
Shortly after publication of an article about the incident, a museum spokesperson told the BBC that moderation was vital in tackling antisemitism but there seemed to be ""a problem on X in the quality of moderating and responding to reports"".
But the Tesla boss has strongly defended his record in combating online hate.
In his discussion with Rabbi Margolin, Mr Musk said it was absurd that he was accused of antisemitism ""when all the evidence points the other direction and my entire life story is in fact pro-semitic.""
He previously threatened to file a suit against the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish advocacy group, over its claims that problematic and racist speech has soared on the site since his takeover.
X is also currently suing non-profit Media Matters after it accused the site of allowing antisemitic posts next to advertising. X's lawsuit alleges it used ""manipulated"" data in an attempt to ""destroy"" the platform.
Correction 13th February: This article wrongly reported that about 1,300 people had been killed following the 7th October attack by Hamas. This was based on counting those who later died from their injuries in addition to the figure of more than 1,200. The article has been amended to now refer to about 1,200 deaths, a figure which includes those deaths and which Israel says is not final.

2024-01-30T22:00:33.000Z,'I regret posting online that I was Madeleine McCann',BBC News,"When Julia Wandelt posted on social media that she believed she was Madeleine McCann, she became a lightning rod for online anger. In the first of a new series of stories exploring extraordinary cases of online hate and the possibility of forgiveness, Julia reveals for the first time her motives and regrets.
As Julia Wandelt plays guitar to me in her bedroom in Poland, we're surrounded by teddy bears. One is bright pink, wearing a T-shirt that reads: ""You Got This!""
It was a gift, the 22-year-old says, from some of her new followers. She got to know them after creating an Instagram account called @iammadeleinemccan - referring to the British girl who went missing in Portugal in 2007 but missing the final ""n"" from her surname.
Madeleine McCann's disappearance at the age of three - which remains unsolved - is one of the most widely reported in history. Online communities of obsessives have grown up around the case, and Julia's account was like petrol thrown onto a fire already burning across social media sites like Instagram, TikTok and X.
""I never meant to hurt anyone - including [the] McCanns,"" she told me. ""I really wanted to know who I am.""
If she were to go back in time, Julia says she would never have made the Madeleine McCann profile.
""I would never go on social media. It can destroy you,"" she explained.
For a BBC Radio 4 podcast series called Why Do You Hate Me?, I'm tracking down deep-fakers, conspiracy theorists, impersonators and those harmed online, to find out why some people behave the way they do on social media.
I'm starting with Julia, because her case seemed to be one of the most extraordinary I'd spotted.
The original account she posted on as Madeleine at the start of 2023 no longer exists. But among the online groups of Madeleine McCann obsessives was one dedicated to analysing Julia's social media posts, which is where I found her personal account.
After I messaged her, Julia told me she wanted to share her side of the story. Because she has spoken openly about her past struggles with her mental health, we chatted multiple times on the phone over several weeks, as well as meeting in person - so we could be confident she was making an informed decision about speaking out.
We first met at her flat in Poland. As I arrived, I was greeted by a loud meow from Julia's cat Monty. Now, rather than posting about the Madeleine McCann case, Julia shares videos of him doing tricks.
So, who exactly is Julia? And why did she post on social media that she was Madeleine? Julia says what happened had its roots in a traumatic childhood.
Why Do You Hate Me?
One of the BBC's most trolled journalists, Marianna Spring, dives into her inbox and investigates extraordinary cases of online hate. She meets the people at the heart of these conflicts, and in some cases brings them together, to see if understanding - even forgiveness - is ever possible.
Listen now on BBC Sounds or watch on BBC iPlayer.
She says she was isolated at school and that as a young child she was sexually abused.
Music became her escape, she says. From time to time as we talk, she picks up her guitar and sings an improvised song. ""It's still the way to deal with difficulties in my life,"" Julia says.
Later, aged about 20, she was in therapy and started to realise her memories from childhood were patchy - with chunks of time where she couldn't remember much at all.
Psychiatrists and psychologists I've spoken to say it's common to experience memory loss if you've been abused. It's the brain's way of protecting us, they say.
Julia started to wonder if the blanks in her memory might hide a big secret - that maybe she had been adopted. She began to ask her relatives to help fill in the gaps.
""For example, can you show me some pictures from childhood? Can you show me your pregnancy photos?"" Julia says.
She says her family dismissed her concerns that she might be adopted, and wouldn't answer her questions. That only served to fuel her suspicions.
Julia began to wonder whether there was an even more disturbing reason for their defensiveness. Could she have been kidnapped?
Frustrated by her family's silence, Julia turned to the internet for answers. She started googling missing persons websites from her bedroom.
That was when she found Madeleine's case. Julia told me she had never heard of her disappearance before, since it had not been such a big news story in Poland.
On the profiles of missing people there are sometimes sketches or e-fits of potential suspects - and Julia thought she recognised one of the men on Madeleine's profile.
""I know [what] my abuser looks like. And I know this is very, very similar to the suspects from [the] Madeleine McCann page.""
Julia's mind went into overdrive. Given Julia now suspected she may not belong in her family, this felt like the answer she had been looking for. And when she noticed an unusual physical resemblance between her and Madeleine, it seemed to confirm she was right.
Both Julia and Madeleine have a coloboma of the iris - a rare eye abnormality that affects one in every 10,000 babies. It's a gap in the iris that can make the pupil look keyhole-shaped. Sitting opposite her, I could see this was the case.
So Julia contacted the police in Poland and the UK. ""I called them so many times,"" she tells me. ""But no-one treated me seriously.""
Over the years, several young women and girls have come forward claiming to have been Madeleine McCann, but all have proven to be false.
Julia didn't feel listened to by anyone, so she says she turned to social media to see if people would pay attention there.
She was very open with her followers, telling them she had been abused as a child, her struggles with depression and difficulties in coping with the attention she had unleashed.
""I was looking at what people write, what they say, if they believe me or if they will ignore me,"" she said.
Almost immediately Julia was engulfed by a whole new community online who offered support, validation and even gifts - flowers, bracelets, teddies and blankets - one for her and one for her cat.
A girl with few friends at school had become a young woman who very quickly gathered more than a million followers on her Instagram profile.
""I've never felt the people who support me or who follow me are fans. I always feel that they are just people who are friends,"" she told me.
But social media notoriety also brought criticism and abuse.
""I knew that there will be people who will not believe me or hate me, but I didn't expect that I will get death threats, for example. It was something that I don't understand. People knew that I was abused and they all knew that I deal with depression,"" Julia says.
""I was trying to be strong even when people said, you should die. You should be raped. You should be killed. You should be murdered. You shouldn't exist in this world. You're a bitch.""
One person said she had put a bounty on Julia's head - and offered €30,000 (£25,700) as a reward.
Nonetheless, Julia kept posting. Why?
""I wanted to know the truth. Some people said [I wanted] to be a star. 'She wants to make her music go viral, blah, blah',"" she explained. But she says she never posted her music on her new Madeleine McCann Instagram, and that wasn't her aim.
By March last year, Julia's story had gone global. It attracted the attention of producers in the United States and she was invited to go on the long-running chat show hosted by psychologist Dr Phil.
About that time, Julia decided to take a DNA test. She says neither her parents nor the McCanns agreed to provide DNA samples for Julia's to be compared against. But when the results arrived, they showed that Julia was from Poland, with some Lithuanian and Romanian heritage. In other words, she is not Madeleine McCann.
Her family said at the time in a statement: ''For us as a family it is obvious that Julia is our daughter, granddaughter, sister, niece, cousin and step-niece. We have memories, we have pictures. We always tried to understand all the situations that happened with Julia.""
While some followers turned on her after the results of the DNA test came in, others remained in close contact with her and offered her support. They didn't abandon her - and several continued to follow her for being Julia.
Julia says she posted an apology to the McCanns because she was worried she might have added to their distress.
""I apologised to the McCanns because I don't know them personally. I don't know if they were watching this journey, if they were sad or whatever. And I just wanted to say sorry. Because every person can react in a different way and maybe it brought them more sadness,"" Julia says.
""I didn't want them to feel sad.""
How much did she think about what they had been going through, as parents of a missing child?
""I really wanted to know who I am, and I knew that it could make them feel sad.""
But she says she believed at the time that she might be able to help them find their child.
In light of all that, is understanding - and forgiveness - possible here?
Given how extreme and never-ending the social media conversation has been about this case, anything Madeleine's parents say is likely to trigger more hate and headlines. There's also an active police investigation into Madeleine's disappearance that they are wary not to disrupt.
But I reached out to the Find Madeleine campaign, her family's official search organisation, and people connected to the McCanns.
Those people, who have also been affected by some of Julia's content, told me they are all willing to accept Julia's apology and forgive her for the situation that unfolded online.
According to the Find Madeleine campaign, Kate and Gerry McCann do not use social media, which somewhat shields them from the trolling.
Julia is now at peace with a lot of what has unfolded - the consequences of her own actions and the horrible abuse she received. In a strange way, she says it has helped her.
She is aware that speaking out could trigger more abuse - but for her, it is important to tell her side of the story in her own words.
I got in touch with Instagram, X and Tiktok and none of them responded with a comment about the case. All of the social media sites say publicly they have policies in place to protect users from hate and disinformation.
When Julia first began questioning her identity, she says she was depressed and ""felt that I don't belong here"". Now she tells me: ""I realise that I am strong and I am a fighter and I'm not a weak person.""
Julia turned to social media for community, validation and answers. The online world can be a quick and easy place to find an intense sense of belonging.
But on social media, communities define themselves in opposition to one another and this can trigger hate.
Offline, though, people seem kinder and fairer. They are more open to nuance - and to understanding why people are motivated to behave the way they do.

2024-01-19T17:55:25.000Z,Amazon takeover of iRobot to be blocked by EU,BBC News,"Amazon's takeover of vacuum cleaner maker iRobot is set to be blocked by the European Union's competition watchdog, the BBC understands.
It's a blow to the tech giant, which was previously given the all-clear for the purchase by the UK government's competition watchdog.
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) found that its place in the UK market was ""modest"" and that it already faced several significant rivals.
Amazon declined to comment.
The online giant moved to buy iRobot, maker of the Roomba cleaner, in August 2022 in a takeover deal set to cost $1.7bn (£1.4bn).
It was looking to expand its footprint in the market for smart home appliances.
But regulators are worried that iRobot's tie-up with Amazon could make it difficult for other vacuum-makers to compete, especially if Amazon were to give the Roomba benefits over rivals on its e-commerce site.
The European Commission (EC), which serves as the EU's competition watchdog, opened an investigation into the purchase last July.
The EC has the legal deadline of February 14 to make its decision but the commission's 27 top political leaders will need to reach consensus on the rejection before a final decision can be issued.
iRobot shares tanked 40% in after hours trading after the first reporting of the EU's intentions by the Wall Street Journal.
The takeover by Amazon had been seen as a boon for the firm, as it has struggled with sales declines.
""If the objective is to have more competition in the home robotics sector, this makes no sense,"" said Matt Schruers, president of tech lobbying group Computer and Communications Industry Association.
""Blocking this deal may well leave consumers with fewer options, and regulators cannot sweep that fact under the rug,"" Schruers told Reuters.
Roomba models sell in the region of £1648 in the UK.

2024-01-15T02:11:46.000Z,Pothole reports hit a five-year high in 2023,BBC News,"Potholes caused misery in 2023 on a scale not seen in years, but scientists hope technology like self-healing roads will help rid us of them for good.
Reports of potholes and damage they caused hit five-year highs, according to local governments and the AA.
The AA estimates they may have cost UK drivers as much as £500m in repairs.
Scientists warn climate change will worsen the problem as more wet weather and temperature extremes give an extra battering to the surfaces we drive on.
Almost 630,000 potholes were reported to councils in England, Scotland and Wales between January and November 2023, a five-year high, according to local government data compiled by campaign group Round Our Way following a Freedom of Information request.
Data was only available from 115 out of 208 councils approached, meaning the total number of reported potholes is likely to be much higher.
""Potholes are the bane of many of our lives and put drivers, cyclists and even pedestrians at risk of serious injury,"" says Roger Harding, director of Round Our Way. ""The weather extremes that climate change brings are sadly creating many more of them at a time when cuts mean repairs are already not keeping up.""
A spokesman for the Local Government Association said councils shared the concerns of all road users with the state of our roads and were doing all they could to tackle what they said was a £14bn backlog of road repairs. He also called for more regular and consistent funding.
A Department for Transport spokesperson said: ""We're taking decisive action to fix potholes and resurface roads by investing an extra £8.3bn of redirected HS2 funding, the biggest ever funding increase for local road improvements and enough to resurface over 5,000 miles of roads across the country.""
The AA said it dealt with 631,852 pothole-related incidents related to tyres, wheels, steering, and suspension last year - another five-year high according to the organisation.
With an average repair cost for a pothole accident being £250, the AA estimates they cost its customers around £160m in total last year. The AA believes the total figure for across the entire country could be as high as £500m as it only represents around a third of Britain's drivers.
Potholes don't just affect drivers of motor vehicles, but also other road users, with cyclists being particularly vulnerable to accidents.
Scientists across the UK are researching ways to deal with the scourge for good.
At the University of Cambridge, engineering specialists are looking at projects including a digital map of where the cracks and holes are, to self-healing roads and resilient materials.
One team is working on gathering data gleaned from the sensors of modern cars to digitally map out the holes in the country's roads.
The scientists walk through a virtual reality simulation of what sensors are capable of picking up, which even includes the size and position of a pothole.
With cars now becoming smarter, the team believes the data they gather can help them get a much bigger picture of the pothole problem, rather than using a few expensive vehicles with specialist scanners.
Cambridge, along with Leeds and Liverpool Universities is researching how robots could be used to make repairs. In another Cambridge lab, a team demonstrates a robotic arm.
""We're putting together a robotic van, that can fix the most common road problems like cracks and potholes and others, and then repaint the lane markings,"" Prof Ioannis Brilakis, from Cambridge University explains.
A robot developed by Liverpool University which uses artificial intelligence (AI) to identify potential potholes is to be tested on public roads in Hertfordshire.
Other Cambridge researchers are working on materials that can withstand more extreme wear and tear and even self-heal.
One team has been working on self-healing concrete, Prof Abir Al-Tabbaa of Civil & Environmental Engineering explains in her busy laboratory. One method involves capsules within the road surface which contain a healing agent. When ruptured by a crack, the healing agent comes out and fills it.
Another researcher is investigating thermal properties of materials that could be added to our roads so that they maintain constant temperatures - cooler in the summer, warmer in the winter.
The combination of weather and wear and tear is one of the major causes of potholes. Cracks form, water seeps in, freezes and expands, pushing the road surface up. This process of freezing and thawing, as well as traffic going over the damage, weakens the road, which is further damaged in summer months when the roads dry up and potentially buckle.
More frequent extreme weather caused by climate change will speed up this cycle.
Certain reusable plastics are being trialled on highways to solve this double whammy of potholes and climate.
At the University of Surrey, Dr Benyi Cao is working with National Highways to keep road surfaces at controlled temperatures by trialling the use of geothermal energy in very specific areas.
His team is going to test ground source heat pumps, involving specialist buried pipework and microcapsules that capture energy in the soil.
If successful, the system would cool roads in summer and warm them in winter.
""Our infrastructure was not built to cope with the climate change we're currently experiencing. So new and innovative methods have to be developed now,"" Dr Cao explains.
""The link between climate change and the state of our roads is increasingly clear. It is imperative that we take concerted action to address this issue, through improved road maintenance practices, innovative materials and technologies, and broader climate change mitigation strategies.""

2024-03-04T10:39:06.000Z,ISS launch: New US-Russian crew heads to space station,BBC News,"A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carrying three US astronauts and one Russian cosmonaut has blasted off from Florida bound for the International Space Station (ISS).
The Crew-8 mission will be in space for six months. Space is one of the few areas where the US and Russia continue to co-operate closely despite the war in Ukraine.
The three men and one woman are in a capsule used in space four times before by Elon Musk's SpaceX firm.
They plan to do various experiments.
One will involve growing artificial replicas of human organs in the low-gravity environment - which is not possible on Earth.
It will be one of more than 200 science experiments that are to be conducted during the mission, scheduled to finish in mid-August, according to Nasa's ISS programme manager Joel Montalbano.
The crew of four blasted off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida at 22:53 local time (03:53 GMT Monday).
The first launch attempt on Saturday was called off due to strong winds.
A live webcast broadcast by Nasa on Sunday showed the 70m (229 ft)-tall rocket launching into the night sky, with clouds of vapour surrounding it as it rose off the ground.
The Falcon propelled the spacecraft it was carrying - named Endeavour - into orbit nine minutes after lift off.
Footage from the cabin showed the four crew members strapped into the spacecraft in their black and white flight suits.
""What an incredible ride to orbit,"" flight commander, Matthew Dominick, is quoted by Reuters news agency as saying as he radioed to ground control.
Mr Dominick and Russian Alexander Grebenkin were making their first flight into space. The other crew members on board were astronaut Jeanette Epps and physician Michael Barratt- the Crew-8 pilot - who's on his third visit to the ISS.
The four crew members are scheduled to reach the ISS on Tuesday, docking with the orbital laboratory some 250 miles (420km) above the Earth.
They will join a seven-person crew currently at the space station, Nasa said.
The International Space Station - about the length of a football field and the largest human-made object in space, according to Reuters news agency - is a rare area of international co-operation between various global governments. It has been continuously maintained by a US-Russian consortium including Canada, Japan, and 11 European countries.
Alexander Grebenkin is the latest cosmonaut to fly aboard a US spacecraft under a deal signed in 2022 by Nasa and the Russian space agency, Roscosmos,

2024-01-26T01:51:59.000Z,RSPB Garden Birdwatch 2024: Fewer wild birds visiting UK gardens,BBC News,"Fewer wild birds are visiting UK gardens, with greenfinches, starlings and sparrows seeing the greatest decline, according to the RSPB.
It comes as the conservation charity launches its annual Big Garden Birdwatch, the world's biggest wildlife citizen science project.
The once plentiful species are being spotted much less frequently than when the survey was launched 45 years ago.
But there are winners too. Goldfinches, woodpigeons and parakeets are thriving.
New analysis of data from the surveys shows that a well established fall in wild bird sightings is continuing. People who spent an hour watching in their gardens for the survey spotted four fewer during that time on average than two decades ago.
Back then they spotted an average of 28 birds, while now they see just 24 on average.
Beccy Speight, chief executive of the RSPB told the BBC: ""Sadly this snapshot is a reminder of how many of our most loved birds are at the forefront of the nature and climate emergency.""
Climate change is affecting bird populations because it is disrupting the pattern of the seasons. When spring comes early, for example, birds breed sooner than usual and that means baby birds can sometimes face sudden changes in temperature or a shortage of food.
The charity's Big Garden Birdwatch (BGBW) survey, has been taking place over the last weekend in January every year since 1979.
Up to half a million people take part each year, spending an hour watching birds in their gardens, from their balcony or in a local park.
The RSPB is urging as many people as possible to get involved with the latest survey, which is happening this weekend. You can find out how here.
The survey is a snapshot over a weekend and favours birds that live and feed near human populations, but the broad trends it shows are mirrored by other more systematic surveys.
A survey published by the British Trust for Ornithology last year found that almost half of all bird species are in decline, for example.
The BTO found the number of wild birds in Britain has fallen by 72 million since 1970.
The most dramatic declines have been in what were once the UK's most familiar species, including sparrows, starlings and greenfinches.
Most of that decline happened before 2000, and BGBW results since then suggest there has been a small but welcome uptick in numbers of sparrows and greenfinches after that.
But the starling has not been so fortunate. It is still a regular visitor to UK gardens, ranked as number three in the BGBW survey, but the numbers recorded have fallen by over 80% over the last four and half decades.
Their decline is thought to be due to the loss of permanent pasture, increased use of farm chemicals and a shortage of food and nesting sites in many areas.
Greenfinches have been hit hard too, with counts down by over 60% over the same period.
The species has been severely impacted by a disease called trichomonosis, carried by a parasite that can live on dirty birdfeeders - that's why they must be cleaned regularly.
Some other species have been thriving, however.
Goldfinches did not even make the top 15 in the BGBW rankings in 1979. Now they are up in seventh place. They have benefitted from the increase in birdfeeders in the UK.
Woodpigeons are also doing very well, up from thirteenth place in the survey to fourth position with sightings up tenfold. The RSPB says the UK now has ""internationally significant"" numbers of woodpigeons.
Another winner is the long-tailed tit. It did not feature in the top 15 species when the BGBW began but now regularly appears in the top 10. Climate change has made conditions in the UK more favourable for the bird, according to the RSPB.
Anne Brenchley of Mold in North Wales has been a keen birdwatcher for the last 60 years. Like most British birdwatchers she's noticed a big reduction in the range of birds in her garden.
""We still get lots and lots of common birds"", says Anne, ""but the numbers of some of the more unusual birds have gone down"".
She says she now never sees less common species like treecreepers, nuthatches and green woodpeckers in her garden.

2024-02-22T12:34:37.000Z,UK quits treaty that lets oil firms sue government,BBC News,"The UK has withdrawn from an international treaty that lets fossil-fuel companies sue governments pursuing climate policies for billions in compensation for lost profits.
The Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) is meant to make it easier and cheaper to trade energy between countries.
But signatories have struggled to reform it - and late on Wednesday, the UK quit the treaty calling it ""outdated"".
Green campaigners welcomed the news.
Energy Security and Net Zero Minister Graham Stuart said: ""Remaining a member would not support our transition to cleaner, cheaper energy and could even penalise us for our world-leading efforts to deliver net zero.""
Since 2001, nearly 160 legal actions based on the ECT have been brought by investors claiming their investments had been damaged by green policies such as renewable-energy subsidies, and seeking compensation from governments.
Leo Mercer, policy analyst at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change, told the BBC: ""[The treaty] was designed to protect energy companies from sudden policy decisions that undermine their investments.
""However, it has been abused by the oil and gas industry over the past few years... to the detriment of British consumers.""
In recent years, countries implementing climate-change strategies have tried to exclude fossil-fuel companies from being able to take legal action.
But after more than 15 rounds of negotiations, signatories were unable to agree when this should happen.
And the UK's withdrawal follows that of France, Spain and Germany, who worried the ECT would see them facing legal action from all sides - companies claiming they had breached the treaty and green organisations claiming they were not fulfilling their climate commitments.
In 2009, Germany faced a $1.9bn (£1.5bn) claim by Swedish energy company Vattendal, after delays for permits to operate a coal-fired power station.
Kierra Box, of Friends of the Earth, said: ""Leaving this incredibly flawed treaty is a brilliant win for our environment and the climate.
""Future UK governments will now have more freedom to take ambitious action to protect our planet, without the threat of being sued for millions of pounds by companies based overseas.""
Chris Skidmore, the Conservative MP who led the government's review into its net-zero policies, said he was ""pleased"" with the withdrawal, having called for it for over a year.
The government said the withdrawal would take affect in one year - but what will happen to cases already in progress remains unclear.

2024-03-09T01:57:10.000Z,Sycamore Gap: New life springs from rescued tree,BBC News,"New life has sprung from the rescued seeds and twigs of the Sycamore Gap tree mysteriously cut down last year, giving hope that the iconic tree has a future.
BBC News saw the new shoots on a rare visit to the secret National Trust centre protecting the seedlings.
Millions once visited the sycamore tree nestled in a gap in Hadrian's Wall.
A national outpouring of shock and dismay followed its felling in September.
Police are still investigating what happened in what they call a ""deliberate act of vandalism"". Two men remain on bail.
Just a stump is now left - if it is healthy, a new tree could eventually grow there.
Young twigs and seeds thrown to the ground when the tree toppled were salvaged by the National Trust, which cares for the site with the Northumberland National Park Authority.
When we inquired about what happened to those specimens, they invited us to see for ourselves.
We can't disclose the exact location of the high security greenhouse, except that it is somewhere in Devon.
It guards genetic copies of some of the UK's most valuable plants and trees.
Its hall of fame includes copies of the apple tree that Sir Isaac Newton said inspired his theories on gravity, and a 2,500-year-old yew that witnessed King Henry VIII's relationship with Anne Boleyn in the 1530s.
These are back-up plants - insuring the nation's heritage in case of an outbreak of disease, a devastating storm, or an attack on the trees.
No-one expected the sudden loss of the Sycamore Gap tree, once one of the most photographed spots in Britain.
Now the green shoots poking through large pots of soil give promise it will live on.
The National Trust is still deciding what to do with them once they are strong enough - schools and communities could be given saplings to grow their own Sycamore Gap tree, explains Andy Jasper, director of gardens and parklands. If the stump does not regrow, one might replace it.
But for now, the priority is nurturing the tiny shoots.
Before entering the greenhouses, we must walk through disinfectant to stop diseases contaminating the site. The blue plastic covers put on our shoes will be incinerated when we leave.
In September it was a race against time to get the seeds and living twigs to this special centre.
""As soon as you cut something down it's dying,"" explains Chris Trimmer who runs the nursery.
When the tree came down, local horticulturist Rachel Ryver sprang into action - climbing over the damaged tree and wall to collect what is called scion - young twigs with buds. This was vital raw material for grafting genetic copies of the tree.
""It was drying out fast - we had to save whatever we could. Hours later I was standing at Hexham post office thinking ""nobody knows I'm carrying what's left of the Sycamore Gap tree"","" Rachel says.
The five bags of twigs, seeds and a few leaves arrived in Devon at 09:30 the next day.
Chris Trimmer was waiting. He has worked with plants since he was 12 - decades later, he is one of the UK's leading horticulturists.
For him, like many across the country, the story is personal. The first film he went to see with his now-wife was Robin Hood Prince of Thieves - its scene of Kevin Costner and Morgan Freeman at Hadrian's Wall catapulted the tree to global fame.
Chris is softly-spoken, talking scientifically about the process. ""It's our job to graft this stuff,"" he says.
He unpacked the bags, ran tests to check the material was free of disease, then bleached it for five minutes.
It was quite a moment. ""If one had shown disease, it all would have been destroyed,"" he says.
By 15.30 Chris was done - 20 pieces grafted. But he was lucky. Autumn is a bad time to do this work - it should be done in January when the trees are dormant. He just about got away with it.
Grafting is an old technique, used by ancient Egyptians and Romans. ""It's a bit Frankenstein-esque - adding body parts onto something else, making a hybrid. But it's worked for hundreds of years,"" explains Andy Jasper.
Using a lime tree as an example, Juliet Stubbington, a propagator who works alongside Chris, demonstrates how it was done. ""You have to be confident with a knife,"" she says.
Grafting binds fresh roots with living twigs that have buds of the same species. The hope is that the two knit together to make one larger living young tree. This was the only way to preserve the beloved Sycamore Gap tree. ""It is the same tree,"" Juliet explains.
Her work is not just technical to her. ""It's lovely to help them grow back. Each one of these trees is a story,"" she says.
The horticulturalists also successfully planted seeds from the Sycamore Gap tree, now its descendants.
Five months on, they are looking after nine surviving grafted plants and 40-50 seedlings.
""This is literally the first one that came up,"" Andy Jaspar says, carrying a small pot with a 10cm green shoot. People have cried when holding it, he says. It's next to a type of rhododendron seedling that is the only known one in the world.
Juliet says the success rate should be high. Sycamores are famously hardy.
But the sense of responsibility is huge and she has to stop herself fussing over them. ""The best way to kill something is to over-care for it,"" she says.
Nothing can bring back the tree exactly as it was. It was planted in the natural dip of Hadrian's wall in the late 1800s - time and the weather moulded it into its famous silhouette.
That shape is gone but what is born from its ruins will have its own story. It will be three years before horticulturists know if the stump is healthy enough to produce the next tree.
Until then, these seedlings hundreds of miles away are primed - each one waiting to see if it could be the next Sycamore Gap tree.

2024-02-06T01:46:45.000Z,Pterosaur: Unique flying reptile soared above Isle of Skye,BBC News,"A unique species of flying reptile, or pterosaur, that lived 168-166 million years ago has been discovered on the Isle of Skye.
Its wings, shoulders, legs and backbone were found in a rock on a beach, but the fossil's skull was missing.
Scientists were surprised to find a pterosaur from this period - they were thought to mostly live in China.
The creature - called Ceoptera - is the second pterosaur found on Skye.
Its name comes from the Scottish Gaelic word ceò, meaning mist, and is a reference to the Gaelic name of Isle of Skye - known as the Isle of Mist.
Fossils from this era, called the Middle Jurassic, are extremely rare, says Dr Liz Martin-Silverstone at the University of Bristol who used a CT scanner to make a 3D digital model of the fossil.
""Finding anything from that time period that's more than just a single bone is really exciting,"" she says.
The creature probably had a wing-span of around 1m to 1.5m.
Prof Steve Brusatte, who was not involved in the research, says it was unique to Scotland. The research proves that a type of pterosaur between the primitive and advanced stages of evolution existed, he adds.
""This is the time before birds, so pterosaurs ruled the sky. This research shows that pterosaurs were common animals in Scotland, soaring over the heads of dinosaurs,"" he said.
Prof Brusatte led a project that found another type of pterosaur, called Dearc, in 2022.
In the Middle Jurassic period, Scotland was part of an island in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean with a sub-tropical climate with beaches and lagoons where the pterosaurs probably liked to live, he explains.
Scientists with the Natural History Museum first found the fossil buried in rock on a dig in 2006.
""We were looking at very dark black bone on a very dark grey rock. We were on hands and knees crawling, looking for small smears of bone on the surface,"" says Dr Paul Barrett who was on the expedition.
The team carried the fragile fossil in backpacks on the journey back to London to protect it from damage, he adds.
It took thousands of hours to remove enough of the hard limestone rock around the fossil so it could be studied.
After using acid to dissolve rock and then scanning the specimen, scientists have now published their classification of the fossil.
""This group of more advanced flying reptiles had an earlier flourishing than we originally thought,"" says Dr Barrett.
The creature is from the Darwinoptera branch of pterosaurs. The research shows that the group lived for more than 25 million years, from the late Early Jurassic to the latest Jurassic, explains Dr Martin-Silverstone.
The findings are published in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology.

2024-01-09T12:00:24.000Z,2023 confirmed as world's hottest year on record,BBC News,"The year 2023 has been confirmed as the warmest on record, driven by human-caused climate change and boosted by the natural El Niño weather event.
Last year was about 1.48C warmer than the long-term average before humans started burning large amounts of fossil fuels, the EU's climate service says.
Almost every day since July has seen a new global air temperature high for the time of year, BBC analysis shows.
Sea surface temperatures have also smashed previous highs.
The Met Office reported last week that the UK experienced its second warmest year on record in 2023.
These global records are bringing the world closer to breaching key international climate targets.
""What struck me was not just that [2023] was record-breaking, but the amount by which it broke previous records,"" notes Andrew Dessler, a professor of atmospheric science at Texas A&M University.
The margin of some of these records - which you can see on the chart below - is ""really astonishing"", Prof Dessler says, considering they are averages across the whole world.
It's well-known that the world is much warmer now than 100 years ago, as humans keep releasing record amounts of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
But 12 months ago, no major science body actually predicted 2023 being the hottest year on record, because of the complicated way in which the Earth's climate behaves.
During the first few months of the year, only a small number of days broke air temperature records.
But the world then went on a remarkable, almost unbroken streak of daily records in the second half of 2023.
Look at the calendar chart below, where each block represents a day in 2023. Records were broken on the days coloured in the darkest shade of red. From June, we're looking at a new record most days.
More than 200 days saw a new daily global temperature record for the time of year, according to BBC analysis of Copernicus Climate Change Service data.
This recent temperature boost is mainly linked to the rapid switch to El Niño conditions, which has occurred on top of long-term human-caused warming.
El Niño is a natural event where warmer surface waters in the East Pacific Ocean release additional heat into the atmosphere.
But air temperatures have been boosted unusually early on in this El Niño phase - the full effects had not been expected until early 2024, after El Niño had reached maximum strength.
This has left many scientists unsure about exactly what is going on with the climate.
""That raises a bunch of really interesting questions of why [2023 was] so warm,"" notes Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist at Berkeley Earth, a science organisation in the US.
Another notable feature of the 2023 warmth is that it has been felt pretty much worldwide.
As the map below shows, almost all of the globe was warmer than recent 1991-2020 levels - a period that was itself nearly 0.9C warmer than before humans started burning large amounts of fossil fuels in the late 1800s.
This record global warmth has helped to worsen many extreme weather events across large parts of the world in 2023 - from intense heatwaves and wildfires across Canada and the US, to prolonged drought and then flooding in parts of east Africa.
Many occurred on scales far beyond those seen in recent times, or at unusual points of the year.
""These are more than just statistics,"" says Prof Petteri Taalas, the Secretary General of the World Meteorological Organization between 2016 and 2023.
""Extreme weather is destroying lives and livelihoods on a daily basis.""
The temperature of the air is only one measure of the Earth's rapidly changing climate. Also in 2023:
In fact, the world's ocean surface has been on an unbroken streak of record-breaking days since 4 May, BBC analysis of Copernicus data shows. As the chart below illustrates, many days have seen records broken by a huge margin.
The year 2024 could be warmer than 2023 - as some of the record ocean surface heat escapes into the atmosphere - although the ""weird"" behaviour of the current El Niño means it's hard to be sure, Dr Hausfather says.
It raises the possibility that 2024 may even surpass the key 1.5C warming threshold across the entire calendar year for the first time, according to the UK Met Office.
Nearly 200 countries agreed in Paris in 2015 to try to limit warming to this level, to avoid the worst effects of global warming.
It refers to long-term averages over 20 or 30 years, so a year-long breach in 2024 wouldn't mean the Paris agreement had been broken.
But it highlights the concerning direction of travel, with each hot year bringing the world closer to passing 1.5C over the longer term.
Human activities are behind this long-term global warming trend, even though natural factors like El Niño can raise or reduce temperatures for individual years, and the temperatures experienced in 2023 go far beyond simply natural causes.
Look at the chart below. At the time, 1998 and 2016 were record-breaking years, boosted by strong El Niño warming. But these don't come close to the new 2023 records, marked in the darkest reds.
""2023 was an exceptional year, with climate records tumbling like dominoes,"" concludes Dr Samantha Burgess, Deputy Director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service.
This latest warning comes shortly after the COP28 climate summit, where countries agreed for the first time on the need to tackle the main cause of rising temperatures - fossil fuels.
While the language of the deal was weaker than many wanted - with no obligation for countries to act - it's hoped that it will help to build on some recent encouraging progress in areas like renewable power and electric vehicles.
This can still make a crucial difference to limit the consequences of climate change, researchers say, even though the 1.5C target looks likely to be missed.
""Even if we end up at 1.6C instead, it will be so much better than giving up and ending up close to 3C, which is where current policies would bring us,"" says Dr Friederike Otto, a senior lecturer in climate science at Imperial College London.
""Every tenth of a degree matters.""

2024-03-12T08:13:18.000Z,"New gas power plants needed to bolster energy supply, PM says",BBC News,"The UK needs to build new, gas-fired power stations to ensure the country's energy security, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said on Tuesday.
The new stations would replace existing plants, many of which are aging and will soon be retired.
But the government says the plans do not include measures for climate change-limiting carbon capture.
That could threaten a legally binding commitment to cut carbon emissions to net zero by 2050, critics say.
Mr Sunak, writing in the Daily Telegraph, said new gas power stations were needed to have a reliable and affordable back-up for days when renewables like wind and solar did not deliver.
""It is the insurance policy Britain needs to protect our energy security, while we deliver our net zero transition,"" the prime minister wrote.
The government did not give any details about when or where the new power stations would be built.
The decision, which Energy Security Secretary Claire Coutinho outlined in a speech at Chatham House in London, is part of a wide-reaching review of how the UK's energy market works.
But the Green Alliance think tank said it ""flies in the face"" of the government's promise to reach zero-carbon electricity by 2035.
The Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit said falling North Sea output would leave the UK ever more dependent on foreign gas.
Labour accused the Tories of leaving the UK facing another 10 years of high energy bills, but acknowledged retiring gas-fired stations needed to be replaced.
Shadow energy secretary Ed Miliband said: ""The reason the Tories cannot deliver the lower bills and energy security we need is that they are specialists in failure when it comes to our clean energy future.""
He accused the Conservatives of ""persisting with the ludicrous ban on onshore wind, bungling the offshore wind auctions, and failing on energy efficiency"".
Liberal Democrat energy and climate change spokesperson Wera Hobhouse said that announcement was ""another step backwards on the critical road to net zero"".
""We need to wean ourselves off this reliance on expensive fossil fuels by investing in cheap, clean renewable power and insulating every home,"" she said.
The government says the new plants will guarantee energy security, ensure low electricity prices in the future and rid Britain of  the need to rely on foreign dictators like Russian President Vladimir Putin.
""A nation that is dependent on the whims of dictators for its energy supply can never be truly safe,"" Mr Sunak wrote in the Daily Telegraph.
The government says it expects more and more of the UK's electricity to come from renewable power in the future but says it cannot be relied on completely.
So, as existing gas power stations are retired, they will need to be replaced with new ones, better suited to the requirements of an increasingly decarbonised energy system.
The new plants will be capable of operating efficiently for just an hour or two at a time to fill in the gaps from other power sources, the government said.
The plan is they will be built by private investors.
The government said it will change the law to ensure the new plants would be capable of being retrofitted to burn hydrogen or to be fitted with carbon capture and storage technologies in the future.
The government says its plans are in line with the recommendations of the Climate Change Committee (CCC), its independent watchdog on climate.
The CCC has said a ""small amount"" of gas generation without carbon capture is compatible with a decarbonised power system.
It has estimated that might amount to 2% of annual electricity production.
But Liam Hardy, a senior policy advisor at the Green Alliance think tank, said the decision to build new gas plants without carbon capture ""flies in the face"" of the government's promise to reach zero-carbon electricity by 2035"".
""Every new gas power plant built in the UK will make bills higher for consumers in the long run while increasing the risks of runaway climate change,"" he said.
Greenpeace said the government's plans would ""make Britain more dependent on the very fossil fuel that sent our bills rocketing and our planet's temperature soaring"".
""The only route to a low-cost, secure and clean energy system is through attracting massive private investment to develop renewables and upgrade our aging grid,"" said Doug Parr, policy director at the campaign group.
Meanwhile, Jess Ralston of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit warned that the new power plants would not reduce the UK's dependence on foreign gas.
""The North Sea will continue its inevitable decline with or without new licenses leaving us ever more dependent on foreign gas unless we lower demand,"" she said.

2024-01-25T08:35:26.000Z,Stricken Japanese Moon mission landed on its nose,BBC News,"Japan's Moon lander ended up on its nose when it made its historic touchdown on the lunar surface.
The first picture of the stricken Slim spacecraft shows it rotated 90 degrees from how it should have come to rest.
This will go some way to explaining the difficulties it has had in generating the electricity needed to operate.
The image was captured by the small baseball-sized robot called Sora-Q that was ejected from Slim moments before touchdown last Saturday.
""An abnormality in the main engine affected the landing attitude of the spacecraft,"" the Japanese space agency Jaxa said in a statement.
It seems one of the two big thrusters on Slim (Smart Lander for Investigating Moon) stopped working during the descent.
To get the picture to Earth, Sora-Q first had to transmit it to a second ejected roving robot, Lunar Excursion Vehicle 1, or Lev-1. This hopping robot has radio equipment that can contact mission control independently of Slim.
The lander itself was shut down three hours after arrival because it could not get its solar cells to work. With the battery rapidly draining, Jaxa officials took the decision to hibernate Slim.
Their assumption - which seems to be borne out by the Sora-Q image - is that the main spacecraft is orientated in a way that prevents the solar cells from seeing the Sun.
The hope is to wake Slim when lighting angles change at its landing location.
Before hibernation, controllers were able to pull down a series of pictures of the surface taken by its on-board infrared camera.
These show the spacecraft to be on a slope, surrounded by small rocks.
Slim's landing location is at the edge of an equatorial crater known as Shioli.
The landing on Saturday at 00:20, Japan standard time (15:20 GMT, Friday), made Jaxa only the fifth national space agency to achieve a soft touchdown on the Moon - after the US, the former Soviet Union, China and India.
Statistically, it's proved very hard to put down softly on the lunar surface. Only about a half of all attempts have succeeded.
Jaxa put its faith in new precision-navigation technologies.
The lander's onboard computer used rapid image processing and crater mapping to avoid hazards to reach its touchdown point.
Engineers had wanted to get within 100m (330ft) of their targeted location. This was achieved.
""Analysis of the data acquired before shutting down the power confirmed that Slim had reached the Moon's surface approximately 55m east of the original target landing site,"" said Jaxa, adding that the onboard computer had also taken a decision in the final moments of descent to move the craft to one side to avoid obstacles.
This will delight officials, as will the success of the two rovers. Not only did Sora-Q move on the lunar surface and take its picture, but Lev-1 also managed to hop. Like Slim, Lev-1 has also powered down.
""The accomplishment of Lev-1's leaping movements on the lunar surface, inter-robot communication between Lev-1 and Sora-Q, and fully autonomous operations represent ground-breaking achievement. It would be regarded as a valuable technology demonstration for future lunar explorations, and the acquired knowledge and experience will be applied in upcoming missions,"" the agency said.

2024-01-24T01:50:04.000Z,Climate change: Four new emperor penguin groups found by satellite,BBC News,"Four new emperor penguin colonies have been identified in Antarctica from satellite imagery.
It brings the number of known nesting sites around the White Continent to 66.
With the discoveries, scientists believe they now know the whereabouts of all the world's remaining breeding pairs.
It's vital information for conservationists monitoring a species that's under increasing pressure as a result of climate change.
Emperors court, mate, lay and hatch eggs, and then bring up their young on the sea-ice connected to the coast - so-called fast ice.
But this type of ice has diminished in parts of Antarctica and become more variable, certainly in recent years, putting a big question mark against the long-term viability of the species in an ever-warming world.
Emperors are the largest species of penguin, standing at over 1m tall.
They live in extreme conditions, collecting together during the height of the Antarctic winter to breed in distinct groupings.
These colonies tend to be separated from each other by an average of about 250km (150 miles). Scientists have been using satellites to search the gaps in this spacing for birds they didn't know about - and think all significant colonies have now been identified.
The four new sites are welcome news, even though they add just a few thousand extra individuals to what's estimated to be an overall population of about 550,000.
""It's good that even as emperors are being affected by changing ice conditions, we're still finding colonies,"" said Dr Peter Fretwell from the British Antarctic Survey (BAS).
""But it's also clear these birds are going to have to be adaptable, to move around to new sites as those ice conditions continue to change, and we're seeing evidence of this,"" he told BBC News.
At least one of the newly identified colonies - named Lazarev North - is likely a grouping of birds that had to abandon a nearby site to take up a more favourable home.
The new Gipps colony, too, shows evidence in the satellite record of having shifted its position over time.
The two other locations, at Verleger Point and Vanhoeffen, appear to have had a more permanent history.
Vanhoeffen was probably missed in previous searches because it is 30km offshore, on fast ice that has developed around old icebergs which became stuck in shallow water.
Satellites have been the technique of choice for finding emperors. Antarctica's size and remoteness make observation from space the only practical approach.
The colonies are traced by the staining their guano (""poo"") leaves on the white ice.
If the birds are gathered in large enough numbers, this staining will be visible even from space.
Dr Fretwell has identified about half the colonies we now know about.
He uses the EU's twin Sentinel-2 spacecraft. Their repeat imagery has, for example, allowed the BAS scientist to monitor the repeated attempts by emperors to re-establish a colony near Britain's Halley research station.
The colony, known as Halley Bay, was once the second largest in all Antarctica, but was wiped out in 2016 when sea-ice conditions suddenly changed.
Thousands of young emperors drowned or froze to death when the fast ice on which they were standing broke apart.
A pioneer group of birds has now set up a nesting site around a point that recently witnessed the calving of two monster icebergs.
""It just shows this is a species that has to be dynamic,"" said Dr Fretwell.
""When we do get future ice losses, emperors can and will move. It's in their nature.""
The BAS scientist has not long returned from Antarctica where he's been tracking emperors with satellite tags.
This is providing new insights on the distances the birds will travel to forage for the food they need to bring back for their young at nesting sites.
The data shows the adults can travel over 100km (62 miles) a day.
The new penguin colonies are reported in the journal Antarctic Science.

2024-01-19T04:19:24.000Z,Peregrine lander: American Moon mission destroyed over Pacific Ocean,BBC News,"A US spacecraft launched last week to try to land on the Moon has ended its mission in flames over the Pacific.
Peregrine One suffered a propulsion fault that scuppered any prospect of a lunar touch-down and it was commanded to destroy itself instead.
The private operator, Pittsburgh-based Astrobotic, directed the craft into Earth's atmosphere to burn up.
A tracking station in Canberra, Australia, confirmed loss of signal with Peregrine at 20:59 GMT.
Little or no remains of Peregrine were expected to survive intact to the ocean surface. And even if they did, they should have impacted far away from any population.
Astrobotic's goal had been to deliver five Nasa instruments to the Moon's surface, to study the local environment ahead of the return of astronauts later this decade.
Had the Peregrine craft been able to land successfully, it would have become the first American mission in half a century to do so, and the first ever private venture to achieve the feat.
Only government agencies from the US, the Soviet Union, China and India have managed controlled lunar landings to date.
But Astrobotic's mission was in trouble almost as soon as it came off the top of its launch rocket on Monday 8 January. It can, though, console itself with what it did manage to accomplish in difficult circumstances by continuing to operate Peregrine in space for more than 10 days.
Engineers were able to diagnose what went wrong with Peregrine and then eke out life in the lander far beyond what seemed possible at the start.
""Space exploration is a learning game, especially at this stage and we shouldn't look at this as a failure; we should look at this as an incredible engineering success,"" Sian Cleaver, Airbus' Orion European Service Module industrial manager, told the BBC's Today Programme.
""At one point it was looking like this mission was doomed, but a team of engineers and scientists managed to work together and to problem solve and to restore some capabilities of the spacecraft and ultimately direct it back to Earth,"" she said. ""I think that's actually pretty impressive.""
""There's a lot that we can take away from this, but ultimately space travel is difficult and we're seeing that here.""
The fault was traced to leaking propellant from a ruptured oxidiser tank. This was generating a thrust, turning the craft and preventing it from keeping its solar panels constantly pointed at the Sun - vital to maintain a power supply.
Astrobotic posted a video on social media showing the spacecraft's view of Earth before it burned up.
The Astrobotic team worked the thrusters on Peregrine to restore stable pointing, but this of course used up even more of the rapidly depleting oxidiser.
Nonetheless, payloads onboard were activated, proving their space-worthiness, and some were even able to gather data, such as on the nature of the radiation environment between Earth and the Moon.
One of the Nasa instruments to be started up - the Peregrine Ion Trap Mass Spectrometer (PITMS) - had its sensor and electronics developed in the UK by the Open University and RAL Space.
The instrument was reported to be performing well in the check-out tests. The technology should have the opportunity to fly again on later lunar missions.
Astrobotic is the first of three US companies to send a lander to the Moon this year under a new private-public partnership with Nasa.
The agency is buying transport services from the Pittsburgh firm and two other commercial ventures - Intuitive Machines and Firefly. Together, the trio had planned six missions to the lunar surface in 2024.
Astrobotic should get a second go in the back half of the year when it tries to land a Nasa rover called Viper. Houston-based Intuitive Machines' first attempt is likely to launch next month. Its Nova-C craft will be aimed at the lunar south pole.
Before then, the Japanese space agency will try to put down safely close to a near-equatorial impact crater called Shioli. This event is scheduled for 15:20 GMT on Friday.

2024-02-23T22:39:26.000Z,Intuitive Machines: Odysseus Moon lander 'tipped over on touchdown',BBC News,"The Odysseus Moon lander is probably lying on its side with its head resting against a rock.
The US spacecraft, which made history on Thursday by becoming the first ever privately built and operated robot to complete a soft lunar touchdown, is otherwise in good condition.
Its owner, Texan firm Intuitive Machines, says Odysseus has plenty of power and is communicating with Earth.
Controllers are trying to retrieve pictures from the robot.
Steve Altemus, the CEO and co-founder of IM, said it wasn't totally clear what had happened but the data suggested the robot caught a foot on the surface and then fell because it still had some lateral motion at the moment of landing.
Another possibility is that Odysseus broke a leg as it came down. Certainly, inertial measurement sensors indicate the body of the vehicle to be in a horizontal pose.
Whatever the reason for the unexpected landed configuration, radio antennas are still pointing at Earth and solar cells continue to collect energy to charge the battery system.
Fortuitously, all the scientific instruments that planned to take observations on the Moon are on the side of Odysseus facing up, which should allow them to do some work. The only payload on the ""wrong side"" of the lander, pointing down at the lunar surface, is a static art project.
""We're hopeful to get pictures and really do an assessment of the structure and assessment of all the external equipment,"" Mr Altemus told reporters.
""So far, we have quite a bit of operational capability even though we're tipped over. And so that's really exciting for us, and we are continuing the surface operations mission as a result of it.""
The robot had been directed to a cratered terrain near the Moon's south pole, and the IM team believes it got very close to the targeted site, perhaps within 2km or 3km.
A US space agency satellite called the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter will search for Odysseus this weekend to confirm its whereabouts.
The IM mission is part of Nasa's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) programme, in which the agency is paying various private American companies for cargo services to the Moon - in the case of Odysseus with a fee of $118M (£93m).
All the companies are responsible for the financing, build, launch and operation of their spacecraft - and for finding commercial payloads to supplement Nasa's.
Six CLPS missions were planned for this year and early 2025. The first, by Pittsburgh-based firm Astrobotic, ended in failure. Its Peregrine lander developed technical problems en route to the Moon and gave up the opportunity of a touchdown. The robot was brought back to burn up in Earth's atmosphere.
Intuitive Machines has two further missions in prospect for 2024. The next will see a robot drill into the surface. Another Texan company, Firefly Aerospace, should also shoot for the Moon at some point in the coming months.
Nasa regards the CLPS approach as a more economical way of getting its science done, while at the same time seeding what it hopes will become a thriving lunar economy.
Joel Kearns, from the agency's science mission directorate, described the Odysseus landing as a ""gigantic accomplishment"", and an affirmation of the CLPS policy.
Irrespective of its current functionality, Odysseus is unlikely to work much beyond the beginning of March when darkness will fall on the landing site.
""Once the Sun sets on 'Oddie', the batteries will attempt to keep the vehicle warm and alive but eventually it'll fall into a deep cold and then the electronics that we produce just won't survive the deep cold of lunar night. And so, best case scenario, we're looking at another nine to 10 days (of operations),"" said Tim Crain, IM's CTO and co-founder.

In a statement, Nasa said the aircraft was forced to perform an ""emergency landing"" that damaged its rotors.
The space agency's Bill Nelson said the aircraft was ""the little helicopter that could"" and had racked up far more flights than had been intended.
He said Ingenuity had ""paved the way for future flight in our Solar System"".
Ingenuity is said to remain ""upright"" but images showed that ""one or more of its rotor blades"" were damaged and it was ""no longer capable of flight"".
Nasa said the circumstances were being investigated.
""Ingenuity has paved the way for future flight in our Solar System, and it's leading the way for smarter, safer human missions to Mars and beyond,"" Mr Nelson, the Nasa administrator, said in a video message on social media.
""That remarkable helicopter flew higher and farther than we ever imagined and helped Nasa do what we do best - make the impossible, possible.""
Ingenuity reached the Red Planet in February 2021 by riding on the belly of the Perseverance rover.
It was meant to be on a short technology demonstration to prove flight was possible in the ultra-thin Martian atmosphere.
The vehicle went on to support Perseverance in its exploration of Jezero Crater by previewing areas of Mars that might be of interest, helping the wheeled robot and its drivers on Earth pick the right path.
Before its mission came to an end on Thursday, Ingenuity performed 72 flights and flew more than 14 times farther than originally planned.
Many will mourn the passing of the plucky chopper but its withdrawal from service has probably come at the right time, the BBC's science correspondent Jonathan Amos says.
The Perseverance rover is about to undertake some long, fast drives as it seeks to climb up on to the rim of Jezero Crater.
If still functional, Ingenuity would, in all likelihood, have struggled to keep up with Perseverance, or at the very least held up the rover's exploration.

2024-01-09T15:22:52.000Z,Deep-sea mining: Norway approves controversial practice,BBC News,"Norway has become the first country in the world to move forward with the controversial practice of commercial-scale deep-sea mining.
The bill, passed on Tuesday, will accelerate the hunt for precious metals which are in high demand for green technologies.
Environmental scientists have warned it could be devastating for marine life.
The plan concerns Norwegian waters, but agreement on mining in international waters could also be reached this year.
The Norwegian government said it was being cautious and would only begin issuing licences once further environmental studies were carried out.
The deep sea hosts potato-sized rocks called nodules and crusts which contain minerals such as lithium, scandium and cobalt, critical for clean technologies, including in batteries.
Norway's proposal will open up 280,000 sq km (108,000 sq miles) of its national waters for companies to apply to mine these sources - an area bigger than the size of the UK.
Although these minerals are available on land, they are concentrated in a few countries, increasing the risk to supply. For example, the Democratic Republic of Congo, which holds some of the largest reserves of cobalt, faces conflict in parts of the country.
Walter Sognnes, co-founder of Norwegian mining company Loke Minerals, which plans to apply for a licence recognised that more needs to be done to understand the deep ocean before mining begins.
He told the BBC: ""We will have a relatively long period of exploration and mapping activity to close the knowledge gap on the environmental impact.""
Martin Webeler, oceans campaigner and researcher at the Environmental Justice Foundation, said it is ""catastrophic"" for the ocean habitat.
""The Norwegian government always highlighted that they want to implement the highest environmental standards,"" he said. ""That is hypocritical whilst you are throwing away all the scientific advice.""
He said that mining companies should focus on preventing environmental damage in current operations, rather than opening up a whole new industry.
The move puts the country at odds with the EU and the UK, which have called for a temporary ban on the practice because of concerns about environmental damage.
Techniques to harvest the minerals from the sea floor could generate significant noise and light pollution, as well as damage to the habitat of organisms relying on the nodules, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).
In November, in an unusual move, 120 EU lawmakers wrote an open letter calling on the Norwegian parliament to reject the project because of ""the risk of such activity to marine biodiversity and the acceleration of climate change"". The letter also said the impact assessment conducted by Norway had too many knowledge gaps.
As well as external criticism, the Norwegian government has also faced pushback from its own experts. The Norway Institute of Marine Research (IMR) said that the government had made assumptions from a small area of research and applied it to the whole area planned for drilling. It estimates a further five to 10 years of research into impacts on species is needed.
The Norwegian government will not immediately allow companies to start drilling. They will have to submit proposals, including environmental assessments, for a licence which will then be approved on a case-by-case basis by parliament.
Marianne Sivertsen Næss, chair of The Standing Committee on Energy and the Environment, which considered the original plan, told the BBC that the Norwegian government was taking a ""precautionary approach to mineral activities"".
She said: ""We do not currently have the knowledge needed to extract minerals from the seabed in the manner required. The government's proposal to open an area for activity enables private players to explore and acquire knowledge and data from the areas in question. Opening up areas is not the same as approving extraction of seabed minerals.""
Mr Sognnes, of Loke Minerals, added that the government's plan would bring in much-needed investment from the private sector for research of deep marine environments.
""Develop[ing] knowledge on the deep ocean is very costly, you need to operate robots and these are very expensive and unfortunately the universities have limited access to these kind of tools,"" he said. He estimated that any actual extraction would not begin until the early 2030s.
Campaigners argue that more investment should go into recycling and reusing the existing minerals we have mined on land. The Environmental Justice Foundation estimates in a report that 16,000 tonnes of cobalt per year, about 10% of annual production, could be recovered through improved collection and recycling of mobile phones.
While Norway's proposal concerns its national waters, negotiations continue on whether licences could be issued for international seas.
The International Seabed Authority (ISA) - a UN-affiliated body - will meet this year to try to finalise rules, with a final vote expected in 2025. More than 30 countries are in favour of a temporary ban, but countries such as China are keen to see the ISA press on.

2024-02-06T02:14:56.000Z,Electric cars: Lords urge action on 'misinformation' in press,BBC News,"The government must do more to counter ""misinformation"" on electric vehicles published in parts of the UK press, a Lords enquiry has said.
Despite the UK passing the milestone on Monday of 1m electric cars registered, growth of the sector has flatlined.
The Lords Climate Change Committee urged the government to build consumer confidence and push back against what it called mistruths on range and cost.
The government did not comment on this but said £2bn was committed to EVs.
Nearly a quarter of the UK's carbon emissions - responsible for climate change - are produced by road transport, according to the latest figures. Switching to electric vehicles could help to significantly reduce these emissions, but despite government and industry efforts only about 3% of cars are powered by electricity.
Baroness Parminter, chair of the committee, told the BBC that both government officials and other witnesses to the enquiry had reported reading disinformation on the subject in national newspapers.
""We have seen a concerted effort to scare people... we have seen articles saying that cars are catching fire - but had evidence that the fire risk is absolutely the same as [petrol and diesel] cars,"" she said.
The Lords committee did not single out any newspaper in particular.
Testifying before the committee, Richard Bruce, Director of Transport Decarbonisation at the Department for Transport, conceded there was a problem.
He said: ""I do think there has been an impact from a concerted campaign of misinformation over the last 14 months or so that has been pushing consistent myths about EVs that people absorb and which is reflected in their appetite [for purchasing EVs].
""There is an anti-EV story in the papers almost every day. Sometimes there are many stories, almost all of which are based on misconceptions and mistruths, unfortunately.""
Baroness Parminter said the government needed to step in and provide reliable information to consumers.
""In the speech by the PM last year where he said getting to net zero was going to be hard… the message that the public got is that this was less of a priority, I don't need to worry about this now. But net zero is fast approaching and the sooner we do it the cheaper it will be,"" she added.
The government has made available a list of common questions and answers on the transition to EVs, including battery range and chargepoint availability across the country.
As well as tackling misinformation the committee also called on the government to unlock funding more quickly for local authorities to install charging infrastructure.  The Lords heard how local authorities had to wait eight months to have their applications processed for the On-street Residential Chargepoint Scheme (ORCS).
The number of public chargers also varies significantly across the country. In the North West there are just 31 public chargers per 100,000 population compared with 131 in London.
Cllr Darren Rodwell, transport spokesperson for the Local Government Association, said: ""Councils will do what they can in partnership with the private sector to respond to growing demand and local priorities.""
But he added: ""The best way of supporting the transition to net-zero emissions from local transport is for councils to be given long-term funding certainty.""
A Department for Transport spokesperson told the BBC that this week: ""The first councils are starting to receive part of the £381m local electric vehicle infrastructure fund alongside new grants to install charge points in state schools and nurseries.""
The Lords did recognise the challenges that the government faced with falling tax revenues as the number of EVs grow and said road taxation will need to be ""fundamentally redesigned"". Currently EV owners are not required to pay excise duty, congestion charge and fuel duty.
But Melanie Shufflebotham, co-founder of ZapMap, a UK EV mapping service, told the BBC that bringing in new taxes for EVs was too early as consumer confidence was still growing.
She offered an alternative solution: ""We need to up the taxes on the heavy polluting petrol and diesel cars. It is the heavy vehicles that cause the most damage.""
Paris residents just voted to introduce higher parking charges for large SUV petrol and diesel vehicles as part of efforts to recoup public costs from more polluting modes of transport.

2024-01-09T21:21:17.000Z,Artemis: Nasa delays crewed return to the Moon's surface,BBC News,"US space agency astronauts won't get to walk on the Moon again until September 2026 at the earliest.
It represents a slip of a year in the previously targeted date for the return of humans to the lunar surface that was last achieved in 1972.
Nasa says the delay to what's known as its Artemis III mission will enable further technology development.
Fundamentally, the agency still doesn't have a craft to put astronauts on the Moon or spacesuits they can wear.
Announcing the delay, agency administrator Bill Nelson said safety drove all timing considerations. ""We won't fly until we're ready,"" he told reporters.
Nasa is also pushing back to September 2025 the precursor mission known as Artemis II. This will see four astronauts fly around the Moon without actually landing. Until today, this flight was in the calendar for the end of this year.
A crew comprising Jeremy Hansen, Christina Koch, Victor Glover and Reid Wiseman are already in training.
Artemis I occurred in November 2022. This was an uncrewed demonstration of the SLS rocket and Orion capsule that Nasa will use to get astronauts to lunar orbit. But the capsule now requires the installation of a life-support system before the Artemis II quartet can climb aboard and the space agency says there are concerns about the electronics in this system that will now have to be revised.
Engineers also want more time to understand the behaviour and performance of the heatshield that protects the Orion capsule during the fiery re-entry into Earth's atmosphere at the end of a mission. This shield experienced some unexpected losses of material during the Artemis I return.
But Nasa's biggest issue going forwards is probably the landing craft for Artemis III.
This will be supplied by entrepreneur Elon Musk's SpaceX company and it will be a version of the huge new Starship vehicle currently being tested in Texas.
The idea is for astronauts to transfer to Starship in lunar orbit and then go down in it to the Moon's surface.
SpaceX needs not only to get the new vehicle working properly but also to stage an uncrewed demonstration at the Moon. And just getting Starship to the vicinity of the Moon will require the company to refuel its craft in Earth orbit first - a practice that's completely novel.
Indeed, it could take 10 launches, or more, of other Starships just to get enough fuel into one vehicle above the Earth so it can make the journey to the Moon and then perform a landing.
Nasa associate administrator Jim Free was asked if it was realistic to think all this technology could be perfected by September 2026.
""We're setting a date for [Artemis III] that we have set with our contractors, based on the technical plans that they've laid out,"" he responded. ""What I can tell you is we put margin in there to account for some of the risks that we anticipate seeing. We've tried to address the unknown unknowns and set a realistic plan in place.""
Dates not slipping currently are those for the Artemis IV and V missions, which are set to take place in 2028 and 2029 respectively.
IV will see the first astronaut flight to the new Gateway lunar space station that will be constructed this decade. V will see the introduction of a second landing system called Blue Moon. This is being developed by the space company owned by Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos.

2024-01-16T01:33:43.000Z,"A23a: Spectacular arches, caves as monster iceberg decays",BBC News,"Erosion is sculpting dramatic features in the world's biggest iceberg in what's likely to be the final months of its existence.
A ship run by the Eyos expeditions company arrived at the frozen behemoth, A23a, on Sunday to find huge caves and arches cut into its frozen walls.
The berg is being ground down by the warmer air and surface waters it's encountering as it drifts slowly away from the White Continent.
Ultimately, it will melt and disappear.
""We saw waves, a good 3m or 4m high, smashing into the berg,"" said expedition leader Ian Strachan.
""These were creating cascades of ice - a constant state of erosion,"" he told BBC News.
A23a broke away from the Antarctic coastline way back in 1986, but it's only recently begun a big migration.
For more than 30 years, it was stuck rigidly in the bottom-muds of the Weddell Sea like a static ""ice island"", measuring some 4,000 sq km (1,500 sq miles) in area. That's more than twice the size of Greater London.
The colossus is presently drifting in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, the great sweep of water that circles the continent in a clockwise direction.
This current, together with the prevailing westerlies, is pushing A23a in the general direction of the South Orkney Islands, which are about 600km (370 miles) northeast of the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.
It is firmly in the track of what scientists refer to as ""iceberg alley"" - the major route for the export of ice from the continent.
The interplay of winds, ocean fronts and eddies will determine its precise course over the coming weeks, but many of these giant flat-topped, or tabular, bergs end up passing by the British Overseas Territory of South Georgia.
Their destiny is to fragment and wither to nothing. Their legacy is the ocean life they seed by dropping entrained mineral nutrients. From plankton up to great whales - all benefit from the melting bergs' fertilisation effect.
On Sunday, the Eyos team got close enough to A23a to put up a drone. The berg's 30m-high cliffs were topped by a dense mist. Icebergs on this scale create their own weather.
""It was dramatic and beautiful to photograph,"" said Eyos videographer Richard Sidey.
""It's mind-bogglingly big. I actually don't think we can fathom just how big it is; we can only know how big it is from science. It's certainly too big to photograph. It stretches as far as you can see in both directions.""
Satellite observations can monitor its area coverage and gauge its thickness, which is over 300m (980ft) in places. In terms of mass, it's not far off a trillion tonnes, although this will be decreasing day by day.
The big question is: how long can A23a survive as it moves away from the colder climes of the Antarctic?
Milder air temperatures will create surface melt ponds that drain through the berg, helping to open up fractures. And those spectacular surface catacombs and buttresses will collapse to leave extensive areas of submerged ice that will then rise up under their own buoyancy to gnaw away at the berg's edges.
But another large block of ice ahead of A23a on the highway may be instructive in understanding its potential longevity.
Iceberg D28, also known by its popular name, ""Molar Berg"", is now moving up into the South Atlantic, some 200km (125 miles) north of South Georgia. Even though it's lost about a third of its area since calving from Antarctica's Amery Ice Shelf in 2019, D28 has managed to maintain its basic, compact shape.
Could A23a, with its own square-like dimensions, be similarly long-lived?

2024-02-27T00:25:33.000Z,Climate change: 'Ice bumps' reveal history of Antarctic melting,BBC News,"Scientists say they now have a better idea of exactly where and when the margin of Antarctica started melting.
They've traced the changing shapes of bumps on the ice surface that mark locations where glaciers are anchored in place.
Half a century ago, few of these frozen moorings, or ""pinning points"", showed much change.
Since 2000, however, more than a third have reduced in size, emphasising the acceleration in melting.
The research is published in the journal Nature and underscores once again the increasing contribution that ice losses from the continent will make to future sea-level rise around the globe.
The study's focus was the ice shelves that fringe 75% per cent of Antarctica's coastline.
The shelves are the floating fronts of glaciers that have pushed out into the surrounding ocean.
Many of them - especially in the west of the continent - are being assaulted by warm water and are thinning as a consequence.
That's bad news because they are regarded as a key braking mechanism, slowing the movement of ice off the continent.
In places where the seafloor is shallow - where there's an underwater hill, for example - the shelves can get caught in place, holding back the glacier ice to their rear.
The pinning points are reasonably obvious to a passing satellite because they produce a lump at the shelf surface where the flowing ice has had to ride over them.
What the Edinburgh University team did was analyse through time how these bumps had changed shape.
The idea was to see if the bumps got smaller, which would imply the shelves were thinning - that they were melting; that their braking force was getting weaker.
Dr Bertie Miles went back through the entire image archive from the long-running American Landsat spacecraft series to assemble new, cloudless mosaics of Antarctica's coastline.
He then analysed what happened at the ice surface during three periods: from 1973 to 1989, 1990 to 2000 and from 2000 to 2022.
In the initial period, only 15% of pinning points reduced in size. This then picked up in the 1990s, when 25% experienced shrinkage. And then, in the final period, 37% of pinning point bumps were seen to get smaller.
""As we go through the decadal snapshots, you see these bumps in general getting smaller and sometimes completely disappearing,"" Dr Miles said.
""The thing to remember is that once an ice shelf loses contact with a pinning point, it's very difficult to regain contact, because you get a dynamical response in the ice: it starts to speed up and the grounding line - the line where the glacier is still touching the seabed - starts to retreat,"" he told BBC News.
What's interesting about this study is that it's used a different approach from how the thinning of ice shelves is normally assessed.
This is done using a specific type of satellite called an altimeter, which sends down radar pulses to very precisely measure the height of the ice surface.
But this gold standard technique only goes back 30 years to the early 90s.
By using the proxy of the ice bumps in the Landsat images, the record of thinning observations can be pushed back a further two decades.
This deeper history gave us a much better grasp of where and when ice loss really got going, said Edinburgh co-worker Prof Rob Bingham.
""The Landsat record shows you, for example, that those well known, big glaciers in West Antarctica -  Pine Island and Thwaites - were quite unusual in that there was change happening on them already in the 1970s,"" he explained.
""But in a lot of other places, and certainly in their sector around the Amundsen Sea where the thinning is completely pervasive now - you didn't see that happening until the 1990s.""
Prof Helen Fricker from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego observes ice shelves with satellite altimeters. She commended the Edinburgh research.
""Floating shelves are to the ice sheet as flying buttresses are to buildings - they provide structural support and prop the ice sheet up.
""Pinning points increase this effect, and as contact is lost, the support weakens. So by focussing on pinning points, this beautiful study has assessed the stability of the support of Antarctica and how and where it is weakening,"" she told BBC News.

2024-01-09T18:22:03.000Z,US Moon mission has no chance of soft lunar landing,BBC News,"A US lunar lander has ""no chance"" of making a soft landing on the Moon due to a fuel leak, the company behind the mission says.
Pittsburgh-based Astrobotic said there was enough propellant to operate its Peregrine lander as a spacecraft.
The lander is expected to run out of fuel in about 40 hours, the firm said shortly after 17:00 GMT on Tuesday.
Peregrine ran into trouble almost as soon as it came off the top of its launch rocket on Monday.
""Given the propellant leak, there is, unfortunately, no chance of a soft landing on the Moon,"" Astrobotic said in a statement posted on X, formerly Twitter.
""The team has updated its estimates, and we currently expect to run out of propellant in about 40 hours from now - an improvement on last night's estimate.
""The team continues to work to find ways to extend Peregrine's operational life.""
The 1.2-tonne lander was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, at 02:18 ET (07:18 GMT) on Monday, with the intention of landing in late February.
But in the first few hours of its journey, engineers noticed the would-be Moon lander was struggling to keep its solar panels looking in the direction of the Sun to charge its battery.
The cause was quickly attributed to a major leak in the propulsion system that was pushing Peregrine out of alignment.
To maintain the correct orientation in flight, Peregrine's thrusters are now having to work overtime, consuming even more of the diminishing fuel supply.
Astrobotic calculates the craft has under two days' worth of propellant left before reserves are exhausted and the spacecraft starts tumbling.
When that moment arrives, Peregrine, with its solar panels no longer collecting sunlight, will rapidly lose power.
Even before Tuesday's announcement from Astrobotic, it had become clear that a touch-down on the lunar surface - the first for the US in half a century - was all but impossible.
The US space agency, Nasa, had purchased capacity on the lander for five instruments to study the lunar surface environment ahead of sending astronauts there later this decade.
Astrobotic is the first of three US companies to send a lander to the Moon this year under a new private-public partnership with Nasa.
Alongside two other commercial ventures - Intuitive Machines and Firefly - they had planned six missions to the lunar surface in 2024.
Nasa believes its new lunar partnership with the private sector will introduce more innovation and reduce costs over time. And the agency says it is prepared for some of these missions not to work.
The Peregrine craft was launched aboard the first flight of Vulcan, a rocket that had been under development for a decade by United Launch Alliance (ULA), a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin.

2024-01-16T09:16:57.000Z,"What are El Niño and La Niña, and how do they change the weather?",BBC News,"It has been confirmed that 2023 was the hottest year on record, driven by human-caused warming but also boosted by a natural weather system called El Niño.
The continuing effects of El Niño mean that 2024 could see even higher temperatures.
El Niño is part of the natural climate phenomenon called the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO).
It has two opposite states: El Niño and La Niña, both of which significantly alter global weather.
An El Niño event is typically declared when sea surface temperatures in the tropical eastern Pacific rise to at least 0.5C above the long-term average.
In normal conditions, surface water in the Pacific Ocean is cooler in the east and warmer in the west.
The ""trade winds"" tend to blow east-to-west, and heat from the Sun progressively warms the waters as they move in this direction.
During El Niño events, these winds weaken or reverse, sending warm surface waters eastwards instead.
In La Niña periods, the normal east-to-west winds become stronger, pushing warmer waters further west.
This causes cold water to rise up - or ""upwell"" - from the depths of the ocean, meaning sea surface temperatures are cooler than usual in the east Pacific.
The phenomenon was first observed by Peruvian fisherman in the 1600s, who noticed that warm waters seemed to peak near the Americas in December.
They nicknamed it ""El Niño de Navidad"" - Christ Child in Spanish.
Not every ENSO event is the same, and the consequences vary from region to region. However, scientists have observed some common effects:
Temperatures
Global temperatures typically increase during an El Niño episode, and fall during La Niña.
El Niño means warmer water spreads further, and stays closer to the surface. This releases more heat into the atmosphere, creating wetter and warmer air.
But the regional effects are complicated, and some places may be both warmer and cooler than expected at different points in the year.
The hottest year on record, 2023, was boosted by El Niño conditions, on top of long-term human-caused warming.
El Niño could mean that 2024 is even hotter, the UK Met Office says, although this is far from certain.
Air temperatures typically peak a few months after El Niño hits maximum strength, as heat escapes from the sea surface to the atmosphere.
In early January 2024, El Niño was considered to be close to maximum strength, but it is expected to weaken in the coming months, according to the US science body NOAA.
Between 2020 and 2022, the world experienced an unusually long period of La Niña conditions, which helped keep a lid on global temperatures.
How UK and Western European temperatures respond to El Niño is complicated and uncertain. It could mean colder than average winters, for example, but that depends on how El Niño unfolds.
Changes to rainfall
During El Niño events, the warmer water pushes the Pacific jet stream's strong air currents further to the south and the east.
This brings wetter weather to southern USA and the Gulf of Mexico.
Tropical regions like southeast Asia, Australia and central Africa typically experience drier conditions.
Under La Niña, the effect is reversed.
Tropical storms
El Niño also affects atmospheric circulation patterns, which means there are generally more tropical storms in the tropical Pacific, but fewer in the tropical Atlantic, including the southern US.
During La Niña, the reverse is typically true.
Carbon dioxide (CO2) levels
Scientists have also observed that CO2 levels in the atmosphere increase during El Niño events, possibly as a result of warmer and drier conditions in tropical regions.
If plants grow less quickly due to drought, they absorb less CO2, while more wildfires in places like South Asia mean more CO2 is released.
The extreme weather events worsened by El Niño and La Niña affect infrastructure, food and energy systems around the world.
For example, when less cold water comes to the surface off the west coast of South America during El Niño events, fewer nutrients rise from the bottom of the ocean.
That means there is less food available for marine species like squid and salmon, in turn reducing stocks for South American fishing communities.
The droughts and flooding caused by the extreme 2015-16 El Niño event affected the food security of more than 60 million people, according to the UN Food and Agricultural Organisation.
A recent study suggested that El Niño events significantly reduce global economic growth, an effect which could intensify in the future.
El Niño and La Niña episodes typically occur every two to seven years, and usually last nine to 12 months.
They don't necessarily alternate: La Niña events are less common than El Niño episodes.
In 2021, the UN's climate scientists, the IPCC, said the ENSO events which have occurred since 1950 are stronger than those observed between 1850 and 1950.
But it also said that tree rings and other historical evidence show there have been variations in the frequency and strength of these episodes since the 1400s.
The IPCC concluded there is no clear evidence that climate change has affected these events.
Some climate models suggest that El Niño events will become more frequent and more intense as a result of global warming - potentially boosting temperatures further - but this is not certain.

2024-03-02T02:05:32.000Z,Killer whale v shark: Solo orca eats great white,BBC News,"A solitary killer whale, or orca, has been filmed hunting and killing a great white shark in an ""astonishing"" attack.
Scientists said it was ""unprecedented"" and showed the exceptional predatory skills of killer whales.
Two orcas in particular off South Africa's coast have been observed before working together to hunt and kill sharks, including great whites.
""But this caught us off guard,"" said shark biologist Dr Alison Towner.
Dr Towner, who is from Rhodes University in Grahamstown, South Africa, has studied the animals for several years. She and her colleagues published a detailed and grisly account of their new observations in the African Journal of Marine Science.
The attack - filmed in 2023, which you can watch here - was, scientists, said ""solo and swift"". The male killer whale killed the shark and consumed its liver - all in under two minutes.
Scientists first captured drone footage of two male orcas working together to hunt great white sharks in 2022.
The scientists then reported that the animals, nicknamed Port and Starboard because their dorsal fins are bent in opposite directions, ""exhibited a predilection for extracting and consuming the sharks' livers"".
During the attacks, the sharks would tightly circle the killer whales, in a desperate attempt to avoid predation,"" recalled Dr Towner.
In this newly reported attack, Starboard hunted on his own. Scientists described how the orca gripped the left pectoral fin of a 2.5m long juvenile shark and ""thrust forward several times before eventually eviscerating it"".
Marine mammal scientist Dr Luke Rendell from the University of St Andrews said it was ""a really beautiful observation"" of the behaviour.
""It's interesting that it's just one animal,"" he told BBC News, and how much skill it demonstrates in tackling the shark - ramming it in the side and grabbing the pectoral fin to keep away from those big, nasty jaws.
""A great white shark is a nice, big concentration of food, so it's perhaps unsurprising that some populations [of orcas], where these sharks occur in sufficient numbers, have learned to exploit that.""
It raises questions about how killer whale behaviour might be affecting the shark populations in the areas.
The scientists do not know what is driving the behaviour, but Dr Towner told BBC News that it was  becoming evident that ""human activities, like climate change and industrial fishing, are exerting significant pressures on our oceans"".
And there could be health repercussions for killer whales hunting sharks, including ingesting toxins and metals from shark flesh.
""Disruptions in the balance of apex predators can affect other species too,"" explained Dr Towner. ""Endangered African penguins could face increased predation by cape fur seals [if the fur seals are not being eaten by] white sharks.""
Dr Rendell pointed out that there was no way of knowing if the behaviour was new or simply observed for the first time. ""But what really stands out is how skilful these animals are as hunters.""
Dr Towner added that every discovery in these interactions [between orcas and sharks] was ""fascinating"".

2024-03-08T00:52:49.000Z,Mass die-offs among farmed salmon on the rise around the world,BBC News,"Hundreds of millions of farmed salmon have perished in mass die-offs over the past decade, say researchers.
The scientists say that large-scale mortalities are now happening more frequently and at a larger scale than ever before.
They argue that warmer seas and greater reliance on technology are contributing to the rise in deaths.
This global assessment looked at salmon deaths in some leading producers, including Norway, the UK and Canada.
Salmon farming has come a long way since the fish were first grown commercially in cages in Norway in the 1960s. The industry has expanded rapidly in recent decades, with around 70% of salmon eaten around the world now coming from farms.
But the aquaculture industry has long been controversial - with significant worries over disease among the fish, escapes to the wild and the overall environmental impact of raising them in cages.
Major mortality events, involving the sudden deaths of millions of fish have been well documented, sometimes caused by disease outbreaks but also linked to warmer seas resulting from climate change.
In Scotland last year, government data shows that more than 17 million salmon died, the most ever recorded. Producers blamed hotter oceans for the losses.
Other countries have experienced even greater mortality. Norway says close to 17% of their farmed fish died suddenly in 2023.
To shed some light on these deaths, researchers looked at data from countries producing 92% of farmed salmon over the past decade.
The scientists found 865 million instances of farmed salmon dying prematurely during this period.
They found that the frequency of the biggest die-offs was rising over time for Norway, Canada and the UK.
Not only were they increasing in frequency, the authors said, the die-offs were also getting bigger.
The authors estimate that the potential maximum losses for any single mass mortality event are 5.14 million fish in Norway, 5.05 million in Canada and more than one million in the UK.
A warming climate is playing a role say the authors - but so is the growing reliance on technology like underwater cameras and AI.
""An increasingly variable ocean environment, largely from climate change, may mean more production sites will be exposed to these events more often,"" said Dr Gerald Singh from the University of Victoria in Canada, the study's lead author.
""In addition, production practices, and technology that is increasingly pushing production into riskier conditions and allowing for greater production per site may expose larger and larger populations of fish to conditions that cause mortalities.""
The authors say that technology such as remote, real-time monitoring of fish farms can help justify placing them in sites farther offshore.
However, being further offshore may increase the threats and reduce the chances of operators spotting them early. So the increased reliance on the technology actually leads to greater risks for the fish.
Campaigners against salmon farming say this new study is ""alarming"" and underlines the fact that human decisions as well as warmer oceans are playing a role in the discomfort suffered by the fish.
""Mortality is only one of many grave welfare concerns for farmed salmon,"" said Kirsty Jenkins, a policy officer at campaigners OneKind.
""They are plagued by sea lice and disease, suffer from stressful handling and treatments, and live a monotonous life in barren, crowded cages.""
""The industry has shown itself to be incapable of, or unwilling to, reform, and it must be questioned if salmon farming has any place in a compassionate and sustainable food system.""
Some experts wonder if the industry can survive the increasing frequency of these mass die-offs in major production centres.
Dr Singh believes that aquaculture will continue globally, but that mass die-offs with huge clean-up costs might threaten future operations in many communities.
""It's probably unlikely that these events will negate or counter food production at an aggregate global level,"" he told BBC News.
""Instead, these events can have considerable local effects, especially considering welfare of coastal communities and for workers.""
The study has been published in the journal Scientific Reports.

2024-02-13T02:02:24.000Z,'Pirate of the seas' great skua in big decline after bird flu,BBC News,"A powerful bird known as the pirate of the seas has declined dramatically because of avian flu, the RSPB says.
Great skuas soar around the UK's coasts stealing other birds' food but their numbers in 2023 were down by 76%, the charity says in a report.
Populations of gannets and roseate terns were also seriously reduced after avian flu killed thousands of wild birds in 2021-22.
The numbers of the three species had been rising before the outbreak.
The H5N1 strain of avian flu spread to wild birds in summer 2021, causing thousands of creatures to die.
The findings make it clear that avian flu is ""one of the biggest immediate conservation threats faced by multiple sea-birds"", says the RSPB.
""This is a wake-up call as to how serious avian flu is and it's coming on top of multiple other threats that these species face,"" says Jean Duggan, RSPB avian influenza policy assistant.
The RSPB surveyed 13 bird species in May-July 2023, and concluded that avian flu had caused the decline of great skuas, gannets and roseate terns, and was very likely to have caused reductions of sandwich and common terns.
Gannet populations are down by 25%, roseate terns by 21%, sandwich terns by 35% and common terns by 42% compared with a major census of bird populations in 2015-2021.
Almost the entire UK population of great skuas live in Scotland. In 2022, at least 2,591 great skuas died - 1,400 from one colony alone on Foula island, Shetland.
The total number in the UK has declined from 9,088 to 2,160.
Ms Duggan highlighted that Britain was pivotal in protecting the bird worldwide because so many breed in Britain.
""It's empowering to realise that if we take the right actions in the UK it will actually benefit global populations to a very significant degree,"" she says.
Gannets were also badly affected in 2022, with 11,175 killed in Scotland and an estimated 5,000 mortalities at Grassholm in Wales.
In 2023 the total number counted in the UK had declined by 25%, going from 227,129 to 171,048.
Avian flu has become less acute in the UK in recent months, but it has caused mass mortalities of birds in other parts of the world.
In January it was detected in elephant and fur seals in Antarctica for the first time.
""While the virus is still present globally, UK birds are still at risk, and the virus will continue to mutate. We need to consider it a long-term threat,"" says Ms Duggan.
Climate change, mortality linked to fishing, the effects of offshore wind developments and a reduction in the availability of food are other threats facing UK sea-birds, according to the RSPB.

2024-02-05T00:41:07.000Z,Huge atom-smasher bid to find missing 95% of Universe,BBC News,"Researchers at the world's biggest particle accelerator in Switzerland have submitted proposals for a new, much larger, supercollider.
Its aim is to discover new particles that would revolutionise physics and lead to a more complete understanding of how the Universe works.
If approved, it will be three times larger than the current giant machine.
But its £12bn price tag has raised some eyebrows, with one critic describing the expenditure as ""reckless"".
That money - which is only the initial construction cost - would come from member nations of the European Organization for Nuclear Research (Cern) including the UK, and some experts have questioned whether it makes economic sense.
The biggest achievement of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) was the detection of a new particle called the Higgs Boson in 2012. But since then its ambition to track down two holy grails of physics - dark matter and dark energy - have proved elusive and some researchers believe there are cheaper options.
The new machine is called the Future Circular Collider (FCC). Cern's director general, Prof Fabiola Gianotti, told BBC News that, if approved, it will be a ""beautiful machine"".
""It is a tool that will allow humanity to make enormous steps forwards in answering questions in fundamental physics about our knowledge of the Universe. And to do that we need a more powerful instrument to address these questions,"" she said.
Inside the atom-smasher
Pallab Ghosh and Kate Stephens go inside the biggest particle accelerator in the world to find out why scientists want an even larger one.
Available now on BBC iPlayer
Cern is located on the border of Switzerland and France, near Geneva.
The LHC consists of an underground circular tunnel 27km in circumference. It accelerates the inside of atoms (hadrons) both clockwise and anticlockwise to speeds close to the speed of light and at certain points crashes them together harder than any other atom-smasher in the world can.
The smaller, sub-atomic particles left over from the collisions help scientists work out what atoms are made of and how they interact with each other.
The supercollider's detection of the Higgs Boson particle more than 10 years ago was ground-breaking.
The existence of a building block that gives all other particles in the Universe their form was predicted in 1964 by the British physicist, Peter Higgs, but was only discovered at the LHC in 2012. It was the final piece of the jigsaw of the current theory of sub-atomic physics, which is called the Standard Model.
The proposal is for the larger FCC to be built in two stages. The first will begin operating in the mid 2040s and will collide electrons together. It is hoped the increased energy will produce large numbers of Higgs particles for scientists to study in detail.
The second phase will begin in the 2070s and require more powerful magnets, so advanced that they have not yet been invented. Instead of electrons, heavier protons will be used in the search for brand new particles.
The FCC will be nearly three times the circumference of the LHC, a whopping 91km and twice as deep.
So why do they need an even larger hadron collider?
It is because the LHC, which cost £3.75 billion to build, and started operating in 2008, has not yet been able to find particles that will help to explain 95% of the cosmos.
Scientists are still searching for two big unknowns - a force called dark energy which acts like the opposite to gravity, and drives objects in the Universe such as galaxies apart. The other is dark matter, which can't be detected but its presence is felt through gravity.
""We are missing something big,'' Prof Gianotti tells us.
She says the FCC is needed because the discovery of these dark particles would lead to a new more complete theory of how the Universe works.
More than 20 years ago many researchers at Cern predicted that the LHC would find these mysterious particles. It didn't.
Critics, such as Dr Sabine Hossenfelder of the Munich Center for Mathematical Philosophy, say there is no guarantee that the new collider will succeed.
''Particle physics is a research area that is large and well-funded for historical reasons, having grown out of nuclear physics and it needs to shrink back to a reasonable size, maybe a tenth of its current size,"" she said.
A former UK government chief scientific advisor, Prof Sir David King, told BBC News he believed that spending £12bn on the project would be ''reckless''.
''When the world is faced with threats from the climate emergency, would it not be wiser to channel these research funds into the endeavours to create a manageable future?''
And there is also a debate among particle physicists themselves about whether a giant circular collider is the best option.
Prof Aidan Robson of Glasgow University told BBC News that a collider built in a straight line would be cheaper.
""There are three main advantages. First of all, a linear machine could be done stage by stage. Second, the cost profile would be rather different - so the initial stage would cost less; and, third, the tunnel is shorter, and you could do it quicker,"" he said.
But the FCC is Cern's preferred option. It is the result of a widespread consultation among physicists in Europe and worldwide, and it is in the process of gauging reaction to its proposal from its member nations, who will have to pay for the new machine.

2024-02-21T20:18:31.000Z,Pioneering European ERS-2 satellite burns up over Pacific,BBC News,"A European satellite that pioneered many of the technologies used to monitor the planet and its climate has fallen to Earth.
The two-tonne ERS-2 spacecraft burnt up in the atmosphere over the Pacific.
So far, there have been no eyewitness accounts of the mission's demise or of any debris reaching Earth's surface.
ERS-2 was one of a pair of missions launched by the European Space Agency in the 1990s to study the atmosphere, the land and the oceans in novel ways.
The duo monitored floods, measured continental and ocean-surface temperatures, traced the movement of ice fields, and sensed the ground buckle during earthquakes.
And ERS-2, specifically, introduced a new ability to assess Earth's protective ozone layer.
The satellite's return was expected, although uncontrolled. It had no functioning propulsion system to direct its fiery plunge.
Radars tracked its fall. Esa says the end came at 17:17 GMT (18:17 CET) +/- one minute, over the North Pacific Ocean between Alaska and Hawaii, about 2,000km west of California.
Esa's Earth Remote Sensing (ERS) spacecraft have been described as the ""grandfathers of Earth observation in Europe"".
""Absolutely,"" said Dr Ralph Cordey. ""In terms of technology, you can draw a direct line from ERS all the way through to Europe's Copernicus/Sentinel satellites that monitor the planet today. ERS is where it all started,"" the Airbus Earth observation business development manager told BBC News.
Dr Ruth Mottram is a glaciologist with the Danish Meteorological Institute. She recalled the revolution ERS brought to her discipline.
""When I was a university student in the 90s, we were told that the ice sheets were very cold and stable, and they weren't going to change much; it would take decades before we saw any of the kinds of changes we expected to see as a result of climate change. And ERS really showed that this wasn't true, and that there were big changes happening already.""
When ERS-2 ceased operations in 2011, it was commanded to lower its orbit from 780km above the Earth to an altitude of 570km. Controllers then ""passivated"" the satellite: its tanks were emptied and its battery system fully discharged.
The expectation was that the upper atmosphere would drag the spacecraft down to destruction in about 15 years - a prediction that held true on Wednesday.
In the 1990s, space debris mitigation guidelines were much more relaxed. Bringing home a redundant spacecraft within 25 years of end of operations was deemed acceptable.
Esa's new Zero Debris Charter recommends the disposal grace period now not exceed five years. And its future satellites will be launched with the necessary fuel and capability to propulsively de-orbit themselves in short order.
The rationale is obvious: with so many satellites now being launched to orbit, the potential for collisions is increasing. ERS-1 failed suddenly before engineers could lower its altitude. It is still more than 700km above the Earth. At that height it could be 100 years before it naturally falls down.
The American company SpaceX, which operates most of the functional satellites currently in orbit (more than 5,400), recently announced it would be bringing down 100 of them after discovering a fault that ""could increase the probability of failure in the future"". It wants to remove the spacecraft before any problems make the task more difficult.
Last week, the Secure World Foundation, an advocacy group for the sustainable use of space, and LeoLabs, a US company that tracks space debris, issued a pressing statement on the need to remove redundant orbital hardware.
They said: ""The accumulation of massive derelict objects in low Earth orbit continues unabated; 28% of the current long-lived massive derelicts were left in orbit since the turn of the century.
""These clusters of uncontrollable mass pose the greatest debris-generating potential to the thousands of newly deployed satellites that are fuelling the global space economy.""

2024-01-11T02:22:28.000Z,Kew Gardens names mysterious plants and fungi new to science,BBC News,"From an underground ""forest"" to spectacular orchids, scientists at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, discovered 74 new plants and 15 fungi last year.
Many of the mysterious species were found in unlikely places, such as on the top of a volcano or clinging to Antarctic rocks.
The new finds need immediate protection and at least one will probably already have been lost, the scientists say.
About three-quarters of undescribed plants are threatened with extinction.
The top-10 species described as new to science in 2023 are a reminder of the beauty and wonder of the natural world - and a stark warning of the dangers of biodiversity loss and climate change, the researchers say.
Giving a species a scientific name was the first step towards putting protections in place and investigating potential uses for humanity, senior research leader Dr Martin Cheek said.
""The sheer sense of wonder when you realise that you've found a species that is totally unknown to the rest of the world's scientists and in fact everyone else on the planet, in many cases, is what makes life worth living,"" he told BBC News.
""It's a huge boost.""
Kew's top-10 global discoveries for 2023 include:
Antarctica is virtually devoid of flowering plants - but lichens can gain a foothold on small areas of exposed bare rock.
Only 5-10% of all existing fungal species are known - found not just in remote unexplored areas but everywhere on the planet.
Among this incredible diversity ""we are bound to discover new sources of food, medicines and other useful active compounds that can help us find nature-based solutions to some of the biggest challenges we face today,"" Kew's fungi expert, Dr Raquel Pino-Bodas, said.
The plant, with spectacular bright red flowers, was found living on the summit of Mount Nok - an extinct volcano on the Indonesian island of Waigeo.
The palm, named Pinanga subterranea, was found on the island of Borneo, in South East Asia.
The bright red fruits and flowers are largely buried underground.
The strange plant (Crepidorhopalon droseroides), from the mint family, attracts and traps insects using sticky hairs - and may digest them for food - but is unrelated to other carnivorous plants.
""I put my money on it being proved as carnivorous scientifically in the next few years,"" Dr Cheek said.
""And if that is verified, this will be a new occurrence of the evolution of carnivorous plants being recorded.""
The trees were discovered growing beneath the Kalahari sands of highland Angola, in central Africa.
Only small parts, such as the flowers, are visible on the surface.
One, known as Baphia arenicola or ""growing on sand"", belongs to the bean family and has white flowers. The second, Cochlospermum adjanyae, has bright yellow flowers.
""This is such a curiosity for scientists and here are two new species of these very little but very curious underground forests,"" Dr Cheek said.
The plant has survived thanks to a strange beautiful bird with a blue beak, known as the helmet vanga, which attracts visitors.
Villagers have maintained pockets of forest where the bird lives, in turn safeguarding the habitat of the orchids, which sport pale translucent flowers.
Other discoveries include:
On average, scientists name about 2,500 new species of plants and 2,500 new species of fungi every year - and it is estimated there are as many as 100,000 plants yet to be formally identified.
For fungi, the figure is much higher.

2024-02-13T16:14:40.000Z,Climate change: Polar bears face starvation threat as ice melts,BBC News,"Some polar bears face starvation as the Arctic sea ice melts because they are unable to adapt their diets to living on land, scientists have found.
The iconic Arctic species normally feed on ringed seals that they catch on ice floes offshore.
But as the ice disappears in a warming world, many bears are spending greater amounts of time on shore, eating bird's eggs, berries and grass.
However the animals rapidly lose weight on land, increasing the risk of death.
The polar bear has become the poster child for the growing threat of climate change in the Arctic, but the reality of the impact on this species is complicated.
While the number of bears plummeted up to the 1980s this was mainly due to unsustainable hunting.
With greater legal protection, polar bear numbers have risen. But increasing global temperatures are now seen as their biggest threat.
That's because the frozen Arctic seas are key to their survival.
The animals use the sea ice as a platform to hunt ringed seals, which have high concentrations of fat, mostly in late spring and early summer.
But during the warmer months many parts of the Arctic are now increasingly ice-free.
In Western Manitoba where this study was carried out, the ice-free period has increased by three weeks between 1979 and 2015.
To understand how the animals survive as the ice disappears, researchers followed the activities of 20 polar bears during the summer months over a three-year period.
As well as taking blood samples, and weighing the bears, the animals were fitted with GPS-equipped video camera collars.
This allowed the scientists to record the animals movements, their activities and what they ate.
In the ice-free summer months, the bears adopted different strategies to survive, with some essentially resting and conserving their energy.
The majority tried to forage for vegetation or berries or swam to see if they could find food.
Both approaches failed, with 19 of the 20 bears in the study losing body mass, by up to 11% in some cases.
On average they lost one kilogramme per day.
""Regardless of which strategy they were trying to use, there was no real benefit to either approach as far as being able to prolong the period that they could survive on land,"" according to lead author Dr Anthony Pagano, from the US Geological Survey in Alaska.
""Polar bears are not grizzly bears wearing white coats,"" said co-author Charles Robbins from the Washington State University Bear Center.
""They're very, very different.""
Two of the three bears that took to the water found carcasses of dead animals but spent only a short time eating, as they were too tired from their exertions.
""One sub-adult female found a dead beluga whale, she took a couple of bites from it, but she mostly used it as a buoy to rest on,"" Dr Pagano told BBC News.
""It really suggests to us that that these bears can't eat and swim at the same time.""
An intriguing finding in the study was that one bear gained 32kg in weight.
The researchers believe that this bear, who had spent much of his time resting and conserving his strength, was fortunate to stumble across an animal carcass.
While previous research has outlined the challenges that climate poses over the decades to come, this new work raises important questions about the species' ability to adapt.
However other researchers say the impacts of climate change on polar bears would differ, depending on location.
""It is likely polar bears will disappear from areas where sea ice will be lost in future, but difficult to say just when and where,"" said Jon Aars from the Norwegian Polar Institute who was not involved in the study.
""Some areas will have good conditions for bears also many decades from now.""
""The area of this study is one where conditions may be very difficult for bears within a short time, if sea ice continues to disappear as predicted.""
The study has been published in Nature Communications.

2024-02-23T14:38:52.000Z,First commercial Moon mission marks new era for space travel,BBC News,"The landing of a first commercial spacecraft on the Moon has sparked excitement about a new age of possibilities in the Solar System.
News of the touchdown of Odysseus near the lunar south pole was greeted with cheers by staff at American firm Intuitive Machines' (IM) mission control in Houston, Texas, on Thursday.
It is the first time an American craft has successfully landed on the Moon since 1972 - and the first time ever that a private company has done so.
But the giant leap for commercial kind could also help future state missions to the lunar surface and perhaps even aid plans to set up a lunar - or Martian - base for humans.
Neil deGrasse Tyson, one of America's most famous astrophysicists, believes missions of this kind ""should have been happening decades ago"".
But he told the BBC's Americast that further state-funded missions might be needed before many private businesses look seriously at opportunities in space, given the level of up-front funding needed to get ventures off the ground.
""There is no business case to go into space first,"" Mr deGrasse Tyson argued.
He suggested that if the US put a base on Mars then ""after that's done, the expensive way, private enterprise can say 'well, maybe there is another way to get there that is cheaper'.
""Maybe you set up an amusement park or a tourist visiting site if it's cheap enough.
""But if you can't get the price down then it's not going to happen.""
There are hopes that the touchdown could plant the seeds of a wider, thriving lunar economy. The vision involves a range of companies buying and selling services such as transport, communication and power.
Nasa is trying to encourage firms to get involved in exploration beyond Earth, with the US space agency engaging a number of companies to take its scientific instruments to the Moon. These private entities build, launch and operate their missions.
Nasa purchased room on Odysseus for six scientific instruments, and some of its equipment helped the robot craft overcome technical issues - demonstrating the capacity for private and state actors to co-operate successfully in the space exploration industry.
The mission is part of Nasa's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) programme, in which the agency is paying various private American companies for transport services to the Moon - in this particular case, with a fee of $118M (£93m).
IM's effort follows that of another private entity, Pittsburgh-based Astrobotic, which set off for the Moon in early January but could not even attempt a landing because of technical problems.
IM, which claims to ""open access to the Moon for the progress of humanity"", was founded by Kam Ghaffarian, Stephen Altemus and Tim Crain - all of whom have significantly lower profiles than the likes of Elon Musk and Richard Branson.
That billionaire duo have both tried their hands at different forms of private space exploration - with varying degrees of success - and are planning further forays.
Many firms will see the risks and costs involved as reason enough to remain Earth-bound.
But other companies are also hoping to get involved in trips to the Moon, which had seen relatively little interest compared with the much-hyped - and state-based - ""Space Race"" of the mid to late 20th Century.
Only a handful of other countries have since successfully landed a spacecraft on the Moon's surface - the state space programmes of the then Soviet Union, China, India and Japan.
Yet in Europe, too, interest now appears to be picking up. Some of Odysseus' communications are being facilitated by Goonhilly Ltd in Cornwall, UK, which has several large radio dishes capable of picking up signals from the Moon's surface.
Nearby Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd, of Guildford, is building a telecoms spacecraft that will circle the Moon to provide a relay service to anyone who needs to get data back to the Earth.
Meanwhile, Nasa has a shortlist of lunar locations to send astronauts to later this decade in its Artemis programme - and one of them is Odysseus' targeted landing site, known as Malapert.
It is the southernmost point on the Moon ever visited by a spacecraft, and scientists think there could be frozen water nearby which could be vital to future missions.
But the key question is how sustainable a lunar economy can become long-term.
Will there be enough activity at the Moon to justify investors' courage in building the emerging infrastructure?
For the foreseeable future, government funding will have to prop up this industry.
That all means it may be quite some time before a thriving lunar economy is able to establish itself.

2024-01-09T11:16:58.000Z,Peregrine lander: Time running out for US Moon mission,BBC News,"The American company that launched a mission on Monday to try to soft-land on the Moon says it may not be able to control its spacecraft for much longer.
Pittsburgh-based Astrobotic is fighting a fuel leak from its Peregrine lander, which is making it hard to maintain stable pointing of the spacecraft.
Mission life could now be measured in just hours, the firm said.
Certainly, a touch-down on the lunar surface - the first for the US in half a century - is no longer possible.
""At this time the goal is to get Peregrine as close to lunar distance as we can before it loses the ability to maintain its Sun-pointing position and subsequently loses power,"" a statement from Astrobotic read.
The 1.2-tonne lander was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, with the intention of landing on the Moon's northern hemisphere in late February.
The US space agency (Nasa) had purchased capacity on the lander for five instruments to study the lunar surface environment ahead of sending astronauts there later this decade.
Peregrine ran into trouble almost as soon as it came off the top of its launch rocket.
Engineers noticed the would-be Moon lander was struggling to keep its solar panels looking in the direction of the Sun to charge its battery.
The cause was quickly attributed to a major leak in the propulsion system that was pushing Peregrine out of alignment.
To maintain the correct orientation in flight, Peregrine's thrusters are now having to work overtime, consuming even more of the diminishing fuel supply.
Astrobotic calculates the craft has under two days' worth of propellant left before reserves are exhausted and the spacecraft starts tumbling.
When that moment arrives, Peregrine, with its solar panels no longer collecting sunlight, will rapidly lose power.
Astrobotic is the first of three US companies to send a lander to the Moon this year under a new private-public partnership with Nasa.
The agency is buying transport services from the Pittsburgh firm and two other commercial ventures - Intuitive Machines and Firefly. Together, the trio had planned six missions to the lunar surface in 2024. Astrobotic is supposed to be delivering a Nasa rover to Earth's natural satellite towards the end of the year.
All three US companies may have Nasa as their lead ""customer"", but the agency is not in charge of their projects. It is the firms themselves who have designed the spacecraft and are in command as the missions progress. And the companies are free to sell additional payload space to anyone who wishes to purchase it.
Peregrine, for example, is carrying some mini rovers for US and Mexican groups. It also has a consignment of human, and even dog, remains on board. Small capsules contain the ashes of tens of individuals, including Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry and his wife, Majel, who was the voice of the computer on the USS Enterprise.
Nasa believes its new lunar partnership with the private sector will introduce more innovation and reduce costs over time. And the agency says it is prepared for some of these missions not to work.
Speaking to the BBC last month, deputy administrator Pam Melroy, said: ""What we have learned from our commercial partners is if we have a high enough cadence, we can relax some of the requirements that make it so costly, and have a higher risk appetite. And if they fail, the next one is going to learn and succeed.""
It will of course be frustrating for all those involved in the Peregrine project to see it fail.
Dr Simeon Barber from the UK's Open University led the development of the sensor in one Nasa instrument on the spacecraft. He told BBC News: ""We started work on this particular project in 2019; it's been four years. The instrument was built through a pandemic; it was tough. This new way of doing space exploration does come with inherent risks. We know it's harder to do things right first time. So, the whole point of having a fleet of missions to the Moon in future years is to increase the chances of success.""

2024-02-14T09:50:43.000Z,Trillion-tonne iceberg A23a spins on the spot,BBC News,"Like a dainty ballerina, the world's biggest iceberg has just completed a perfect pirouette.
The near-trillion-tonne frozen block, A23a, began its spin at the beginning of the year, while holding broadly the same position just north of the Antarctic Peninsula.
The berg is expected shortly to step into a powerful current that will sweep it away into the Southern Ocean.
A23a covers an area more than twice that of Greater London.
The video on this page comes from the US space agency's Modis satellite sensor system.
A23a broke from the Antarctic coast in 1986, before grounding itself on a shallow part of the Weddell Sea floor for three decades.
Only in the past couple of years has the berg made serious progress in trying to get away from the continent.
Recent weeks, though, have seen its northward drift slow somewhat.
A23a is currently turning on its heels in a stretch of water between Elephant Island and the South Orkney Islands - small parcels of land at the tip of the peninsula.
It cannot be seen in the satellite imagery - but A23a is loitering just behind the South Scotia Ridge, which is like a submerged continuation of the peninsula.
Once the berg crosses over this ridge, it will enter the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, one of the most powerful movements of water on the planet.
And this should push A23a, aided by strong westerly winds, to the north-east.
It is essentially following the major route for the export of ice from the continent - what scientists call ""iceberg alley"".
The interplay of winds, ocean fronts and eddies will determine A23a's precise course over the coming weeks but many of these giant flat-topped, or tabular, bergs end up passing by the British Overseas Territory of South Georgia.
Recent close-up photographs from visiting ships show the berg wasting at its edges.
Waves are cutting into its walls and chunks are breaking off to form a surrounding armada of football-pitch-sized ""bergy bits"" and lorry-sized ""growlers"".
Today, A23a still covers an area of about 3,800 sq km (1,470 sq miles) but the processes of erosion and melting will only accelerate as it journeys further into rougher and warmer waters.

2024-03-11T18:02:07.000Z,South Georgia: Bird flu infects penguins at famous wildlife haven,BBC News,"Bird flu has been confirmed in 10 penguins on South Georgia, one of the world's great wildlife havens.
Avian influenza had already infected other seabirds and mammals on the British Overseas Territory, but scientists report gentoo and king penguins have now fallen victim, too.
The breeding season is closing on the sub-Antarctic island so the immediate impacts are likely to be limited.
But there'll be concern for next season when wildlife gathers again en masse.
The beaches on South Georgia are famous for their spectacular aggregations - a million-plus individuals all jostling together to court, mate and bring up their young.
""I liken South Georgia to the Alps with Serengeti-style wildlife around it. The wildlife concentrations around the coast are just phenomenal - multiple species of penguins, albatrosses, and seals,"" explained Dr Norman Ratcliffe, a bird ecologist from the British Antarctic Survey.
""If bird flu were to take a hold and cause very high mortality across the island, it would be of conservation concern globally. But at the moment, it does seem to be somewhat limited in the way it's spreading,"" he told BBC News.
High Pathogenicity Avian Influenza (HPAI) has been in existence for decades but the world is currently in the grip of a major flare up, with the H5N1 strain of the virus causing the deaths of countless wild and domesticated birds.
Antarctica and its outlying islands have escaped the worst due to their remoteness. But this situation is on the turn.
Bird flu was first identified on South Georgia in October 2023, in the large scavenging seabird known as the brown skua, with detections in kelp gulls shortly after.
Then, in January this year, cases were confirmed in elephant and fur seals.
It's also spread to Antarctic terns and wandering albatrosses.
Penguins are the latest animal group to be infected, with five gentoos and five kings testing positive.
The cases were confirmed in samples sent back to the UK to the International Reference Laboratory for Avian Influenza at the Animal & Plant Health Agency (APHA) laboratories in Weybridge.
It's not a great surprise. The virus has already got to gentoos on the Falklands some 1,500km to the west, so it was probably only a matter of time before South Georgia's also became infected.
""Skuas winter around South America as do giant petrels and we think these birds are the vector that bought the disease into South Georgia,"" said Dr Ratcliffe.
""Skuas are constantly in amongst the penguin colonies scavenging and preying on eggs and chicks. If there's a surprise, it's that it's taken this long for the virus to be manifested in the penguins.""
Scientists are watching closely now to see how bird flu interacts with the different penguin species, which on South Georgia include kings, gentoos, macaronis and chinstraps.
Macaronis, for example, will spend much of the coming southern winter at sea, which will help them avoid infection. Kings and gentoos, however, will continue to roost on shore, leaving them open to further exposure.
As for the Antarctic proper, two dead skuas infected with HPAI were recently picked up by Argentine scientists near their Primavera base on the continent's peninsula, so the virus is unquestionably moving south.
But how far it would progress and what its impacts might be was highly uncertain, said Dr Ashley Banyard, who leads the avian virology workgroup at the APHA.
""Penguins live in very close proximity to each other, so that lends itself to the idea that they might spread the virus rapidly between each other. But we don't know how easily the virus can get into different penguin species, what sort of clinical disease it might cause and how rapidly it might spread between birds themselves,"" he told BBC News.
Surveillance is key, and this is being assisted by the many cruise ships that now sail in Antarctic waters.
Members of the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO) have long had protocols to prevent the accidental spread of disease by tourists in pristine environments, but these have now been stepped up because of bird flu.
""Nobody lands on a beach until there's been an assessment done to show if there's any strange behaviour or high mortality,"" said Amanda Lynnes, the director of environment and science coordination at IAATO.
""Antarctica is a huge continent but we're actually quite a small community in a way, so the information flow goes rapidly to all stakeholders who need to know and can advise.""

2024-02-10T01:52:01.000Z,Is Iceland entering a new volcanic era?,BBC News,"This week, Iceland woke up to yet another day of fire, as towering fountains of lava lit up the dark morning sky.
This time the evacuated town of Grindavik was spared, but the molten rock still wreaked havoc - engulfing a pipe that provides heat and hot water to thousands living in the area and cutting off a road to the Blue Lagoon tourist attraction.
It is the third short-lived eruption on the Reykjanes peninsula since December 2023 and the sixth since 2021.  But scientists think this is just the start of a period of volcanic activity that could last for decades or even centuries.
So what is going on?
Iceland is no stranger to volcanoes - it is one of the most volcanically active places in the world.
That is because the country is positioned above a geological hotspot, where plumes of hot material deep within the Earth rise towards the surface.
But Iceland also sits on the boundary between the Eurasian and North America tectonic plates. These plates are very slowly pulling apart from each other, creating a space for hot molten rock - or magma - to flow up.
As the magma builds up underground, the pressure increases until it breaks through the surface in an eruption (at this point the hot rock is called lava).
There are more than 100 volcanoes across Iceland and more than 30 are currently active.
But the last time the Reykjanes peninsula saw any lava flow was hundreds of years ago - that may have started as early as the 8th or 9th Century and continued until 1240.
Now the eruptions have started again - but why has there been an 800-year gap?
""Over geological time, the tectonic plates are pulling apart at about the speed that your fingernails grow, so a few centimetres a year,"" explains Prof Tamsin Mather, an Earth scientist from the University of Oxford.
""But they don't seem to smoothly pull apart - they go through these pulses of higher activity. And this is likely what we're seeing right now in the Reykjanes.""
The rocks in the region can reveal even more about the past - and they show a pattern of periods of quiet lasting around 1,000 years - followed by eruptions that continue for a few centuries.
""There's evidence for about three of these types of episodes in the last 4,000 years in this area"" Prof Mather explains.
""So this is proceeding as expected at the moment. And what we're expecting is a series of these relatively small, relatively short-lived eruptions over the coming years and decades.""
Working out how to predict when the eruptions will happen is a key concern for Iceland right now - especially as the town of Grindavik and a geothermal power plant - a key piece of national infrastructure - are in the danger zone.
""Now that the eruptions are repeating themselves, scientists have a much better idea of what is happening,"" explains Dr Evgenia Ilyinskaya, a volcanologist from the University of Leeds.
""So they've been tracking how the ground is inflating as magma is coming out from deep below. And now they actually can tell with a lot more certainty than was possible when to expect the magma to start breaking through the ground.""
But pinpointing exactly where an eruption will happen is harder. These aren't cone-shaped volcanoes like Italy's Mount Etna, for example, where the lava comes out at more or less the same place.
In the Reykjanes Peninsula, the magma is held more loosely under a larger area - and it erupts through cracks - or fissures - that can be miles long.
The Icelandic authorities are building large barriers around the town and power station - and these are good at holding lava back.
But if a fissure opens up inside the barriers - as was the case in Grindavik in January when some houses were destroyed - not much can be done.
A long period of eruptions will have major consequences for Iceland.
""This is the most densely populated part of Iceland - so 70% of the population lives within 40km or so,"" explains Dr Ilyinskaya.
""And all of the key infrastructure is there - so the main international airport, big geothermal power plants, and a lot of tourist infrastructure too, which is a big part of Iceland's economy.""
Key roads being cut off by lava flow and air pollution from the eruptions are just some of the risks.
The country's capital Reykjavik also has the potential to be impacted, says Dr Ilyinskaya.
""One scenario that would be hazardous for Reykjavik (Iceland's capital) is if the eruptions move further east along the peninsula - there are lava flows from 1,000 years ago from the last eruptive cycle that are in what is now Reykjavik, so based on that it is not unfeasible that the lava flows could flow there in future eruptions""
So is there a way to predict what will happen in the longer term?
Scientists are looking at a number of different volcanic systems that sit across the peninsula.
""In the last cycle, the first eruptions started in the systems to the east and migrated to the west, with a few fits and starts here and there,"" explains Dr Dave McGarvie from Lancaster University.
This time, the first eruptions - which started in 2021 - happened in a system that sits more in the middle of the peninsula.
""That system now just seems to have completely switched off - there's no clear indication of a gathering of magma beneath it. We don't know whether that's temporary or whether it's a permanent thing and it may never erupt again in this cycle.""
The most recent eruptions, which began in December, are now in a neighbouring system a little further west.
Dr McGarvie says scientists can get an idea of how much magma is held underground - and whether it is likely to shift away from Grindavik and the power station to another neighbouring volcanic system.
""If they saw the rate of magma inflow declining, then that would be an indication that perhaps it's starting to switch off and if so it may take a few months for it to completely die down.
""The question then would be is this a temporary lull or is it actually the end of this phase of activity - we're into unknown territory at that point.""
Scientists are learning more with every eruption, but there's still a great deal of uncertainty for Iceland as a new volcanic era begins.

2024-03-07T00:04:50.000Z,Robot ships: Huge remote controlled vessels are setting sail,BBC News,"It sounds like science fiction. Ocean-going ships with no-one on board. But this vision of the future is coming - and sooner than you might think.
You can glimpse it in a Norwegian fjord where a huge, lime-green vessel is being put through its paces. At first glance, it seems like any other ship. Look closer, though, and you suddenly see all the hi-tech kit. Cameras, microphones, radars, GPS and all manner of satellite communications.
""We've added a lot of additional equipment and designed her especially to be what we call 'robotic',"" says Colin Field, the head of remote systems at US-UK company Ocean Infinity (OI).
The ship is part of OI's new ""Armada"" - a fleet eventually of 23 vessels - that will survey the seabed for offshore wind farm operators and check underwater infrastructure for the oil and gas industry.
Strikingly for a ship that's 78m (255ft) in length there are only 16 people on board. A traditional ship carrying out the same kind of work would need a crew of 40 or 50. OI believes it can reduce the numbers still further.
That's because many of the roles can be done hundreds of miles away on land.
Entering the company's remote operations centre in Southampton is like walking on to a futuristic film set. The dimly lit room is vast, and it's filled with 20 ""bridge stations"", each fitted with gaming-like controls and touch screens.
Operators sitting in their high-backed chairs watch a bank of monitors displaying a live stream coming from the ship's cameras and a multitude of sensors.
A key test for this new way of working is commanding an underwater robot - or remotely operated vehicle (ROV) - to descend from the deck to scan the seafloor.
""It's amazing how everything is automated,"" says ROV trainee pilot Marian Meza Chavira. ""In some ways it's easier here than offshore because you have so many more cameras for context.""
Autonomy, robotics and remote operation, along with artificial intelligence, will transform all transport sectors. Maritime will be no different and experiments are under way around the globe.
In Norway, for example, there's an 80m (262ft) electric container ship running back and forth between a fertiliser plant and a local port. In Belgium and Japan there are ferries autonomously navigating between destinations, berthing and unberthing at each location. And in China, too, big autonomous container ships shuttle between coastal cities.
The advantages are obvious. With fewer people on board, ships can be smaller, which means they require less fuel and have a much reduced carbon footprint.
Rudy Negenborn researches autonomous shipping at Delft University of Technology. He says the hi-tech systems needed to fully replace crew are developing at speed but still have some way to go.
""We've had autopilots that let ships follow a path by themselves. That's not so challenging. The challenges come when interacting with other traffic or a port, or when there are unforeseen situations or bad weather circumstances,"" he told BBC News.
""But in the end, this is going to lead to safer, more efficient and more sustainable transport over water. I'm sure about that.""
Robot ships: The technology that's going to revolutionise ocean transport
Available now on BBC iPlayer
Some smaller vessels are already allowed to work with no-one onboard at all.
The British company Sea-Kit International is designing and building a fleet of these crewless boats.
One was recently sent to Tonga to map the still-active underwater volcano that blew up spectacularly in 2022, a task considered too dangerous to involve people.
We followed a 12m-long (39ft) boat, fresh from the factory, as it sailed out of Plymouth harbour to inspect a WWII wreck. The bright-red vessel called Vaquita was built for the Dutch survey company Fugro.
It cuts a lonely figure as it skims across the waves. It's being fully controlled by a crew 475 miles away in an office in Aberdeen.
Fugro captain Dmitrij Dadycin's commands, bounced via satellite, turn Vaquita nimbly one way and then the other. An ROV is deployed to go down to explore the sunken destroyer. All the while, cameras at the surface give a 360-degree view of the surrounding waters.
""There's more pleasure to work this way,"" says Dmitrij, who spent many years at sea.
""I definitely don't miss the pitching and rolling. And at the end of your shift, you get to go home.""
Many questions spring to mind about remotely operated and autonomous shipping, just as they do about driverless cars and trains and the drones that are increasingly filling our skies.
How will these technologies change the nature of work? Can they create new and different types of jobs to replace those they eliminate? How secure are the systems being developed - can they defend against cyber-attack and piracy? More fundamentally, are they robust and reliable enough? What happens if a satellite link falls over?
""Everything we do starts from the standpoint of safety,"" says Sea-Kit's operations director Ashley Skett from his workshop where the team is putting the finishing touches to another crewless boat.
""When this vessel is at sea, there's no-one on board to fix something if it goes wrong, so you must have an alternative system ready to step in. This vessel is built almost in two halves with two of everything on board. The clever bit is in software that enables the boat to switch seamlessly between systems.""
The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) is currently grappling with all the issues surrounding autonomy at sea. It hopes to introduce voluntary codes defining best practice by 2028, with a view eventually to making them mandatory.
As it stands, larger ships have to have a captain - or master - with them at sea.
""We're specifically going to be considering the role of the master and officers on board a ship in the context of a remote control centre,"" says IMO director Heike Deggim.
""Would you now consider a remote-control operator to be equivalent of a master on a ship? This needs further work.""
The UK government has already taken a view on this topic and desires to incorporate the idea of remote masters into legislation.
""There is a huge industry coming and the government obviously doesn't want to miss out on the opportunities. They want to see companies invest here and operate their vessels from here,"" observed shipping lawyer Fiona Cain from Haynes and Boone.
Back in the Norwegian fjord, Ocean Infinity captain Simon Macaulay definitely has his eyes on the horizon.
""I could foresee a situation where you have a master mariner who's in charge of a vessel remotely or a number of vessels remotely. Obviously that needs legislation change and part of what we're building up here is the knowledge and safety case. We send probes and satellites to the other side of the Solar System, so this can be done.""

2024-01-19T19:24:47.000Z,Japan lands on Moon but glitch threatens mission,BBC News,"A Japanese robot has successfully touched down on the Moon but problems with its solar power system mean the mission may live for just a few hours.
The Smart Lander for Investigating Moon (Slim) put itself gently on the lunar surface near an equatorial crater.
The feat made the Asian nation only the fifth country to soft-land on Earth's natural satellite, after the US, the Soviet Union, China and India.
Engineers are now battling to save the mission, however.
For reasons not yet fully understood, the craft's solar cells will not generate electricity.
This leaves Slim totally reliant on its batteries and these will eventually discharge. When they do, the craft will go silent. It won't receive commands and it won't be able to talk to Earth.
Engineers are currently prioritising activities.
They've turned off heaters and are pulling down pictures from the craft. They're also retrieving data that will tell them how well the landing software worked.
Japanese space agency (Jaxa) officials will not immediately give up on Slim if it does fall silent. It's always possible the solar cells have somehow become oriented in a way that prevents them from seeing the Sun.
As light angles change on the Moon, it was possible Slim could come back to life, the officials said.
Asked at a news conference whether Japan could justifiably claim a soft landing, Jaxa vice president, Hitoshi Kuninaka, said it could.
""If powered descent wasn't successful, then there would have been a collision with the surface at a very high speed and spacecraft function would have been completely lost,"" he told reporters.
""But it is still sending data properly to us, which means our original objective of a soft landing was successful.""
Slim was carrying two small rovers and telemetry indicates it managed to eject these as planned just before touchdown.
The craft, which carries an infrared camera, was to spend the next fortnight studying the local geology. How much of this investigation can be achieved in the time available is uncertain.
Statistically, it's proven very hard to land on the Moon. Only about a half of all attempts have succeeded.
Jaxa put its faith in new precision-navigation technologies.
The lander's onboard computer used rapid image processing and crater mapping to avoid hazards to reach its touchdown point.
Engineers had wanted to get within 100m (330ft) of their targeted location and will now be studying data to see how well Slim performed. But the early indications are that the technologies worked as designed.
""Looking at the trace data, I believe that Slim most certainly achieved a pinpoint landing with 100m accuracy. Of course, as we informed you in advance, it would take about a month to analyse the information accurately,"" Mr Kuninaka said.
Slim began its descent manoeuvres from an altitude of 15km (9 miles) at midnight into Saturday, Japan Standard Time (15:00 GMT, Friday). Touchdown occurred just after 15:20 GMT.
The landing location, near Shioli Crater, is currently bathed in sunlight but the darkness of lunar night will return there at the end of the month.
When that happens, temperatures will plummet to levels that are very capable of breaking electronic circuit boards.
Jaxa has twice landed robots on asteroids, so this Moon touchdown is another feather in its cap.
It will be playing significant roles in the US space agency's (Nasa) Artemis programme, which seeks to put humans back on the lunar surface after a gap of more than half a century.
Last year, a private Japanese company, iSpace, had a go at landing. Its Hakuto-R craft crashed when the onboard computer became confused about its altitude above the Moon.
On Thursday, the private American company Astrobotic disposed of its Peregrine landing craft in Earth's atmosphere. A propulsion fault prevented it from even trying to make a touchdown attempt.
Dr Simeon Barber from the UK's Open University had instrumentation on Peregrine.
He saluted the Japanese effort.
""For me, this was all about precision landing. That's a huge Success. I'd be really happy if I was them,"" he told BBC News.
""We're in an era of a lot of lunar missions happening with lots of different players. If we collate all this knowledge, that all these players are gaining through these attempts - whether successful or not - then we learn as a community how to put missions together more successfully in the future.""
Likewise, Dr Emma Gatti, from the digital magazine SpaceWatch Global, said Japan had much to celebrate: ""It's historic for them; it is a matter of prestige. It is important for Japan as a country; it's important for all the investment they have made - proof that it can be done by a country not as big as China or US.""

2024-02-08T14:30:59.000Z,Nuclear fusion: new record brings dream of clean energy closer,BBC News,"Nuclear fusion has produced more energy than ever before in an experiment, bringing the world a step closer to the dream of limitless, clean power.
The new world record has been set at the UK-based JET laboratory.
Nuclear fusion is the process that powers stars. Scientists believe it could produce vast amounts of energy without heating up our atmosphere.
European scientists working at the site said ""we have achieved things we've never done before"".
The result came from the lab's final experiment after more than 40 years of fusion research.
Andrew Bowie, UK Minister for Nuclear, called it a ""fitting swansong"".
Nuclear fusion is the process that powers the Sun. It works by heating and forcing tiny particles together to make a heavier one which releases useful energy.
If successfully scaled up to commercial levels it could produce endless amounts of clean energy without carbon emissions. And crucially unlike wind and solar energy would not be at the mercy of weather conditions.
But as Dr Aneeqa Khan, Research Fellow in Nuclear Fusion, University of Manchester explained, this is not straightforward.
""In order for the atoms to fuse together on Earth, we need temperatures ten times hotter than the Sun - around 100 million celsius, and we need a high enough density of the atoms and for a long enough time,"" she explained.
The experiments produced 69 megajoules of energy over five seconds. That is only enough energy for four to five hot baths - so not a lot.
It is clear we are still a long way off from nuclear fusion power plants, but with every experiment it is bringing us one step closer.
Prof Stuart Mangles, Head of the Space, Plasma and Climate Research Community, Imperial College London, said: ""The new results from JET's final run are very exciting.
""This result really highlights the power of international collaboration, these results wouldn't have been possible without the work of hundreds of scientists and engineers from across Europe.""
The Joint European Torus (JET) facility, was constructed in Culham in Oxford in the late 1970s and until the end of last year was the world's most advanced experimental fusion reactor. All experiments ceased in December.
Although based in the UK it was funded predominantly by the EU nuclear research programme, Euratom, and operated by the UK Atomic Energy Agency. For four decades it hosted scientists from the UK, Europe, Switzerland and Ukraine.
The reactor was only meant to be operational for a decade or so but repeated successes saw its life extended. The result announced today is triple what was achieved in similar tests back in 1997.
Prof Ambrogio Fasoli, programme manager at EUROfusion, said: ""Our successful demonstration... instils greater confidence in the development of fusion energy. Beyond setting a new record, we achieved things we've never done before and deepened our understanding of fusion physics.""
UK Minister for Nuclear and Networks, Andrew Bowie, said: ""JET's final fusion experiment is a fitting swansong after all the ground-breaking work that has gone into the project since 1983. We are closer to fusion energy than ever before thanks to the international team of scientists and engineers in Oxfordshire.""
But the future role of the UK in European fusion research has been unclear. Since Brexit the UK has been locked out of the Euratom programme and last year the government made the decision not to re-join.
Instead the government said it would commit £650m to national research programmes instead.
The Euratom successor to JET is a facility called ITER that will be based in France. Originally planned to be open in 2016 and cost around 5bn euros, its price has since roughly quadrupled and its start-up pushed back to 2025. Full-scale experiments are now not foreseen until at least 2035.
Although no reason was given for the UK government's decision not to re-join Euratom the delays with ITER are believed to have played a part. At the time a spokesperson for the Department of Energy Security and Net Zero said: ""Given delays to association and the direction of travel of these EU programmes, an alternative approach gives the UK the best opportunity to deliver our fusion strategy.""
At the announcement of the record on Thursday, Ian Chapman, from UKAEA, did say that discussions were still ongoing with European partners to see how the UK could be involved with ITER in the future.
The government is now hoping to build the world's first fusion power plant in Nottinghamshire with operations beginning in the 2040s. The Spherical Tokamak for Energy Production (STEP) project will be delivered by a new nuclear body, the UK Industrial Fusion Solutions.

2024-01-26T00:06:51.000Z,Hermit crabs are 'wearing' our plastic rubbish,BBC News,"Hermit crabs all over the world, which scavenge shells as armour for their bodies, are turning increasingly to plastic waste instead.
The conclusion is based on analysis of photos, taken by wildlife enthusiasts, and published online.
Scientists said they were ""heartbroken"" to see the extent to which the animals were living in our rubbish.
They said two-thirds of hermit crabs species were pictured in ""artificial shells"" - items that humans discarded.
The discovery is published in the journal Science of the Total Environment.
The study used social media and photo-sharing websites, as one of the researchers Marta Szulkin, an urban ecologist from the University of Warsaw, explained: ""We started to notice something completely out of the ordinary.
""Instead of being adorned with a beautiful snail shell, which is what we're used to seeing - they would have a red plastic bottle cap on their back or piece of light bulb.""
She and her colleagues, Zuzanna Jagiello from the University of Warsaw and Łukasz Dylewski, from Poznan University of Life Sciences, found a total of 386 individuals using artificial shells - mainly plastic caps.
""According to our calculations, 10 out of the 16 species of land hermit crabs in the world use this type of shelter and it's been  observed in all tropical regions of the Earth,"" Prof Szulkin explained.
It isn't yet clear whether these materials are harmful - or perhaps even helpful - for the small, vulnerable crustaceans.
""When I first saw these pictures, I felt it was heart-breaking,"" Prof Szulkin told BBC Radio 4's Inside Science. ""At the same time, I think we really need to understand the fact that we are living in a different era and animals are making use of what is available to them.""
This internet-based ecological study, revealed that this use of artificial shells is a ""global phenomenon"".
""We saw it in two-thirds of all terrestrial hermit crab species,"" said Prof Szulkin. ""That's what we could identify just by using pictures taken by tourists.""
The researchers say the findings open up new questions about how these coastal crustaceans interact with and use plastic. As well as understanding whether it causes them any harm, the scientists want to work out how it might affect their evolution.
This whole group of crabs have adapted to scavenge and use discarded snail shells to protect their fragile bodies. And when those shells are in short supply, the crabs will fight over them.
What we don't know is how much the element of novelty might affect them - and whether the crabs will fight over artificial plastic shells,"" explained Prof Szulkin.
The researcher said that the natural snail shells were in decline, so she suspected it might be becoming easier for the animals to find an artificial alternative. And lighter, plastic 'shells' might even help smaller, weaker crabs to survive because they are easier to carry.
There is certainly a great deal of plastic in the marine environment for the animals to choose from. A recent study that attempted to quantify the scale of plastic pollution estimated that at least 171 trillion pieces of plastic are now floating in our oceans.
That could nearly triple by 2040 if no action is taken, experts have warned.
But there is hope that 2024 could see nations finally sign up to a long-awaited global treaty to end the scourge of plastic.
Mark Miodownik, who is professor of materials and society at University College London told the BBC that there was a lesson for humans in these images. ""Just like the hermit crabs,"" he said, ""we should be reusing plastics much more, instead of discarding it.""

2024-01-08T07:57:21.000Z,Peregrine lander: Vulcan rocket launches US private Moon mission,BBC News,"An US spacecraft has launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, to try to perform a controlled landing on the Moon.
It's aiming to become the first American mission in 51 years to complete a soft touch-down, and the first ever by a private company.
Astrobotic's robotic lander, called Peregrine, has been contracted by Nasa to carry five scientific instruments.
These will study the Moon's surface environment ahead of human missions later this decade.
Peregrine is part of a stampede of spacecraft that will attempt to put themselves on the lunar surface in 2024 - possibly as many as eight different projects, including from Japan and China.
Astrobotic's venture was sent on its way by a brand new rocket called Vulcan, which left its Florida pad at 02:18 EST (07:18 GMT). Fifty minutes later, after a flawless flight, the Pittsburgh-based company's craft was ejected on a path to the Moon.
It will take a few weeks to get itself into position to attempt the touch-down.
The planned 23 February descent will target a smooth lava plain on the Moon's near-side known as Sinus Viscositatis, or ""Bay of Stickiness"" - a reference to the type of volcanic material that may have built nearby hills.
Not since the last Apollo mission in 1972 has there been any US effort to place a spacecraft gently on the lunar surface - although US probes have been deliberately crashed into the Moon for one reason or another in the meantime.
Running surface operations is back on the agenda because Nasa wishes soon to resume astronaut missions, and it is going to use robots from commercial partners to deliver scientific instrumentation, general equipment and supplies - a move the agency believes will work to reduce costs over time.
Astrobotic is the first of three US companies to send a lander under this new arrangement. Two other companies, Intuitive Machines and Firefly, will follow in the coming months.
Indeed, it's possible Houston-based Intuitive Machines may even beat Astrobotic to the surface because although its lander is not due to launch until mid-February, it's taking a quicker route to the Moon.
All three US companies have Nasa as a ""customer"", but the agency is ""not in charge"" of their missions. It is the firms themselves who have designed the spacecraft and will be in command as the missions progress.
""This initiative is incredibly important,"" said Andy Jones, director of landers and spacecraft at Astrobotic.
""It's allowed a small company like Astrobotic to deliver a lander to the Moon. We'd never have been able to achieve it without that. But the best thing is it's bringing a lot more creative minds, new minds, new thinking to the table, and that will help accelerate the technologies needed to get us back to the Moon and have a more robust presence on the Moon.""
Nasa's payloads on Peregrine are focused on preparations for the later human presence on the lunar surface.
The Peregrine Ion Mass Spectrometer (PITMS), for example, will try to understand better how water moves across the Moon. Water is seen as a potential resource for future astronauts, either for drinking or as the basis of a rocket fuel.
The main sensor in PITMS was built in the UK by the Open University (OU) and RAL-Space.
The OU's Dr Simeon Barber led the development. ""Water is really important for astronauts to drink, for sanitation. It's really the key molecule for unlocking the future and a new way of doing space exploration,"" he told BBC News.
Because Nasa is classed as just a customer on the mission, Astrobotic has been free to sell payload space to others. The most significant of these additional items are a number of small rovers, including a clutch of tiny two-wheeled robots from Mexico.
There are also cultural items onboard, such as photos, drawings, plaques and audio recordings, but, controversially, there is a consignment of cremated human remains, too. Two companies have small ""memorial"" capsules on Peregrine, one of which contains the DNA of renowned British science-fiction writer Arthur C Clarke.
This is something that has drawn the ire of the Navajo Nation, the North American indigenous people, who regard the Moon as sacred. They've appealed to Nasa to stop the mission, which they see as an act of desecration.
The first of 2024's lunar touch-down attempts will be conducted by the Japanese space agency (Jaxa) and is expected on 15 January.
Jaxa's Smart Lander for Investigating Moon (Slim) will target a location near Shioli crater, which is just south of the Moon's equator on its near-side.
China will continue its recent exploration efforts on the Moon by sending a mission to the far-side to bring some of the rocks there back to Earth for study. This should happen mid-year.
While the focus in the coming weeks will be squarely on Peregrine's travels, It's worth reflecting also on the success of the Vulcan, which was making its maiden flight after 10 years of development.
The company behind the vehicle - United Launch Alliance - has an established pedigree of putting up US national security missions and Nasa missions. Vulcan will take on this work as ULA's current stable of rockets is retired.
The company's president and CEO, Tory Bruno, couldn't hide his joy at the conclusion of the new rocket's ascent.
""Yeehaw!"" the executive, who is often seen in a cowboy hat, shouted. ""I am so thrilled. I am so proud of this team. Oh my gosh, this has been years of hard work.""

2024-01-18T21:52:23.000Z,Japan mission is latest effort to land on the Moon,BBC News,"Japan is set to make the latest attempt at a soft touch-down on the Moon.
Its Slim (Smart Lander for Investigating Moon) mission will aim for a gentle slope, close to an equatorial crater called Shioli.
The bid follows the failure this month of a private American company to reach the lunar surface.
Statistically, it's proven very hard to land on Earth's natural satellite safely. Only about a half of all attempts have succeeded.
Japan's space agency (Jaxa) hopes the precision navigation technologies built into Slim will stack the odds in its favour. Those technologies are behind the mission's nickname of ""Moon Sniper"".
The lander's onboard computer will be using rapid image processing and crater mapping to try to get to within 100m (330ft) of the targeted touch-down point.
Slim is set to begin the descent manoeuvres from an altitude of 15km (9 miles) at midnight into Saturday, Japan Standard Time (Friday 15:00 GMT).
If all goes well, the craft will nestle gently in the lunar ""soil"" 20 minutes later.
Only the government space agencies of the US, the Soviet Union, China and India have made it to the lunar surface intact. Jaxa has high confidence it will be number five.
There will be a web stream of the descent on the agency's YouTube channel.
Slim is not expected to work for long on the lunar surface, however.
Shioli is currently bathed in sunlight and when darkness returns at the end of the month, the spacecraft's solar panels won't be able to generate electricity and components will probably break in the plummeting temperatures.
But before then, Slim wants to use a scientific camera to study the rocks around the crater.
And with luck the mission's two small rovers will have had success traversing the local terrain.
One is a hopping robot that weighs about 2kg (4.4lb).
The other is a ball that will change its shape when it stops to take photos. One of the companies behind its development is Tomy, who created the Transformers toys.
Jaxa has twice landed on asteroids - an experience that should put Slim in good stead, although the much larger gravity at the Moon will make the feat a lot harder to achieve.
Last year, a private Japanese company, Ispace, had a go at landing. Its Hakuto-R craft crashed when the onboard computer became confused about its altitude above the Moon. It shut down its thruster system early, assuming the surface had been reached when in reality the mission still had another 5km (3 miles) to go.
On Thursday, the private American company Astrobotic disposed of its Peregrine landing craft in Earth's atmosphere. A propulsion fault prevented it from even trying to make a touch-down attempt.

2024-01-25T14:25:45.000Z,European mission approved to detect cosmic ripples,BBC News,"What will be one of the most ambitious and most expensive space missions ever mounted by Europe has just been given the formal green light.
The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (Lisa) will try to detect ripples in the fabric of space-time generated when gargantuan black holes collide.
These gravitational waves will be sensed by three spacecraft firing lasers at each other over a distance of 2.5 million km (1.5 million miles).
The cost will run into the billions.
Scientists believe that studying gravitational waves will help answer important questions about the workings and history of the Universe.
Officials at the European Space Agency (Esa) forecast a budget of €1.75bn (£1.5bn; $1.9bn), with additional contributions coming from member states including Germany, France, Italy, the UK, the Netherlands and Switzerland. The US space agency (Nasa) will be a major partner, too.
While this sum is considerable, it does represent a life-time cost - and the complexity of the mission means it will not launch before 2035 at the earliest.
Esa's director of science, Prof Carole Mundell, likened the cost to each European citizen to that of a cup of coffee, and she hoped they would agree with her that this represented great value for money.
""We're trying to solve some of the big mysteries of physics,"" she told BBC News.
""How do we go beyond Einstein's theory of general relativity (his theory of gravity)? How do we probe the nature of space-time? How do we understand the most violent collisions in the Universe, between supermassive black holes? So, you bring together what is almost science fiction and the science engineering, and we make it a science reality.""
Gravitational waves are a prediction of Einstein's equations.
They are the ripples of energy that spread across the cosmos at the speed of light when masses accelerate.
The waves were first detected in Earth laboratories in 2015. They were produced by the coming together of black holes that were a few times the mass of our Sun.
Going into space with detectors will allow researchers to sense much longer wavelength phenomena.
""It's all about size. With Lisa we're talking about sensing the coming together of black holes that are millions of times the mass of our Sun,"" said Prof Harry Ward from Glasgow University, UK.
Scientists are particularly keen to study these supermassive objects because their creation and evolution seems to be tied inextricably to that of the galaxies that host them, and probing their properties would therefore reveal details about how the great structures we see on the sky took shape through cosmic history.
On Earth, gravitational waves are detected from the perturbations they induce in the path of laser light as it is fired down 4km-long, L-shaped tunnels.
Lisa will use the same principle but fire its beams over a much greater distance, and between three identical spacecraft arranged as an equilateral triangle.
Astonishing measurement precision is needed because although the waves come from colossal sources, their signal is tiny - just fractions of the width of an atom.
Scientists talk about picometres, which are a trillionths of a metre.
""If you scale it up, it's the equivalent to measuring the change in distance to Alpha Centauri to about the thickness of a piece of paper,"" said Dr Ewan Fitzsimons at the UK Astronomy Technology Centre (UK ATC). Alpha Centauri encompasses the closest star system to Earth and is more than four light-years away.
Lisa has already been in development for decades, and has gone through various ups and downs, not least with the participation of the Americans. They've been in and out, but are now fully back on board, and will bring important technologies, including the lasers.
Esa's Science Programme Committee (SPC) selected Lisa as a candidate mission in 2017. Since then the agency's technical staff, with support from European industry and academia, have been studying whether the mission is actually feasible. A positive assessment has now allowed Esa delegations to formally ""adopt"" the project.
The UK Space Agency has given its support although this has the reservation that a business case still needs to be made to His Majesty's Treasury. This will be submitted shortly and a decision is expected before the end of the year, after which Esa will look to place the major industrial contracts across Europe.
Britain is set to provide what are called the optical benches in the spacecraft. These are the mirror systems that corral the laser light beams so their behaviour can be precisely monitored. One of the main data distribution centres will also be hosted in the UK.
Thursday's SPC meeting also adopted the Venus mission concept called Envision.

2024-02-15T22:49:41.000Z,Millions of donkeys killed each year to make medicine,BBC News,"To sell water and make his living, Steve relied completely on his donkeys. They pulled him in his cart loaded with its 20 jerry cans to all his customers. When Steve's donkeys were stolen for their skins, he could no longer work.
That day started like most others. In the morning, he left his home in the outskirts of Nairobi and went to the field to get his animals.
""I couldn't see them,"" he recalls. ""I searched all day, all night and the following day."" It was three days later that he got a call from a friend telling him he had found the animals' skeletons. ""They'd been killed, slaughtered, their skin was not there.""
Donkey thefts like this have become increasingly common across many parts of Africa - and in other parts of the world that have large populations of these working animals. Steve - and his donkeys - are collateral damage in a controversial global trade in donkey skin.
Its origins are thousands of miles from that field in Kenya. In China, a traditional medicinal remedy that is made with the gelatin in donkey skin is in high demand. It is called Ejiao.
It is believed to have health-enhancing and youth-preserving properties. Donkey skins are boiled down to extract the gelatin, which is made into powder, pills or liquid, or is added to food.
Campaigners against the trade say that people like Steve - and the donkeys they depend on - are victims of an unsustainable demand for Ejiao's traditional ingredient.
In a new report, the Donkey Sanctuary, which has campaigned against the trade since 2017, estimates that globally at least 5.9 million donkeys are slaughtered every year to supply it. And the charity says that demand is growing, although the BBC was unable to independently verify those figures.
It is very difficult to get an accurate picture of exactly how many donkeys are killed to supply the Ejiao industry.
In Africa, where about two-thirds of the world's 53 million donkeys live, there is a patchwork of regulations. Export of donkey skins is legal in some countries and illegal in others. But high demand and high prices for skins fuel the theft of donkeys, and the Donkey Sanctuary says it has discovered animals being moved across international borders to reach locations where the trade is legal.
However, there could soon be a turning point as every African state's government, and the government of Brazil, are poised to ban the slaughter and export of donkeys in response to their shrinking donkey populations.
Solomon Onyango, who works for the Donkey Sanctuary and is based in Nairobi, says: ""Between 2016 and 2019, we estimate that about half of Kenya's donkeys were slaughtered [to supply the skin trade].""
These are the same animals that carry people, goods, water and food - the backbone of poor, rural communities. So the scale and rapid growth of the skin trade has alarmed campaigners and experts, and has moved many people in Kenya to take part in anti-skin trade demonstrations.
The proposal for an Africa-wide, indefinite ban is on the agenda at the African Union Summit , where all state leaders meet, on 17 and 18 February.
Reflecting on a possible Africa-wide ban, Steve says he hopes it will help protect the animals, ""or the next generation will have no donkeys"".
But could bans across Africa and in Brazil simply shift the trade elsewhere?
Ejiao producers used to use skins from donkeys sourced in China. But, according to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs there, donkey numbers in the country plummeted from 11 million in 1990 to just under two million in 2021. At the same time, Ejiao went from being a niche luxury to become a popular, widely available product.
Chinese companies sought their skin supplies overseas. Donkey slaughterhouses were established in parts of Africa, South America and Asia.
In Africa, this led to a grim tug of war over the trade.
In Ethiopia, where the consumption of donkey meat is taboo, one of the country's two donkey slaughterhouses was closed down in 2017 in response to public protests and social media outcry.
Countries including Tanzania and Ivory Coast banned the slaughter and export of donkey skins in 2022, but China's neighbour Pakistan embraces the trade. Late last year, media reports there trumpeted the country's first ""official donkey breeding farm"" to raise ""some of the best breeds"".
And it is big business. According to China-Africa relations scholar Prof Lauren Johnston, from the University of Sydney, the Ejiao market in China increased in value from about $3.2bn (£2.5bn) in 2013 to about $7.8bn in 2020.
It has become a concern for public health officials, animal welfare campaigners and even international crime investigators. Research has revealed that shipments of donkey skins are used to traffic other illegal wildlife products. Many are worried that national bans on the trade will push it further underground.
For state leaders, there is the fundamental question: Are donkeys worth more to a developing economy dead or alive?
""Most of the people in my community are small-scale farmers and they use the donkeys to sell their goods,"" says Steve. He was saving money from selling water to pay for school fees to study medicine.
Faith Burden, who is head vet at the Donkey Sanctuary, says that the animals are ""absolutely intrinsic"" to rural life in many parts of the world. These are strong, adaptable animals. ""A donkey will be able to go for perhaps 24 hours without drinking and can rehydrate very quickly without any problems.""
But for all their qualities, donkeys do not breed easily or quickly. So campaigners fear that if the trade is not curtailed, donkey populations will continue to shrink, depriving more of the poorest people of a lifeline and a companion.
Mr Onyango explains: ""We never bred our donkeys for mass slaughter.""
Prof Johnston says that donkeys have ""carried the poor"" for millennia. ""They carry children, women. They carried Mary when she was pregnant with Jesus,"" she says.
Women and girls, she adds, bear the brunt of the loss when an animal is taken. ""Once the donkey is gone, then the women basically become the donkey again,"" she explains. And there is a bitter irony in that, because Ejiao is marketed primarily to wealthier Chinese women.
It is a remedy that is thousands of years old, believed to have numerous benefits from strengthening the blood to aiding sleep and boosting fertility. But it was a 2011 Chinese TV show called Empresses in the Palace - a fictional tale of an imperial court - that raised the remedy's profile.
""It was clever product placement,"" explains Prof Johnston. ""The women in the show consumed Ejiao every day to stay beautiful and healthy - for their skin and their fertility. It became this product of elite femininity. Ironically, that's now destroying many African women's lives.""
Steve, who is 24, is worried that, when he lost his donkeys, he lost control over his life and livelihood. ""I'm just stranded now,"" he says.
Working with a local animal welfare charity in Nairobi, the charity Brooke is working to find donkeys for young people -  like Steve -  who need them to access work and education.
Janneke Merkx, from the Donkey Sanctuary, says the more countries that put legislation in place to protect their donkeys, ""the more difficult it will get"".
""What we'd like to see is for Ejiao companies to stop importing donkey skins altogether and invest in sustainable alternatives - like cellular agriculture (producing collagen in labs). There are already safe and effective ways to do that.""
Faith Burden, the Donkey Sanctuary's deputy chief executive, calls the donkey skin trade ""unsustainable and inhumane"".
""They're being stolen, potentially walked hundreds of miles, held in a crowded pen and then slaughtered in full view of other donkeys,"" she says. ""They need us to speak up against this.""
Brooke has now given Steve a new donkey, a female that he has named Joy Lucky, because he feels lucky and joyful to have her.

2024-01-07T00:04:31.000Z,Earning the trust of a 40-stone silverback gorilla,BBC News,"When a wildlife cameraman was invited to film the gradual exposure of a gorilla family to humans, deep in the forests of the Democratic Republic of Congo, he got a little too close for comfort to the group's alpha male.
Suddenly, the giant silverback - known as Mpungwe - charged at him with a shriek.
But, despite being terrified, Vianet Djenguet knew the almost 40-stone (254kg) primate didn't want to hurt him. It was a test.
Anyone attempting to earn Mpungwe's trust and become a friend needed to show respect.
""That charge is a way of saying, 'Look I've got a family here, so back off',"" says Djenguet. ""But if you stand your ground, it stops him moving forward.""
The gorilla reached out and grabbed Djenguet's foot.
""I could feel the power of his hand,"" says the cameraman. ""I was quick enough to pull my foot back and then I completely froze.""
After he had charged, Mpungwe slid backwards down the hilly terrain and disappeared into the dense foliage.
Djenguet had been invited to meet Mpungwe by conservationists in DR Congo's Kahuzi-Biega National Park. They wanted him to document their attempts to get the silverback and his family used to the presence of humans.
The process - called habituation - can take between two and 10 years and involves tracking and following the animals through the 2,317 sq mile (6,000 sq km) forest.
It will only work if the group's alpha male, the silverback, is willing to accept the humans - if he does, his family will too.
Mpungwe and his family are among the last remaining eastern lowland gorillas in DR Congo, and the ultimate aim of habituation is to save them from extinction.
If successful, tourists will be able to visit the family, which will raise income to help protect the gorillas and their habitat.
This is the second attempt at habituating Mpungwe. A previous attempt in 2015 failed.
As an infant, Mpungwe was raised in a family of habituated gorillas, but he was then orphaned in 1996. The rest of his family were killed during a civil war - when the country was known as Zaire.
He roamed the forest, alone, says the park's chief guide, Papa Lambert Mongane. Over the course of time, he met other wild families and ""stole wild females"", says Mongane, until finally forming the family he has now.
But like any protective patriarch, Mpungwe, who is now 35 years old, will do anything to keep his group of 23 gorillas safe. His family includes male and female gorillas plus babies.
Vianet Djenguet was invited to film the habituation process for three months for a BBC documentary. He had to trek through dense forest each day, following the endangered gorillas with an eight stone (50kg) camera and tripod.
Gorillas, who share about 98% of their DNA with humans, are just like us, he says. They mentally ""photograph your face so they can remember exactly who you are"".
To show the gorillas he wanted to earn their trust, Djenguet says he had to act like them, mimicking their gestures and mannerisms - watching how they used their hands. When he beat his chest, the younger members of the group would beat theirs back.
""It just reminds me that we are so close to these creatures and they're doing incredible work for us,"" he says. ""They are the gardeners of those forests that release oxygen for us.""
The female gorillas care in a similar way to human mothers, adds Djenguet. He observed a baby gorilla having a tantrum, but says the mother made sure her child stayed relaxed in a manner that reminded him of humans.
A female gives birth to a baby gorilla every four to six years, says Djenguet. This low reproduction rate makes it harder for the gorillas to recover from population decline.
Consecutive wars, from 1996-2003, hit the country's gorilla population hard - explains the park's chief guide, Mongane. During this period of political instability, many of the gorilla population were killed and eaten for bushmeat.
And poacher's traps are still a deadly threat for the park's gorillas.
Mpungwe's son lost his foot when he got it caught in a trap, says Mongane, but the animal sensed what he needed to do to survive.
""He got up very early in the morning and plunged his feet into the river, leaving them in there for at least 10 minutes,"" says Mongane. ""In this way, he disinfected his wounds.""
Before the wars, there were 630 gorillas in the national park - he says - but there are now only believed to be 170, spread among 13 families.
Humans have also impacted the gorillas via deforestation - says Papa John Kahekwa, founder of Pole Pole Foundation, a community-led organisation working to protect the creatures.
The animals' habitat is being encroached upon by farmers growing crops, new villages being built or illegal logging. DR Congo lost 490,000 hectares (1.2m acres) of rainforest in 2020, according to Global Forest Watch.
As he followed Mpungwe's family, Djenguet says he felt like the presence of humans was causing the animals to feel stressed at some moments - shown by the diarrhoea-like droppings they produced.
He says if there was enough money for conservation, the gorillas would not have to be part of eco-tourism.
""It would be much easier to just leave them in the forest and let them be free,"" he says. ""You have to be cruel to be kind, and this is the pure example of it.""
Saving the eastern lowland gorilla is a difficult balancing act and, to succeed, it needs the support of the park's human neighbours who will also benefit from eco-tourism.
When local communities have income, says Kahekwa, they will prevent others in the village from harming the gorillas and their habitat. ""In that way, gorillas must pay for their own survival,"" he adds.
But there are other difficulties. In the mid-1980s to early 1990s, 7,000 tourists a year came to visit the national park, says Kahekwa. Since the wars, about 150 arrive each month. The security situation in much of eastern DR Congo, where most of the gorillas live, remains unstable.
Prior to Mpungwe's habituation, the park had only one group of habituated gorillas for tourists to visit, led by the silverback, Bonane. Mpungwe is now considered half-habituated, according to the eco-guards in the park. Although he has been visited by some tourists, his group is not as habituated as Bonane's.
As Djenguet's three months filming the gorillas came to an end, getting closer to the group every day, he says he felt Mpungwe and his family had ""almost adopted"" him, an experience he describes as humbling.
""They let me in,"" he says.
On his last day of filming, Mpungwe rose up and beat his chest to Djenguet, as if to say goodbye. If he ever returned, Djenguet believes Mpungwe will remember him.
Silverback will be broadcast on Sunday 7 January at 21:00 GMT on BBC Two. Or catch up afterwards on BBC iPlayer.

2024-01-22T10:43:31.000Z,Japan hopes sunlight can save stricken Slim Moon lander,BBC News,"Japan may yet manage to salvage its Moon lander, the country's space agency Jaxa says - if sunlight hits it in the right place.
The Slim spacecraft was turned off just three hours after its historic lunar touchdown on Saturday to save power.
Engineers had realised its solar cells were pointing west, away from the Sun, and could not generate electricity.
But the mission team is now hopeful the situation could improve as lighting conditions shift.
""If sunlight hits the Moon from the west in the future, we believe there's a possibility of power generation, and we're currently preparing for restoration,"" the Jaxa statement read.
The Slim mission - also nicknamed ""Moon Sniper"" for its use of precision-landing technologies - made Japan only the fifth nation in history to complete a soft lunar touchdown.
But the joy of seeing the craft complete its controlled descent soon turned to worry as power levels drained away.
Rather than let the battery system go completely flat, the decision was taken to put the craft to sleep.
""The battery was disconnected according to our procedures with 12% power remaining, in order to avoid a situation where the restart (of the lander) would be hampered,"" Jaxa said.
""As a result, the spacecraft was switched off at 02:57 (Saturday, Japan time, or 17:57 GMT, Friday).""
Before shutdown, mission control was able to successfully gather details of Slim's predicament, as well as images and data about its descent to the lunar surface.
""We're relieved and beginning to get excited after confirming a lot of data has been obtained,"" Jaxa said.
The agency promised updates through the week.
Moon missions try to land early in the ""lunar day"", when the Sun comes up over the eastern horizon. This gives a spacecraft about two ""Earth weeks"" of illumination before the Sun then sets in the west for two weeks of darkness.
It's currently ""morning"" at Slim's landing location on the slopes of Shioli Crater. If, as suspected, the spacecraft's solar cells are pointing westward, then it may have to wait until the ""lunar afternoon"" before those cells catch enough light to start charging the battery system.
Slim was carrying two small rovers, which data indicates it managed to eject as planned just before touchdown.
The craft is also equipped with an infrared camera to study the local geology. How much it could investigate if power levels are restored is uncertain.
Statistically, it's proven very hard to land on the Moon. Only about half of all attempts have succeeded.
Prior to Slim's touchdown only the US, the former Soviet Union, China and India had made it to the surface intact.
A private American mission gave up its landing bid earlier this month when it suffered a propulsion fault shortly after launch from Earth. Another commercial US mission will try its luck in late February.

2024-02-23T08:08:06.000Z,Moon landing: US firm Intuitive Machines makes historic touchdown,BBC News,"An American company has made history by becoming the first commercial outfit to put a spacecraft on the Moon.
Houston-based Intuitive Machines landed its Odysseus robot near the lunar south pole.
It took some minutes for controllers to establish that the craft was down, but eventually a signal was received.
""What we can confirm, without a doubt, is our equipment is on the surface of the Moon and we are transmitting,"" flight director Tim Crain announced.
Staff at the company cheered and clapped at the news.
It was an important moment, not just for the commercial exploitation of space but for the US space programme in general.
Intuitive Machines has broken the United States' half-century absence from the Moon's surface. You have to go back to the last Apollo mission in 1972 for an occasion when American hardware nestled down gently in the lunar soil.
The US space agency Nasa had purchased room on Odysseus for six scientific instruments, and its administrator Bill Nelson was quick to add his congratulations to Intuitive Machines for a mission he described as a ""triumph"".
""The US has returned to the Moon,"" he said. ""Today, for the first time in the history of humanity, a commercial company - an American company - launched and led the voyage up there. And today is the day that shows the power and promise of Nasa's commercial partnerships.""
Controllers had to deal with an almost mission-stopping technical problem even before the descent began.
Odysseus' ranging lasers, which were supposed to calculate the craft's altitude and velocity, weren't working properly.
Fortunately, there were some experimental lasers from Nasa on board, and engineers were able to patch these across to the navigation computers.
Odysseus touched down at 23:23 GMT. At first, there was no signal at all from the robot. There were plenty of nerves as the minutes ticked by, but eventually a communications link was made, albeit a faint one.
This led to some concerns about the status of the lander. Within a couple of hours, however, Intuitive Machines was reporting that Odysseus was standing upright and sending back data, including pictures.
The targeted landing site was a cratered terrain next to a 5km-high mountain complex known as Malapert. It's the southernmost point on the Moon ever visited by a spacecraft, at 80 degrees South.
It's on the shortlist of locations where Nasa is considering sending astronauts later this decade as part of its Artemis programme.
There are some deep craters in this region that never see any sunlight - they're permanently in shadow - and scientists think frozen water could be inside them.

""The ice is really important because if we can actually take advantage of that ice on the surface of the Moon, that's less materials we have to bring with us,"" explained Lori Glaze, Nasa's director of planetary science.
""We could use that ice to convert it to water - drinkable drinking water - and we can extract oxygen and hydrogen for fuel and for breathing for the astronauts. So it really helps us in human exploration.""
Nasa's six payloads on board Odysseus are a mix of technology demonstration and science.
A key investigation will be one looking at the behaviour of lunar dust, which the Apollo astronauts found to be a serious nuisance, scratching and clogging their equipment.
The agency's scientists want to understand better how the dust is kicked up by landing craft to hang just above the surface before then settling back down.
The six commercial payloads on board include a student camera system from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, which should have been deployed from Odysseus when it was still 30m above the lunar surface.
This system was designed to take selfie images as the robot set itself down.
American artist Jeff Koons has also attached a box to the side of the lander that contains 125 small stainless steel balls to represent the Moon's different phases through a month.
Prior to Intuitive Machines' success, only government space agencies had put spacecraft down softly on the Moon - the US, the Soviet Union, China, India and Japan.
In January, another American company, Astrobotic, had a go. Its Peregrine lander developed technical problems en route to the Moon and gave up the opportunity of a touchdown. The robot was brought back to burn up in Earth's atmosphere.

2024-02-22T02:29:09.000Z,Whale song mystery solved by scientists,BBC News,"Scientists have worked out how some of the largest whales in the ocean produce their haunting and complex songs.
Humpbacks and other baleen whales have evolved a specialised ""voice box"" that enables them to sing underwater.
The discovery, published in the journal Nature, has also revealed why the noise we make in the ocean is so disruptive for these ocean giants.
Whale song is restricted to a narrow frequency that overlaps with the noise produced by ships.
""Sound is absolutely crucial for their survival, because it's the only way they can find each other to mate in the ocean,"" explained Prof Coen Elemans, of the University of Southern Denmark, who led the study.
""[These are some] of the most enigmatic animals that ever lived on the planet,"" he told BBC News. ""They are amongst the biggest animals, they're smart and they're highly social.""
Baleen whales are a group of 14 species, including the blue, humpback, right, minke and gray whale. Instead of teeth, the animals have plates of what is called baleen, through which they sieve huge mouthfuls of tiny creatures from the water.
Exactly how they produce complex, often haunting songs has been a mystery until now. Prof Elemans said it was ""super-exciting"" to have figured it out.
He and his colleagues carried out experiments using larynxes, or ""voice boxes"", that had been carefully removed from three carcasses of stranded whales - a minke, a humpback and a sei whale. They then blew air through the massive structures to produce the sound.
In humans, our voices come from vibrations when air passes over structures called vocal folds in our throat. Baleen whales, instead, have a large U-shaped structure with a cushion of fat at the top of the larynx.
This vocal anatomy allows the animals to sing by recycling air, and it prevents water from being inhaled.
The researchers produced computer models of the sounds and showed that baleen whale song is restricted to a narrow frequency which overlaps with noise produced by shipping vessels.
""They cannot simply choose to, for example, sing higher to avoid the noise we make in the ocean,"" explained Prof Elemans.
His study demonstrated how our ocean noise could prevent whales from communicating over long distances. That knowledge could be vital for the conservation of humpbacks, blue whales and other endangered giants of the sea.
It also provides insight into questions that researchers have been asking for decades about these eerie songs, which some sailors used to attribute to ghosts or mythical sea creatures.
Whale communication expert Dr Kate Stafford, from Oregon State University, called the study ""groundbreaking"".
""The production and reception of sound is the most important sense for marine mammals, so any studies that elucidate how they make sounds has the potential to move the field forward,"" she told BBC News.
The research also paints an evolutionary picture - of how the ancestors of whales returned to the oceans from the land, and the adaptations that made it possible to communicate underwater.
The way so-called toothed whales produce sound is better understood, because the animals are easier to study. These marine mammals, which include dolphins, orcas, sperm whales and porpoises, blow air through a special structure in their nasal passages.
Dr Ellen Garland, from the Sea Mammal Research Unit at the University of St Andrews, said: ""I've always wondered exactly how baleen whales - especially humpbacks, which my research is focused on - actually produce the variety of sounds they do.
""Studying large whales is extremely challenging at the best of times, but trying to uncover how they produce sound when you may not even be able to see them underwater while vocalising is an added level of difficulty, so these researchers have been very creative.""
Dr Stafford added that the mammals' ability to make such complex vocal signals was ""remarkable"" and highlighted ""how special these animals are"".

2024-01-23T10:48:38.000Z,North Sea oil and gas claims fact-checked,BBC News,"The government has been defending a plan that could see new licences granted every year for fossil fuel drilling in the North Sea.
In a debate in the House of Commons, it claimed it would be cleaner than importing oil and gas from overseas and would help the UK's energy security. Critics say it would damage the UK's reputation on climate action.
We've examined some of the claims.
Energy Secretary Claire Coutinho told MPs: ""Gas that we bring in from abroad through LNG has four times higher emissions.""
Liquified natural gas (LNG) is gas that is compressed into liquid form and shipped in, rather than pumped through pipelines.
She is right to say emissions from UK gas production are indeed roughly four times lower than imported LNG, according to figures cited by the North Sea Transition Authority, the UK's oil and gas regulator.
But most of the UK's gas imports are typically not LNG, rather they are pumped in via pipelines from Norway, according to government data.
And Norway's gas is on average much cleaner than the UK's.
These figures only relate to what's known as the ""production phase"" - just the greenhouse gases emitted from getting oil and gas out of the ground.
Total emissions from oil and gas come mainly from using these fossil fuels.
Claire Coutinho also told MPs: ""Our bill will improve our energy security.""
While the UK is heavily reliant on oil and gas imports, there's no guarantee that extra domestic production would stay in the UK, especially when it comes to oil.
This is because it is extracted by private companies, who sell it on the open international market, rather than necessarily to the UK.
For this reason - and because some oil can't be refined in the UK - around 80% of the oil produced in the North Sea is actually exported.
Most of UK North Sea gas is pumped directly into the UK network, but some is then exported to Europe, for example to be stored for winter, according to Dr Simon Cran-McGreehin, head of analysis at the ECIU, an independent energy and climate think tank.
Amanda Solloway, a minister in the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, confirmed in December that there were no plans to force private companies to allocate oil and gas in the North Sea for domestic use.
Shadow climate change secretary Ed Miliband said: ""the legislation we are considering today won't cut bills"".
He is right. Oil and gas prices in the UK are determined by global energy prices.
""No amount of UK North Sea oil and gas will turn the dial on international prices, because our volumes are so small, and because everything is run through markets,"" Dr Cran-McGreehin says.
Defending the plan on BBC Breakfast on 6 November 2023, Claire Coutinho admitted: ""It wouldn't necessarily bring energy bills down"".
But she claimed it would raise a significant amount of money in tax revenue to help fund public services.
The government's independent climate advisers, the Climate Change Committee (CCC), argue that the best way to reduce the reliance on imports and lower bills is to boost renewables and other low carbon technologies to reduce the demand for fossil fuels in the first place.
Over the past decade, the government has made progress in boosting UK's renewable electricity generation - from 7% of the total in 2010 to over 40% last year.
Claire Coutinho also said: ""Even the Climate Change Committee's own data shows that when we reach net zero in 2050, we'll still be using oil and gas.""
It is true that the UK will still use some oil (mainly for aviation) and gas (mainly for electricity and fuel supply) in 2050, as the chart below from the CCC confirms.
This is the date by which the UK has pledged to reach net zero - the point where the UK no longer adds to the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, by removing as much as it emits.
But UK demand for oil and gas needs to fall 80% by 2050 for the UK to meet its targets, the CCC says.
In particular, it says there will be much less need for oil - which makes up most of the remaining North Sea reserves - as cars, trains and buses switch away from petrol and diesel.
For this reason, the CCC has distanced itself from the idea that it backs new UK oil and gas.
Prof Piers Forster, the interim chair of the CCC, tweeted in response to the proposed legislation that further oil and gas licensing was ""inconsistent with climate goals"".
This is because countries agreed to transition away from fossil fuels at the last year's COP28 climate summit. Some fossil fuels need to be kept in the ground to have a chance of limiting warming to globally agreed levels, says Rebecca Willis, a professor of energy and climate governance at Lancaster University.
The International Energy Agency has previously said there is no need for investment in new oil and gas projects to meet global energy demand.

2024-02-26T15:01:50.000Z,Japan Moon lander survives lunar night,BBC News,"Japan's Moon lander has survived the harsh lunar night, the sunless and freezing equivalent to two Earth weeks.
""Last night, a command was sent to #SLIM and a response received,"" national space agency Jaxa said on X.
The craft was put into sleep mode after an awkward landing in January left its solar panels facing the wrong way and unable to generate power.
A change in sunlight direction later allowed it to send pictures back but it shut down again as lunar night fell.
Jaxa said at the time that Slim (Smart Lander for Investigating Moon) was not designed for the harsh lunar nights.
It said it planned to try to operate again from mid-February, when the Sun would shine again on Slim's solar cells.
""The news that Slim has rebooted itself after the cold lunar night is significant,"" said Dr Simeon Barber from the UK's Open University. ""Surviving lunar night is one of the key technological challenges to be overcome if we are to establish long-lived robotic or human missions on the Moon.""
Dr Barber explained that Slim landed near the Moon's equator, where the lunar surface reaches more than 100C at noon, but then plunges to -130C during the lunar night.
Jaxa said that communication with the lander was terminated after a short time - it was lunar midday, meaning the temperature of the communications equipment was very high.
But it posted the following picture on X, which it said was taken from the lander while it was back in action.
Jaxa said preparations were being made to resume operations when instrument temperatures had cooled sufficiently.
During its previous brief period of re-awakening, Slim was able to study its surroundings in detail and transmit new images to Earth.
Jaxa will be hoping that having survived the lunar night it will be able to continue its work.

Dr Barber said that future landers would need so-called ""active thermal control"" - that is the ability to dissipate heat generated on board during the daytime, and then to change into a heat-conserving mode at night to prevent things getting too cold.
""The fact that Slim survived without such a complex design might give us clues as to how electronics really behave on the Moon,"" he said. ""Plus, we can look forward to more science from Slim!""
The landing in January made Jaxa only the fifth national space agency to achieve a soft touchdown on the Moon - after the US, the former Soviet Union, China and India.
Also in a post on X, Jaxa congratulated the team behind a US spacecraft, the Odysseus Moon lander, for making history on Thursday by becoming the first ever privately built and operated robot to complete a soft lunar touchdown.
Like Slim, it also landed awkwardly. Controllers at the operating company, Intuitive Machines, think their robot tipped on to its side at the moment of touchdown. Odysseus does, however, appear still to be functional and is communicating with Earth.
No pictures from the Odysseus mission at the surface have yet been released.

Keeping long-term temperature increases below this level is seen as crucial if the most damaging impacts of climate change are to be avoided.
In 2015, world leaders pledged to try and prevent global temperatures rising by more than 1.5C.
It saw almost all the world's nations - for the first time - agree to cut the greenhouse gas emissions which cause global warming.
Adopted by 194 parties (193 countries plus the EU) in the French capital on 12 December 2015, the Paris Agreement came into force on 4 November 2016.
The agreement lists a series of commitments:
The 1.5C target is generally accepted to mean a 20 year average, rather than a single year.
Scientists say that every 0.1C of temperature increase brings with it greater risks for the planet - longer heatwaves, more intense storms and wildfires.
The 1.5C target was agreed because there is very strong evidence that the impacts would become much more extreme as the world gets closer to 2C. Some changes could become irreversible.
The science is not completely certain, but the consequences of 2C global warming versus 1.5C could be:
World leaders meet every year to discuss their climate commitments, at international summits known as COPs (Conference of the Parties).
All COPs since 2015 have tracked how countries are building on what they promised in Paris.
When the agreement was signed, governments admitted the Paris targets would not limit global warming to 1.5C.
Current pledges and targets still put the world on track for around 2.1C of warming by 2100, according to the independent Climate Action Tracker.
The UK has a legally binding commitment to reduce emissions by 68% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. But in September 2023, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced delays to several green policies, such as delaying the phase-out of new petrol and diesel cars.
The UK government's independent climate advisers warned that the announcements were ""likely to take the UK further away from being able to meet its legal commitments"".
At the most recent COP28 in December 2023, for the first time countries agreed to ""contribute"" to ""transitioning away from fossil fuels"", although they are not forced to take action.
Analysis for COP28 by the UN made clear that further ""deep, rapid and sustained reductions"" in greenhouse gas emissions were needed to prevent the permanent breach of 1.5C.
The Paris deal restated a commitment first made in 2009 that the world's richer countries should provide $100bn (£79bn) annually by 2020 to help developing nations deal with the effects of climate change, and build greener economies.
In 2020 only $83.3bn was raised, but the OECD said it thinks the 2022 figures will show the goal ""is likely to have been met"".
For decades developing countries have also been demanding payments for ""loss and damage"". This is compensation to cover the effects of climate change which they are already experiencing.
Little progress was made until COP28, where delegates agreed to launch the fund. The EU, UK, US and others announced contributions totalling around $700m (£556m).

If the spacecraft Odysseus's mission is successful, its owner Intuitive Machines will make history as the first private company to land on the Moon.
All previous landings have been carried out by national space agencies.
The robotic craft will attempt to land on the lunar surface's south pole, where scientists hope there could be a source of water.
It is the second commercial mission to be funded by the US space agency Nasa, as it seeks to encourage private missions to the Moon as a way to expand its reach in space.
The craft launched at 01:05 EST (06:05GMT) on top of a Falcon 9 rocket made by Elon Musk's SpaceX company.
Minutes later, the first stage of the rocket was released as planned and returned to Earth.
It was the third attempt, after bad weather prevented a launch in January and another was called off on Wednesday due to irregular methane temperatures.
There is still a long way to go before the mission can be called a success.
""We have to be humble about it,"" a representative for Intuitive Machines said on Thursday minutes before the launch.
""We looked at every mission that's gone to the Moon to learn from those mistakes,"" he added.
The lander uses a combination of liquid methane and oxygen for fuel, which had to be loaded into the craft before lift-off.
It is carrying a range of scientific instruments for Nasa, which is paying Intuitive Machines $118m (£93m). One tool will measure how the landing disturbs and sends up plumes of moon dust.
Another is a laser retroreflector array which will bounce back laser beams fired from Earth.
And a camera will be thrown off the craft before landing to take pictures of the machine as it touches down on the Moon.

It is also carrying commercial payloads, including 125 tiny sculptures made by US artist Jeff Koons. He hopes they will be the first authorised artworks to make it to the lunar surface.
The lander is about the size of an old British phone box, according to Intuitive Machines. It is a hexagonal cylinder with six legs for landing.
Its journey to the Moon should take about a week. It aims to land about 186 miles from the south pole on the Moon's near side.
It would be the first time an American spacecraft has landed in that area, which is of interest to scientists because it could be home to frozen water.
Intuitive Machines hopes to send another spacecraft in March that would drill to find underground ice.
This is the second mission funded by Nasa's initiative to encourage private missions to space. The first was Astrobotic's Peregrine Lander which failed after a fuel leak in January.
""We're trying to create a marketplace in a place where it didn't exist,"" Nasa official Joel Kearns said on Tuesday. ""But to do that, we have to do it in a cost-conscious manner.""
Two other private companies have also tried to reach the Moon. Israeli company SpaceIL's Beresheet craft and ispace of Japan's Hakuto-R both crash-landed and were destroyed.

Heavy rain forces run-off into streams and rivers. Campaigners say it causes ""absolutely horrific"" damage in places, including just downstream of where The Great British Bake Off is filmed.
England's major road network has more than 18,000 outflows or drains.
National Highways runs the network and says it's working to improve them.
Responsibility for monitoring water pollution in England rests with the Environment Agency.
In response to a BBC News freedom of information request, it said that the agency did not regularly monitor run-off, though it did test for pollutants from roads as part of its general water monitoring.
The EA said it recognised that run-off from highways and urban areas was a ""serious issue"" accounting for 18% of water quality failures in England, and the third most damaging source of water pollution after agriculture and sewage.
Campaigners have been doing their own testing and told the BBC they had found micro-plastics, heavy metals, toxic chemicals like arsenic and carcinogenic compounds from car tyres.
Prof Alex Ford, an expert on the impact of water pollution on aquatic organisms at the University of Portsmouth, said that some of the contaminants are known to damage DNA, impact the nervous system and cause cancer.
""We don't fully understand the impact these contaminants have as a cocktail but we know they can be toxic to aquatic life and potentially contribute to the poor ecological status of some rivers,"" he said.
The Environment Agency can issue permits for activities that have the potential to cause pollution. They set out the limits to the pollution and can set rules the polluter must follow to keep environmental harm to a minimum.
Sewage outfalls have permits and MPs have in the past urged the EA to put permits on outfalls. But the EA has chosen not to saying it ""would not result in reduced pollution"". It did say that it was looking at ""possible benefits of using permits for some of the most polluting outfalls"".
""We are working to reduce all sources of pollution damaging the environment, whether they are from our roads, or water and farming industries,"" an Environment Agency spokesperson told the BBC.
At the River Lambourn in Berkshire the environmental impact of run-off can be seen very clearly.
A chalk stream, the Lambourn's crystal clear water winds through Welford Park, home of The Great British Bake Off's white tent,  before passing underneath the M4 motorway.
At that point it turns brown and murky. Chalk streams are supposed to have clean gravel beds.
""Look at this black gunk,"" Charlotte Hitchmough, the director of Action for the River Kennet (of which the Lambourn is a tributary) says as she scrapes a net along the bottom. In the past she has sent samples of the ""gunk"" away to be tested.
""There's some really scary pollutants in there. Things like arsenic, lots of heavy metals, lots of things from oil, microplastics from tyres, we can be sure that the road is having a really negative effect on the ecology of this river.""
National Highways has a statutory responsibility to make sure that discharges from its network do not cause pollution. It said this outfall had been assessed as ""low risk"" and was not in line for any mitigation measures.
Just by the M6 services at Chorley we visit an outfall that National Highways cannot find a record of on their database.
""It literally keeps me awake at night,""says Jo Bradley, a former Environment Agency employee who has now dedicated herself to raising awareness of road run-off.
""This little stream should be beautiful,"" Jo says as we look at what the map says is Syd Brook, at this point a murky pool of water topped with foam. ""It's absolutely horrific.""
When it rains, water from the M6 motorway drains directly into the stream. Jo shows me a plastic bottle full of brownish black water that she gathered during heavy rain the day before.
Her organisation Stormwater Shepherds has found tyre particles and dust from clutch and brake pads in the water.
""Because of the toxicity and the poisons in the sediment I would put this on a par with sewage (pollution) and to be frank, I'd probably put it above sewage,"" she says.
""Because they're not being monitored, no-one even knows the extent of the pollution and then nobody's doing anything about it. Nobody wants to talk about this.""
National Highways is aware it has a problem and has been using a computer model to choose which outfalls to tackle. It has identified 1,236 locations that are ""potentially high risk"" and is expecting after verification that about 250 will actually be ""high risk"" and need some form of mitigation.
Under its current plans only about 30 of those high-risk sites will have mitigation in place by the end of 2025. A committee of MPs last year called that ""unacceptably slow progress"".
""We do take this incredibly seriously - we think it's important and we think there's more for us to do,"" Stephen Elderkin, National Highways director of Environmental Sustainability told BBC News.
""And so what we have set in place is a plan to identify those outfalls that present an elevated risk, to design mitigations that need to be put in place and then to deliver them before 2030.""
One of those mitigations is just off the A38 in Devon. At a cost of about £2.5m National Highways in 2019 built a reed bed that filters run-off from the busy road.
""This is a good news story,"" says Rob Ballard, senior ranger at Stover Country Park. He's holding a picture that shows how the lake used to look, with much of it covered with water lilies.
""It was almost like a Monet painting,"" he says.
The water lilies aren't fully back yet but Rob says they've seen the return of a whole raft of species which suggest the health of the lake is improving.
""We've got damselflies and dragonflies, little water boatmen, whirligig beetles, water scorpions and because of all of them, we get all the birds that feed off them,"" he says.
The next step is to dredge the lake of all the heavily polluted silt that remains at the bottom.

2024-02-28T19:23:24.000Z,Intuitive Machines: Moon lander pictured on its side with snapped leg,BBC News,"The first clear images of the Odysseus robot on the surface of the Moon have just been released.
They include a view of the American mission lying to one side, having broken a leg on touchdown.
The spacecraft continued to work afterwards, however, sending back data about the lunar environment.
Odysseus made history last Thursday by becoming the first ever privately built vehicle to complete a soft landing on the Moon.
And despite the awkward orientation it eventually adopted, the robot should be celebrated, said US space agency administrator Bill Nelson.
Nasa had contracted the operating company, Houston-based Intuitive Machines, to carry six scientific instruments on board the lander.
""Odysseus is a success,"" the agency chief told reporters. ""We are in the sixth day of what was planned as an eight-day mission, and we're still receiving data from those instruments.""
Odysseus' descent, clearly, was a little hairy.
The robot was supposed to come straight down, vertically, with a speed of one metre per second.
In the event, it had navigation issues whereby the onboard computer couldn't process precise laser range-finding data fast enough and had to rely solely on optical cameras for altitude and velocity information.
It meant the craft actually came in three times faster than it should have, and with an element of sideways movement that resulted in a skid.
""The landing gear took the bulk of the load and we broke one or two possibly landing gear,"" explained Steve Altemus, IM's CEO and co-founder.
""We sat there upright with the engine firing for a period of time. And then, as it wound down, the vehicle just gently tipped over, and in our simulation with 1/6 gravity, we showed that it took about two seconds.""
Odysseus is thought to be resting on one of its yellow helium pressure tanks at an angle to the surface of roughly 30 degrees.
The craft was forced to communicate with Houston via its low-gain antennas. But once controllers got the hang of how the signals were being sent, a broad data stream was established.
Nasa's six instruments were focused on testing new navigation technologies and studying the surface conditions at the landing site.
Susan Lederer, who oversaw all the experiments, said the agency teams and IM staff worked side by side to make the mission a success.
""We were collaboratively working together to find solutions so that the spacecraft could live and the payloads could get their data,"" she told reporters.
""We went from basically a cocktail straw of data coming back to a boba tea-sized (very large) straw of data coming back.""
The robot is expected to go into hibernation on Thursday at the latest.
Because of the way its solar cells are pointing, they're going to lose sight of the Sun and that will deny the battery of charge.
And, in any case, the Sun will soon disappear over the horizon. Only when it returns in mid-March will engineers have a chance of reviving Odysseus.
""We'll start listening at sunrise at our location and see if 'Odie' wakes up from a nap,"" said Tim Crain, IM's CTO and co-founder.
Susan Lederer said she wouldn't bet against the ""scrappy little dude"" re-establishing contact.
The Intuitive Machines mission is part of Nasa's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) programme, in which the agency is paying various private American companies for cargo services to the Moon.
These companies are responsible for designing, building and operating their robot landers - Nasa is a payload customer.
A whole series of robotic ""scouts"" is planned as the agency works towards returning astronauts to the Moon's surface later this decade.
Nasa regards the CLPS approach as a more economical way of getting its science done, while at the same time seeding what it hopes will become a thriving lunar economy.
Intuitive Machines has two further missions in prospect for 2024. The next will see a robot drill into the surface.
""We've kicked open the door for a robust thriving cislunar economy in the future. That's compelling,"" said Steve Altemus.
""I think this CLPS experiment, this first landing, the success on the Moon for first time (by the US) in 52 years, is really a point in history that we should celebrate.""
Earlier this week, the Japanese space agency managed to wake its Slim lander after it had gone through a ""lunar night"".
The Jaxa robot had also touched down in an awkward fashion - on its nose. But like Odysseus, this didn't stop it functioning, and it was able to send back many pictures of its surroundings.

2024-03-07T12:34:50.000Z,"World's earliest fossilised forest discovered in Minehead, Somerset",BBC News,"Scientists have found what they believe to be the world's earliest known fossilised forest in cliffs on the coast of South West England.
It was discovered in high sandstone cliffs near Minehead, Somerset, close to a Butlin's holiday camp.
Researchers from Cambridge and Cardiff Universities say they are the oldest fossilised trees ever found in Britain and the oldest known forest on Earth.
The trees, known as calamophyton, resemble palm trees.
Described as a kind of 'prototype' of today's trees, the largest were between two and four metres tall.
The researchers identified the fossils of plants and their debris as well as fossilised tree logs and traces of roots.
They show how early trees helped shape landscapes and stabilised riverbanks and coastlines hundreds of millions of years ago.
""When I first saw pictures of the tree trunks I immediately knew what they were, based on 30 years of studying this type of tree worldwide,"" said co-author Dr Christopher Berry from Cardiff's School of Earth and Environmental Sciences.
""It was amazing to see them so near to home. But the most revealing insight comes from seeing, for the first time, these trees in the positions where they grew.""
Dr Paul Kenrick, an expert on plant fossils at the Natural History Museum, who was not involved in the study, said that these clues as to how plants grew together at the time were deeply significant.
The researchers say the fossil forest is about four million years older than the previous record holder in New York State.
It was found in the Hangman Sandstone Formation along the Devon and Somerset coasts and dates back to the Devonian Period, between 419 and 358 million years ago, the time of life's big expansion onto land. The period is named after Devon because of marine rocks emblematic of the period, which geologists found off the coast.
The researchers say that the area of the find was at the time a semi-arid plain, attached not to England, but to parts of Germany and Belgium, where fossils of such trees have also been found.
""This was a pretty weird forest - not like any forest you would see today,"" said Prof Neil Davies from Cambridge's Department of Earth Sciences, the study's first author.
""There wasn't any undergrowth to speak of and grass hadn't yet appeared, but there were lots of twigs dropped by these densely-packed trees, which had a big effect on the landscape.""
Dr Kenrick, from the Natural History Museum said that the trees were very different from any we know today. The most similar modern counterpart might be Dicksonia antarctica, a type of tree fern native to Australasia, but popular in Britain as an ornamental plant.

2024-03-13T01:33:45.000Z,Giant redwoods: World’s largest trees 'thriving in UK',BBC News,"Giant redwoods - the world's largest trees - are flourishing in the UK and now even outnumber those found in their native range in California.
The giants were first brought to the UK about 160 years ago, and a new study suggests they are growing at a similar rate to their US counterparts.
An estimated 500,000 trees are in the UK compared to 80,000 in California.
However they aren't yet as tall. In California they can reach 90m-high, but in the UK the tallest is 54.87m.
But that's because the introduced trees are still very young. Giant redwoods can live for more than 2,000 years, so there's still plenty of time for the UK's trees to catch up
""Half a million trees is quite a lot to go under the radar until now, but it's when you start looking for them in the landscape, and compiling these datasets, that you realise how many there are,"" said Dr Phil Wilkes, one of the authors of the study, from Kew's botanic garden at Wakehurst in Sussex.
Giant redwoods (Sequoiadendron giganteum) were first brought to the UK by the Victorians.  They were the ultimate botanical status symbol, typically planted in the grand estates of the wealthy.
Today, some form sweeping avenues while others stand in ones or twos. But they're easy to spot: their dense, cone-shaped crowns stand proud of everything around them.
To assess how these towering giants are adapting to their UK home, scientists selected a sample of nearly 5,000 trees to study at Wakehurst, Benmore Botanic Garden in Argyllshire, Scotland and Havering Country Park in Essex.
They used laser scanners to measure the heights and volumes of some of the trees - it's also a way to weigh the trees without cutting them down.
The researchers found that the trees were growing about as fast as the giant redwoods in their native home in the mountains of Sierra Nevada. The UK climate seems to suit them, says Dr Wilkes.
""Where they grow in California, it's cooler and moister than you would typically envisage California to be,"" he explained.
""And we have a reasonably similar climate here - it's very wet and they need the moisture to grow.""
The scientists also looked at how much carbon dioxide the trees were absorbing - trees soak up and store the greenhouse gas and planting more trees can play a role in helping to tackle climate change.
The researchers found that because of their sheer size, giant redwoods can lock up large amounts of carbon dioxide in their wood - although not as much as their US counterparts.
The trees at Wakehurst, which are about 45m tall, have about 10 to 15 tonnes of carbon stored in them, Dr Wilkes explained.
""But compare this to the largest tree in California, which has about 250 tonnes of carbon stored in it, and they're quite small. But you know, these could get as big.""
The scientists involved in the research are quick to point out that planting forests of giant redwoods would not be enough to significantly reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. But these majestic giants can play a part in a mixed forest plantation with a variety of other trees, both native and imported.
In California, the natural wonders are under threat from climate change - they're not faring well with hotter and drier weather and more intense wildfires.
So could the UK become their new home?
In an avenue of trees originally planted as a grand entrance to a now demolished mansion in Havering Country Park,  Prof Mat Disney, from University College London, says he thinks it's more than possible.
""In terms of climate, it's probably the case that they're going to have a less pressured existence here than they do in California,"" he said.
Although he pointed out that conditions are also changing in the UK with climate change.
Giant redwoods are being planted as saplings all over the country, often by local authorities in public parks or recreation grounds.
Prof Disney says they have a long life ahead of them - and they won't stay small for long.
""They're very fast growing, and they grow large. Once they reach about 60m, they will be the tallest trees in Britain, and then they will keep on growing,"" he said.
However, while the trees are doing well in the UK, there's little chance of them taking over our native forests any time soon - they're not reproducing here as they need very specific conditions to take seed.
The study is published in the Royal Society journal Open Science.

2024-03-04T16:42:52.000Z,"Bee-harming neonicotinoid use ""makes a mockery"" of ban",BBC News,"Sugar beet farmers have the green light to use a banned pesticide deadly to bees following a forecast that a virus could sweep through their crops.
Emergency authorisation to use neonicotinoids was given in January but rested on a threat level being met.
Supplier British Sugar said the predicted infection rate was now 83% of crop and was ""historically high"".
Defra said the decision to approve was not ""taken lightly"" but campaigners said it made ""a mockery"" of the ban.
Neonicotinoids are toxic to pollinating bees, disrupting their ability to navigate and reproduce. But some sugar beet farmers say the pesticides are needed to protect against the disease known as virus yellows.
The threat level posed by the virus had to be independently scientifically-verified by Rothamsted Research in its virus yellows forecast model as being above 65% of crop potentially affected before final permission for the pesticide to be used could be given.
Chair of the NFU's sugar board Michael Sly, who farms land in north Cambridgeshire and south Lincolnshire, said the sugar beet sector - which supports more than 9,500 jobs - was ""facing a significant threat"" from the disease, which is spread by aphids, and ""can decimate crops"".
Dan Green, agriculture director for British Sugar - which supplies 60% of the UK's sugar - added that the pesticide was needed ""to protect the UK sugar beet crop and farmer livelihoods"".
""This year's forecast for virus yellows infection is historically high and exceeds the threshold of 65% to use the seed treatment, as set by Defra in January,"" he told the BBC.
Previous years have seen the predicted threat range from 8% in 2021 to 85% in 2020, a season when the virus was estimated to have eventually cost growers £43m.
But environmentalists and wildlife campaigners have warned that the decision will be devastating to bees and pointed out that the government had now approved neonicotinoid use for four consecutive years.
Richard Benwell, the CEO of Wildlife and Countryside Link, said: ""To have four emergency authorisations in a row makes a mockery of the ban, and now the trigger has been reached, nature will once again have to endure exposure to this harmful chemical.""
He called on the government to urgently deliver its long-awaited strategy on sustainable pesticide use.
Barnaby Coupe, land use policy manager at The Wildlife Trusts, said the organisation was ""hugely disappointed"" but called for farmers to be given more support to grow sugar beet without resorting to chemicals.
A Defra spokesperson said the pesticide would be ""tightly controlled"", adding: ""This decision has not been taken lightly, and now the threshold for the product's use has been passed it will be strictly limited to mitigate risks to the environment, including potential risks to pollinators.""
Restrictions include limits on what crops can be planted in the same field as treated sugar beet and on the further use of thiamethoxam seed treatments on the same field within 46 months.
Levels of neonicotinoids in the environment will be monitored.
The government said its national action plan on the sustainable use of pesticides is due to be published ""shortly"".

The creature dates back 240 million years and has been dubbed a ""dragon"" because of its extremely long neck.
It is called Dinocephalosaurus orientalis, a species that was originally identified back in 2003.
This spectacular new fossil has allowed scientists to see the full anatomy of this bizarre prehistoric beast.
Dr Nick Fraser, from National Museums Scotland, who was part of the international team that studied the fossil, said this was the first time scientists had been able to see it in full. He described it as ""a very strange animal"".
""It had flipper-like limbs and its neck is longer than its body and tail combined,"" he said.
The researcher speculated that a ""long, bendy and flexible neck"", with its 32 separate vertebrae, might have provided a hunting advantage - allowing Dinocephalosaurus orientalis to search for food in crevices under the water.
The fossil was discovered in ancient limestone deposits in southern China.
""This discovery just adds to the weirdness of the Triassic,"" Dr Fraser told BBC News. ""And every time we look in these deposits, we find something new.""

2024-03-07T03:06:49.000Z,More climate records fall in world's warmest February,BBC News,"Last month was the world's warmest February in modern times, the EU's climate service says, extending the run of monthly records to nine in a row.
Each month since June 2023 has seen new temperature highs for the time of year.
The world's sea surface is at its hottest on record, while Antarctic sea-ice has again reached extreme lows.
Temperatures are still being boosted by the Pacific's El Niño weather event, but human-caused climate change is by far the main driver of the warmth.
""Heat-trapping greenhouse gases are unequivocally the main culprit,"" stresses Prof Celeste Saulo, Secretary General of the World Meteorological Organization.
Carbon dioxide concentrations are at their highest level for at least two million years, according to the UN's climate body, and increased by near-record levels again over the past year.
Those warming gases helped make February 2024 about 1.77C warmer than ""pre-industrial"" times - before humans started burning large amounts of fossil fuels - according to the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service.
This breaks the previous record, from 2016, by around 0.12C.
These temperatures saw particularly severe heat afflict western Australia, southeast Asia, southern Africa and South America.
The 12-month average now sits at 1.56C above pre-industrial levels - after the first year-long breach of 1.5C warming was confirmed last month.
Back in 2015 in Paris, nearly 200 countries agreed to try to keep the rise in warming under 1.5C, to help avoid some of the worst climate impacts.
That threshold in the Paris agreement is generally accepted to mean a 20-year average - so it hasn't yet been broken - but the relentless string of records illustrates how close the world is getting to doing so.
Recent records haven't just been limited to air temperatures. Countless climate metrics are far beyond levels seen in modern times.
One of the most notable is sea surface temperatures. As the graph below shows, the margin of records in recent months has been particularly striking.
Researchers are keen to stress that the scale and extent of the oceanic heat is not simply a consequence of the natural weather event known as El Niño, which was declared in June 2023.
""Ocean surface temperatures in the equatorial Pacific clearly reflect El Niño. But sea surface temperatures in other parts of the globe have been persistently and unusually high for the past 10 months,"" explains Prof Saulo.
""This is worrying and cannot be explained by El Niño alone.""
Ocean warming has prompted concerns about the mass bleaching of coral reefs. It also raises global sea-levels and can help to fuel higher intensity hurricanes.
Unusually warm waters may also have been a factor in another exceptional month for Antarctic sea-ice. The three lowest minimum extents in the satellite era have now occurred in the last three years.
Scientists are struggling to explain exactly what's going on.
Until 2017, Antarctic sea-ice had defied predictions that it would shrink, unlike in the Arctic, where the downward trend has been much clearer.
The apparent recent shift - occurring at the same time as other records are being broken around the planet - adds to concerns that Antarctic sea-ice may finally be waking up to climate change.
""I don't think you can say it's coincidental,"" Prof Martin Siegert, a glaciologist at the University of Exeter, told BBC News.
""It's absolutely frightening. The records are just off [the] scale.""
There are signs that the run of global temperature records may finally come to an end in the months ahead.
The 2023-24 El Niño has been one of the five strongest such events on record, the World Meteorological Organization announced on Tuesday, but it is gradually weakening.
El Niño will continue to have an effect on temperatures and weather patterns for the next few months.
""We would expect [El Niño] to continue to keep 2024 temperatures elevated at least through the first half of the year,"" Dr Colin Morice, a senior scientist at the UK's Met Office Hadley Centre, told BBC News.
However, a switch to neutral conditions in the Pacific is likely between April and June, according to US science body NOAA, and a further switch to the cool phase known as La Niña could then happen between June and August.
This would likely put a temporary lid on global air temperatures, with a cooler sea surface in the East Pacific allowing less heat to escape and warm the air.
But as long as human activities keep releasing huge amounts of greenhouse gases, temperatures will continue rising in the long-term, ultimately leading to more records and extreme weather.
""We know what to do - stop burning fossil fuels and replace them with more sustainable, renewable sources of energy,"" says Dr Friederike Otto, senior lecturer in climate science at Imperial College London.
""Until we do that, extreme weather events intensified by climate change will continue to destroy lives and livelihoods.""

2024-01-29T14:39:15.000Z,Moon lander: Japan's Slim reactivates and gets to work,BBC News,"As the Japanese Space Agency put it: ""Operations resumed!""
After the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (Jaxa) re-established contact with its Moon lander on Sunday night, the craft started to study its surroundings in detail and transmit new images to Earth.
The lander is carrying out analysis that could inform future, much longer missions to the Moon.
One lunar scientist told BBC News: ""Now we're really seeing the science.""
The craft is at a very awkward angle. A picture, captured by the small baseball-sized robot called Sora-Q - which was ejected from Slim moments before touchdown - showed the lander face-down on the lunar surface.
That left its solar panels facing away from the sunlight and unable to generate power. The decision was taken to put the lander into sleep mode - and conserve what power remained -  less than three hours after it landed.
That tactic appears to have worked. A change in the direction of the sunlight has now ""awoken"" the craft.
The mission team had already been able to study images of the landing site and have picked out specific rocks in the area and given each one the name of a dog breed - apparently to give an indication of the size of each rock. On Monday, the team released a grey, rocky close-up image - this was the lander's scientific camera zooming in on a rock that has been named ""toy poodle"".
It might not look like a spectacular photograph, but the snapshot was taken with what is called the Multi-Band Camera or MBC, which can essentially capture images that reveal the composition of the rock.
""The camera responds differently - in different wavelengths - to each of the minerals that are in this rock,"" explained Open University lunar scientist Dr Simeon Barber.
Seeing that will enable scientists to build up a picture of the Moon's history. ""If toy poodle is completely different to the rocks around it, that might suggest it was transported there by an impact event,"" explained Dr Barber. ""So all this detail allows us to piece together more about what's happened on the Moon since it was formed.""
Being able to pinpoint rocks and examine them in this way could also reveal substances on the lunar surface that future missions might be able to use to make fuel or provide a water supply.
""This detailed geology is the cherry on the icing on the cake,"" said Dr Barber. ""[The mission is] already a success in my mind - I think engineering so far has been fantastic.""
It is not yet clear how long the craft will be able to operate - it all hinges on the angle of the Sun and solar panels.
The Sun will eventually set on the lander and Jaxa has previously warned that it was not designed to survive a lunar night, when the surface of the Moon is not exposed to the Sun for about 14 days.
But mission engineers have already achieved their pinpoint landing target of getting within 100m (330ft) of their intended landing site.

2024-02-08T10:18:33.000Z,World's first year-long breach of key 1.5C warming limit,BBC News,"For the first time, global warming has exceeded 1.5C across an entire year, according to the EU's climate service.
World leaders promised in 2015 to try to limit the long-term temperature rise to 1.5C, which is seen as crucial to help avoid the most damaging impacts.
This first year-long breach doesn't break that landmark Paris agreement, but it does bring the world closer to doing so in the long-term.
Urgent action to cut carbon emissions can still slow warming, scientists say.
""This far exceeds anything that is acceptable,"" Prof Sir Bob Watson, a former chair of the UN's climate body, told the BBC Radio 4's Today Programme.
""Look what's happened this year with only 1.5C - we've seen floods, we've seen droughts, we've seen heatwaves and wildfires all over the world.""
The period from February 2023 to January 2024 reached 1.52C of warming, according to the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service. The following graph shows how that compares with previous years.
The latest climate warning comes amid news that the Labour Party is ditching its policy of spending £28bn a year on its green investment plan in a major U-turn. The Conservatives also pushed back on some key targets in September.
This means the UK's two main parties have scaled back the type of pledges that many climate scientists say are needed globally if the worst impacts of warming are to be avoided.
The world's sea surface is also at its highest ever recorded average temperature - yet another sign of the widespread nature of climate records. As the chart below shows, it's particularly notable given that ocean temperatures don't normally peak for another month or so.
Science groups differ slightly on precisely how much temperatures have increased, but all agree that the world is in by far its warmest period since modern records began - and likely for much longer.
Limiting long-term warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels - before humans started burning large amounts of fossil fuels - has become a key symbol of international efforts to tackle climate change.
A landmark UN report in 2018 said that the risks from climate change - such as intense heatwaves, rising sea-levels and loss of wildlife - were much higher at 2C of warming than at 1.5C.
The long-term warming trend is unquestionably being driven by human activities - mainly from burning fossil fuels, which releases planet-warming gases like carbon dioxide. This is also responsible for the vast majority of the warmth over the past year.
In recent months, a natural climate-warming phenomenon known as El Niño has also given air temperatures an extra boost, although it would typically only do so by about 0.2C.
Global average air temperatures began exceeding 1.5C of warming on an almost daily basis in the second half of 2023, when El Niño began kicking in, and this has continued into 2024. This is shown where the red line is above the dashed line in the graph below.
An end to El Niño conditions is expected in a few months, which could allow global temperatures to temporarily stabilise, and then fall slightly, probably back below the 1.5C threshold.
But while human activities keep adding to the levels of warming gases in the atmosphere, temperatures will ultimately continue rising in the decades ahead.
At the current rate of emissions, the Paris goal of limiting warming to 1.5C as a long-term average - rather than a single year - could be crossed within the next decade.
This would be a hugely symbolic milestone, but researchers say it wouldn't mark a cliff edge beyond which climate change will spin out of control.
The impacts of climate change would continue to accelerate, however with every little increase in warming - something that the extreme heatwaves, droughts, wildfires and floods over the past 12 months have given us a taste of.
An extra half a degree - the difference between 1.5C and 2C of global warming - also greatly increases the risks of passing so-called tipping points.
These are thresholds within the climate system which, if crossed, could lead to rapid and potentially irreversible changes.
For example, if the Greenland and West Antarctic Ice Sheets passed a tipping point, their potentially runaway collapse could cause catastrophic rises to global sea-levels over the centuries that followed.
But researchers are keen to emphasise that humans can still make a difference to the world's warming trajectory.
The world has made some progress, with green technologies like renewables and electric vehicles booming in many parts of the world.
This has meant some of the very worst case scenarios of 4C warming or more this century - thought possible a decade ago - are now considered much less likely, based on current policies and pledges.
And perhaps most encouragingly of all, it's still thought that the world will more or less stop warming once net zero carbon emissions are reached. Effectively halving emissions this decade is seen as particularly crucial.
""That means we can ultimately control how much warming the world experiences, based on our choices as a society, and as a planet,"" says Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist at US group Berkeley Earth.
""Doom is not inevitable.""

2024-02-08T11:38:38.000Z,What is climate change? A really simple guide,BBC News,"Human activities are causing world temperatures to rise, with more intense heatwaves and rising sea-levels among the consequences.
Things are likely to worsen in the coming decades, but scientists argue urgent action can limit the worst effects of climate change.
Climate change is the long-term shift in the Earth's average temperatures and weather conditions.
Over the last decade, the world was on average around 1.2C warmer than during the late 19th Century.
It has now been confirmed that global warming exceeded 1.5C across the 12 month period between February 2023 and January 2024. That followed 2023 being declared the warmest year on record.
The temperature increase was driven by human-caused climate change and boosted by the natural El Niño weather phenomenon.
The climate has changed throughout the Earth's history and natural factors, such as El Niño, can affect the weather for shorter periods of time, as happened in 2023.
But natural causes cannot explain the particularly rapid warming seen in the last century, according to the UN's climate body, the IPCC.
This long-term climate change has been caused by human activity, the IPCC says, mainly from the widespread use of fossil fuels - coal, oil and gas - in homes, factories and transport.
When fossil fuels burn, they release greenhouse gases - mostly carbon dioxide (CO2). This traps extra energy in the atmosphere near the Earth's surface, causing the planet to heat up.
Since the start of the Industrial Revolution - when humans started burning large amounts of fossil fuels - the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has risen by about 50%.
The CO2 released from burning fossil fuels has a distinctive chemical fingerprint which matches the type increasingly found in the atmosphere.
The global average temperature increase of 1.2C seen in the past decade might not sound much.
However, it has had a huge effect on the environment, including:
People's lives are also changing.
For example, parts of East Africa suffered their worst drought in 40 years, putting more than 20 million people at risk of severe hunger.
In 2022, intense European heatwaves led to an abnormal increase in deaths.
The more average temperatures increase, the worse the impacts of climate change become.
Limiting long-term average temperature rises to 1.5Cis crucial, according to the IPCC.
The science is not completely certain, but the consequences of 2C global warming versus 1.5C could include:
The call to limit temperature rise to 1.5C was partly designed to avoid crossing so-called ""tipping points"".
After these thresholds are passed, changes could accelerate and become irreversible, such as the collapse of the Greenland Ice Sheet. However, it's not clear precisely where these thresholds sit.
About 3.3 to 3.6 billion people are highly vulnerable to climate change, according to the IPCC.
People living in poorer countries are expected to suffer most as they have fewer resources to adapt.
This has led to questions about fairness, because these places have typically only been responsible for a small percentage of greenhouse gas emissions.
However, knock-on impacts could be felt over wide areas. For example, crop failures linked to extreme weather could raise global food prices.
In a landmark agreement signed in Paris in 2015, almost 200 countries pledged to try to keep global warming to 1.5C.
To achieve this, ""net zero"" CO2 emissions should be reached by 2050. Net zero means reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible, and removing any remaining emissions from the atmosphere.
Most countries have, or are considering, net zero targets.
However, greenhouse gas levels are still rising quickly and the world is ""likely"" to warm beyond 1.5C, the IPCC says.
However, there has been progress in some areas such as the growth of renewable energy and electric vehicles.
World leaders meet every year to discuss their climate commitments.
The most recent UN climate change summit, COP28, was held in the United Arab Emirates. For the first time, countries agreed to ""contribute"" to ""transitioning away from fossil fuels"", although they are not forced to take action.
The next conference, COP29, will be held in Azerbaijan in November 2024.
Major changes need to come from governments and businesses, but individuals can also help:

2024-01-30T00:00:13.000Z,England's hedges would go around Earth ten times,BBC News,"England's hedgerows would stretch almost ten times around the Earth if lined up end to end.
That's according to a new map - the most comprehensive to date - of these historic features of the landscape.
Ecologists hope the data will lead to better protections for the much-loved lines of trees and shrubs that provide food and shelter for wildlife, and store large amounts of carbon.
Laser scanning from the air reveals a total of 390,000 km of hedges.
The South West boasts the most hedgerows, led by Cornwall.
Surrey, Hampshire and Berkshire are the counties with the least - excluding big urban areas.
""We've probably got more hedgerows in England than anywhere else in the world so we're very lucky to have this huge resource,""  said Dr Richard Broughton of the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, who led the project.
""As a national policy, we're trying to expand hedgerows in this country, and this will tell us where there are gaps in the hedgerow network that we could fill in.""
Hedgerows have been part of the rural fabric of Britain since the Bronze Age, marking out boundaries and keeping in cattle.
They contain hundreds of different wild plants, provide shelter for nesting birds, small mammals and insects, and can capture and store large amounts of carbon.
About half of Britain's hedgerows were lost between the 1940s and 1990s, mostly in England, due to intensive farming and development
While the loss has slowed since the 1990s, neglect, damage and removal remain big threats.
The new map is based on aerial laser scanning of England's entire landscape using Lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) remote sensing data.
Previous analyses have relied on estimates scaled up from field surveys.
""This is the first time we've been able to map with Lidar the whole country, which means that you don't have to walk every hedgerow,"" said Dr Broughton.
""You can just do a sample of it and then scale up from there. This gives us more detail than we've had before on such a large scale.""
The new data calculates there are 390,000 km of hedgerows in England measuring between 1 and 6 metres in height.
Additionally, there are another 67,000 km of lower hedges and a further 185,000 km of overgrown hedges above 6m tall.
The map found:
The government has promised to create or restore 48,000 km of hedgerows by 2037, and 72,000 km of hedgerows by 2050, under the new Environmental Improvement Plan released a year ago.

2024-03-04T13:48:18.000Z,The last of the Moon men: the stories of the surviving Apollo astronauts,BBC News,"They were the pioneers of space exploration - the 24 Nasa astronauts who travelled to the Moon in the Apollo missions of the 1960s and 1970s.
Now, more than 50 years on, the race to put people back on the lunar surface is set to heat up once again.
A number of private companies are scheduled to send scientific craft to the Moon in 2024. The first of these, Peregrine, ran into trouble shortly after launch, and while the second made it to the lunar surface, it broke one of its legs while landing.
Nasa had intended to launch Artemis 2, its first crewed lunar expedition since Apollo 17, later this year but that date has slipped into 2025, as the space agency says it needs more time to prepare.
Nasa hopes the new programme will lead to astronauts living on the Moon this decade. China is also aiming to have people on the lunar surface by 2030.
These delays highlight the sad fact that the number of remaining Apollo astronauts is dwindling. The programme's Ken Mattingly and Frank Borman died within a few days of each other late last year.
Now just eight people remain, who have escaped the relative safety of Earth orbit and ventured deeper into space.
Who are they, and what are their stories?
On 21 July 1969, former fighter pilot Edwin ""Buzz"" Aldrin left his lunar landing craft and became the second person to step on the surface of the Moon. Almost 20 minutes beforehand, his commander, Neil Armstrong, had been the first.
Aldrin's first words were: ""Beautiful view"".
""Isn't that something?"" asked Armstrong.""Magnificent sight out here.""
""Magnificent desolation,"" replied Aldrin.
The fact that he was second never sat comfortably with him. His crewmate Michael Collins said Aldrin ""resented not being first on the Moon more than he appreciated being second"".
But Aldrin was still proud of his achievement; many years later, when confronted by a man claiming Apollo 11 was an elaborate lie, the 72-year-old Aldrin punched him on the jaw.
And following Neil Armstrong's death in 2012, Aldrin said: ""I know I am joined by many millions of others from around the world in mourning the passing of a true American hero and the best pilot I ever knew.""
Despite struggles in later life, he never lost his thirst for adventure and joined expeditions to both the North and South Poles, the latter at the age of 86.
While embracing his celebrity, he has remained an advocate for the space programme, especially the need to explore Mars.
""I don't think we should just go there and come back - we did that with Apollo,"" he says.
And his name has become known to new generations as the inspiration for Buzz Lightyear from the Toy Story series of films. In January 2023, at the age of 93, he married for a fourth time.
In December 1968, Bill Anders flew on Apollo 8, the first mission in which humans travelled beyond low Earth orbit, and the first crewed flight to reach and orbit the Moon.
When the spacecraft came out from behind the Moon for the fourth pass across its face, the crew witnessed an ""Earthrise"" for the first time in human history, Anders capturing the moment on film.
The image is widely credited with motivating the global environmental movement and leading to the creation of Earth Day, an annual event to promote activism and awareness of caring for the planet.
Speaking of the moment, Anders said: ""We came all this way to explore the Moon, and the most important thing that we discovered was the Earth.""
Following his retirement from the space programme in 1969, Anders largely worked in the aerospace industry for several decades. He also served as US Ambassador to Norway for a year in the 1970s.
There are only four people still alive who have walked on the Moon - Charlie Duke is one of them. He did it aged 36, making him the youngest person to set foot on the lunar surface.
In a later BBC interview, he spoke of a ""spectacular terrain"".
""The beauty of it… the sharp contrast between the blackness of space and the horizon of the Moon… I'll never forget it. It was so dramatic.""
But he had already played another significant role in Nasa's exploration of the Moon. After Apollo 11 touched down in 1969, it was Duke - in mission control as the Capsule Communicator, or Capcom - who was waiting nervously on the other end of the line when Neil Armstrong said: ""Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed.""
In his distinctive southern drawl, Duke replied: ""Roger, Tranquility. We copy you on the ground, you've got a bunch of guys about to turn blue, we're breathing again.""
""I really meant it, I was holding my breath the last minute or so,"" he later told the BBC.
In 2022, Duke told the BBC he was excited about Nasa's Artemis mission - but warned that it wouldn't be easy for the new generation of astronauts.
""They've picked near the South Pole for the landing, because if there's any ice on the Moon, it would be down in that region. So that's gonna be difficult - because it's really rough down there. But we'll pull it off.""
Charlie Duke now lives outside San Antonio, Texas, with Dorothy, to whom he has been married for 60 years.
Fred Haise was part of the crew of Apollo 13 that narrowly avoided disaster in 1970 after an on-board explosion caused the mission to be aborted when the craft was more than 200,000 miles (321,000km) from Earth.
The whole world watched nervously as Nasa attempted to return the damaged spacecraft and its crew safely. Once back, Haise and his crewmates James Lovell and Jack Swigert became celebrities, to their apparent surprise.
""I feel like maybe I missed something while I was up there,"" he told talk show host Johnny Carson when the crew appeared on The Tonight Show.
Haise never made it to the Moon. Although scheduled to be commander of Apollo 19, that mission was cancelled because of budget cuts, as were all other flights after Apollo 17.
He later served as a test pilot on the prototype space shuttle, Enterprise.
Like many of his fellow Apollo alumni, after leaving Nasa, Haise continued to work in the aerospace industry until his retirement.
Lovell, Borman and Anders made history when they undertook the first lunar mission on Apollo 8, testing the Command/Service Module and its life support systems in preparation for the later Apollo 11 landing.
Their craft actually made 10 orbits of the Moon before returning home. Lovell was later supposed be the fifth human to walk on the lunar surface as commander of Apollo 13 - but of course, that never happened.
Instead the story of his brush with death was immortalised in the film Apollo 13, in which he was played by Tom Hanks.
Following his retirement from Nasa in 1973, Lovell worked in the telecoms industry. Marilyn, his wife of more than 60 years, who became a focus for the media during the infamous incident, died in August 2023.
Jim Lovell is one of only three men to have travelled to the Moon twice, and following Frank Borman's death in November 2023, he became the oldest living astronaut.
Unlike most other astronauts of the time, Schmitt had not served as a pilot in the US forces.
A geologist and academic, he initially instructed Nasa astronauts on what to look for during their geological lunar field trips before becoming a scientist-astronaut himself in 1965.
Schmitt was part of the last crewed mission to the Moon, Apollo 17, and along with commander Eugene Cernan, one of the last two men to set foot on the lunar surface, in December 1972.
After leaving Nasa in 1975, he was elected to the US Senate from his home state of New Mexico, but only served one term. Since then he has worked as a consultant in various industries as well as continuing in academia.
He is also known for speaking out against the scientific consensus on climate change.
David Scott, the commander of the Apollo 15, is one of just four men alive who have walked on the Moon - but he was also one of the first to drive on it too.
In 1971, Scott and crewmate James Irwin tested out the Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV), ""Man's First Wheels on the Moon"" as it was called. Travelling at speeds up to 8 mph (12 km/h) the LRV allowed astronauts to travel large distances from the lunar lander much quicker than they could walk.
""On a first mission you never know whether it's going to work,"" he later recalled. ""The greatest thrill was to get it out, turn it on, and it actually worked.""
After returning from the Moon, Scott worked in various management roles within Nasa, before joining the private sector.
He has also acted as consultant on several film and television projects, including Apollo 13 and the HBO miniseries From The Earth To The Moon.
As commander of Apollo 10 in May 1969, Tom Stafford led the final test mission for the programme before the planned landing of Apollo 11.
On that mission, Stafford and pilot Eugene Cernan became the first crew to fly the lunar landing module outside Earth orbit.
Shortly after his return, Stafford was appointed chief of the Astronaut Office, a role he held for almost two years.
In 1975 he was Nasa's commander of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project flight, the first joint space mission between the US and then-Soviet Union, and a precursor to the International Space Station. His Soviet counterpart, Alexey Leonov, became a lifelong friend.
Together they had participated in the momentous handshake in orbit, something that would have been unimaginable at the height of the space race.
What will the next generation of lunar adventurers accomplish?

2024-02-07T00:50:59.000Z,Climate change: 'Godfathers of wind' share engineering's QEPrize,BBC News,"Two men who made critical contributions to the development of wind power will share the £500,000 QEPrize, nicknamed the ""Nobel of engineering"".
Denmark's Henrik Stiesdal framed the early design principles for wind turbines and led the installation of the world's first offshore wind farm.
The UK's Andrew Garrad developed the computer models that optimise and certify turbine and farm designs.
Their innovations had changed the world, the judges said.
And they had ""enabled wind energy to fulfil a crucial role in today's electricity generation mix"".
The 2024 Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering laureates were announced at a ceremony in London's Science Museum, on Tuesday evening, in the presence of the Princess Royal.
Their recognition follows last year's award to the pioneers of solar power.
Previous QE Prize winners
Mr Stiesdal and Mr Garrad began their wind journeys in the 1970s, both building ""backyard"" turbines.
The Dane was driven by concerns about energy costs arising from that decade's oil shocks.
The Briton sought a practical use for his mathematical skills, following a PhD modelling water flow around fast-swimming dolphins.
Mr Stiesdal is associated with what became known as the ""Danish concept"", setting the fundamental parameters for efficient and robust turbine design:
""Of course, today's turbines are much more advanced - but they still retain many of the early features,"" Mr Stiesdal told BBC News.
""All the turbines in the world go clockwise when you look at them with the wind in your back, because that's how the original Danish turbines worked.
""For a while, half went counterclockwise - but now, they all go clockwise because people recognised the success of the early designs.""
Mr Stiesdal licensed his concept to Vestas, working for them and introducing many innovations over a number of years, before moving to Bonus (later acquired by Siemens), where he managed the 1991 installation of the world's first offshore wind farm, at Vindeby.
With 17m (56ft) blades, its turbine rotors could generate 450 kW, enough to power a couple of thousand Danish homes.
Now, after 30 years of technological improvement, blades over 120m can generate 16 MW, enough to power tens of thousands of homes.
Mr Garrad developed the software to prove a new turbine design will work and how it will operate within an array.
As a consultant, he has also played a major part in de-risking the industry, enabling it to access the finance needed to expand at a rapid pace.
""Being the go-between between the engineering and the finance has been really important,"" he said.
""We've touched pretty much every every turbine.
""About 70% of all turbines will have used our software in design.
""And for the 30% that didn't, they probably came into contact with our software when they were being certified by a certification agent.""
When Mr Stiesdal and Mr Garrad began their careers, wind energy was an insignificant component of the energy mix.
It took 40 years to achieve 1 TW of global installed capacity - but most commentators expect the next one to be installed before the end of the decade.
Already, more than 8% of electricity generation worldwide is wind - and in the UK, it is close to a third.
Further innovation in floating turbines will see farms go into much deeper waters.
And, in general, the rotating machines will become taller still.
Mr Stiesdal says no blade-tip should rise higher than the Eiffel Tower, 330m, however, and the industry should instead concentrate on cutting the unit cost of production even further.
Lord Browne of Madingley, who chairs the Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering Foundation, said: ""I remember even 15 years ago, people said, 'Wind power, windmills - a ridiculous idea - they won't work for the long term.'
""And, actually, there were plenty of very distinguished engineers who were very negative about wind power.
""But it's been a remarkable journey, all thanks to these two evangelists, who made change happen.""
Prof Dame Lynn Gladden, who chairs the QEPrize judges, said the two men's achievements could not be separated.
""I don't think they could have got to where they got without each other's contributions,"" she told BBC News.
""These are the guys who laid the foundations for it all.
""The principles they developed, they shared and encouraged others to follow.
""If you removed one of them, you haven't got the technology we have today - we wouldn't be where we are now.""

2024-01-24T11:02:00.000Z,World's first IVF rhino pregnancy 'could save species',BBC News,"A fertility breakthrough has offered hope for saving the northern white rhino from extinction - there are only two of the animals left on the planet.
Scientists have achieved the world's first IVF rhino pregnancy, successfully transferring a lab-created rhino embryo into a surrogate mother.
The procedure was carried out with southern white rhinos, a closely related sub-species of northern whites.
The next step is to repeat this with northern white embryos.
""To achieve the first successful embryo transfer in a rhino is a huge step,"" said Susanne Holtze, a scientist at Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in Germany, which is part of the Biorescue project, an international consortium trying to save this species.
""But now I think with this achievement, we are very confident that we will be able to create northern white rhinos in the same manner and that we will be able to save the species.""
Northern white rhinos were once found across central Africa, but illegal poaching, fuelled by the demand for rhino horn, wiped out the wild population.
Now only two rhinos remain: two females, Najin and her daughter Fatu. Both of the former zoo animals are kept under tight security at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya.
Unable to reproduce, the species is technically extinct. But now the Biorescue team has turned to radical fertility science to bring these animals back from the brink.
They started their work using southern white rhinos. This close cousin of the northern whites has a population of thousands - and is considered a conservation success story although it's still threatened by illegal hunting.
The project has taken years and has had to overcome many challenges: from working out how to collect eggs from the two-tonne animals, to creating the first-ever rhino embryos in a lab and trying to establish how - and when - to implant them.
It took 13 attempts to achieve the first viable IVF pregnancy using southern white rhinos.
""It's very challenging in such a big animal, in terms of placing an embryo inside the reproductive tract, which is almost 2m inside the animal,"" Susanne Holtze told BBC News.
The embryo, which was made using an egg from a female southern white from a zoo in Belgium and fertilized with sperm from a male in Austria, was transferred into a southern white surrogate female in Kenya, who became pregnant.
However, the success was followed by tragedy.
Seventy days into the pregnancy, the surrogate mother died after becoming infected with Clostridia - a bacteria found in the soil that can be deadly to animals.
The death dealt a blow to the team - a post-mortem revealed that the 6.5cm male foetus was developing well and had a 95% chance of being born alive.
But it showed that the technique had worked and that a viable pregnancy through rhino IVF was possible. Now the next step is to try this using northern white rhino embryos.
There are only 30 of these precious embryos in existence, stored in liquid nitrogen in Germany and Italy.
They were created using eggs harvested from Fatu, the younger female in Kenya, and sperm collected from two male northern white rhinos before they died.
However, the birth of a northern white calf will require another scientific first.
Neither of the last two surviving northern whites can carry a pregnancy because of a combination of age and health problems. So instead the embryo will be implanted into the womb of a surrogate southern white rhino.
IVF across a sub species has never been tried before, but the team is confident it will work.
Prof Thomas Hildebrandt, the director of Liebniz IZW and project head for the Biorescue Consortium, said: ""I think the situation for the northern white rhino is quite privileged for the embryo transfer because we have a closely related recipient - so their internal map is nearly the same.""
The Biorescue team hopes to implant the embryos in the coming months. They want the calf to be born while some northern white rhinos are still alive.
""We want to preserve the social communication, the social heritage of the northern white rhino by putting the first calf on the ground so they can learn the language from the last two rhinos, they can learn how to behave from them,"" explained Prof Hildebrandt.
The researchers are aware that adding some more animals through IVF will not save this species - there wouldn't be enough genetic diversity to create a viable population.
So they are simultaneously working on an even more experimental technique, attempting to create rhino sperm and eggs from stem cells, to go on to produce embryos.
Again, this will take time and there will be many scientific challenges to overcome.
Some wildlife experts also argue that pouring more money and resources into a species that's as good as lost could be better used in saving more viable species.
However, Jan Stejskal, the BioRescue project coordinator from Safari Park Dvur Kralove in the Czech Republic where Najin and Fatu were originally from, said: ""One thing that we have to understand is that behind the extinction of the northern white rhino is man. It's not because of some evolutionary pressure, it was greed, it was the consumption of a rhino horn.
""So, in a way, we are responsible and if we actually have a technique that can assist us to save them, then I think we have a responsibility to use it and to try to save them.""
Samuel Mutisya, head of research and species conservation at Ol Pejeta, added that the northern whites were a critical party of the ecosystem and the team was ""committed to do all that is humanly possible to nurture, protect and recover the species"".

2024-01-12T02:33:24.000Z,Huge ring of galaxies challenges thinking on cosmos,BBC News,"Scientists at the University of Central Lancashire have discovered a gigantic, ring-shaped structure in space.
It is 1.3bn light-years in diameter and appears to be roughly 15 times the size of the Moon in the night sky as seen from Earth.
Named the Big Ring by the astronomers, it is made up of galaxies and galaxy clusters.
They say that it is so big it challenges our understanding of the universe.
It cannot be seen with the naked eye. It is really distant and identifying all the galaxies that make up the bigger structure has taken a lot of time and computing power.
Such large structures should not exist according to one of the guiding principles of astronomy, called the cosmological principle. This states that all matter is spread smoothly across the Universe.
Although stars, planets and galaxies are huge clumps of matter in our eyes, in the context of the size of the universe they are insignificant - and the theory is that much bigger patches of matter should not form.
The Big Ring is by no means the first likely violation of the cosmological principle and so suggests that there is another, yet to be discovered, factor at play.
According to Dr Robert Massey, deputy director of the Royal Astronomical Society, the evidence for a rethink of what has been a central plank of astronomy is growing.
""This is the seventh large structure discovered in the universe that contradicts the idea that the cosmos is smooth on the largest scales. If these structures are real, then it's definitely food for thought for cosmologists and the accepted thinking on how the universe has evolved over time,"" he said.
The Big Ring was identified by Alexia Lopez, a PhD student at the University of Central Lancashire (UCLan), who also discovered the Giant Arc - a structure spanning 3.3bn light-years of space.
Asked how it felt to have made the discoveries, she said: ""It's really surreal. I do have to pinch myself, because I made these discoveries accidentally, they were serendipitous discoveries. But it is a big thing and I can't believe that I'm talking about it, I don't believe that it's me
""Neither of these two ultra-large structures is easy to explain in our current understanding of the universe,"" she said.
""And their ultra-large sizes, distinctive shapes, and cosmological proximity must surely be telling us something important - but what exactly?""
The giant arcs that may dwarf everything
Both the Big Ring and the Giant Arc appear relatively close together, near the constellation of Bootes the Herdsman.
Professor Don Pollacco, of the department of physics at the University of Warwick, said the likelihood of this occurring is vanishingly small so the two objects might be related and form an even larger structure.
""So the question is how do you make such large structures?
""It's incredibly hard to conceive of any mechanism that could produce these structures so instead the authors speculate that we are seeing a relic from the early universe where waves of high and low density material are 'frozen' in to extragalactic medium.""
There are also similarly large structures discovered by other cosmologists - such as the Sloan Great Wall, which is around 1.5 billion light-years in length, and the South Pole Wall, which stretches 1.4 billion light-years across.
But the biggest single entity scientists have identified is a supercluster of galaxies called the Hercules-Corona Borealis Great Wall, which is about 10 billion light-years wide.
While the Big Ring appears as an almost perfect ring on the sky, analysis by Ms Lopez suggests it has more of a coil shape - like a corkscrew - with its face aligned with Earth.
""The Big Ring and the Giant Arc, both individually and together, gives us a big cosmological mystery as we work to understand the universe and its development.""
The findings have been presented at the 243rd meeting of the American Astronomical Society (AAS) in New Orleans.

2024-02-15T12:02:03.000Z,US stingray falls pregnant despite having no mate,BBC News,"A stingray called Charlotte is pregnant despite not sharing her tank with a male for at least eight years.
Charlotte is a rust-coloured round stingray that has spent most of her life in an aquarium in North Carolina.
Staff originally thought that Charlotte's pregnancy was a tumour after noticing a growing lump on her back.
She could have as many as four young in the next two weeks, according to the aquarium's owner.
The pregnancy is likely due to a phenomenon called parthenogenesis.
This is a form of asexual reproduction where a female egg is fertilized without the sperm from a male.
The process can occur in some species like insects, reptiles and even some fish.
Dr Kady Lyons, a research scientist for Georgia Aquarium, who is not involved with the North Carolina aquarium, spoke to the Associated Press and said Charlotte's pregnancy was the only documented example she was aware of for this species.
Dr Lyons explained that these animals are not cloning themselves. Instead, a female's egg fuses with another cell, triggering cell division which leads to the creation of an embryo.

If the firm succeeds, it will be the first ever commercial venture to achieve the feat.
It would also represent the first American soft landing on the lunar surface since the Apollo era just over half a century ago.
IM has been contracted by the US space agency (Nasa) to carry scientific instruments to the Moon's south pole.
The targeted landing site is a cratered terrain next to a 5km-high mountain complex known as Malapert. The region is one of the locations on Nasa's shortlist of places to send astronauts later this decade as part of its Artemis programme.
The instrumentation should give planners some fresh insights on what surface conditions are like.
Controllers at Intuitive Machines are aiming for a touchdown around 23:24 GMT, although the company has shifted this time back and forth in recent hours.
""The six Nasa payloads and six commercial payloads expect to operate on the lunar surface for seven days before the Sun sets on our landing site at Malapert A Crater on the south pole of the Moon, rendering the IM-1 mission complete. During this time, we will be performing some amazing experiments and technology demonstrations,"" said Trent Martin, the company's vice president of space systems.
IM's effort follows that of another private concern, Pittsburgh-based Astrobotic, which set off for the Moon in early January but couldn't even attempt a landing because of technical problems.
The Japanese space agency (Jaxa) had better fortune at the end of the month, reaching the surface safely on 19 January, although it lost several days of operations because it landed awkwardly, leaving its solar array pointing away from the Sun.
IM's 675kg Odysseus lander is about the size of an old British telephone box. It was despatched from Earth on 15 February and was captured into orbit around the Moon on Wednesday this week.
Controllers will monitor the spacecraft's descent at the company HQ in Houston but it will be Odysseus itself that will be taking the key decisions on approach.
Initially at 100km altitude, Odysseus will use its guidance system to bring itself to a point roughly 30km above the designated landing site, and then drop straight down. The big engine on board is expected to slow the descent to just one-metre-per-second at the moment of landing.
If the mission gets down safely it will be the southernmost landing yet executed. The Indian space agency (Isro) currently holds this record, thanks to its historic Chandrayaan-3 Vikram lander, which settled on the lunar terrain in August last year at 69 degrees South.
IM's target is at 80 degrees South, a mere 300km from the south pole proper.
The mission is part of Nasa's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) programme, in which the agency is paying various private American companies for transport services to the Moon - in this particular case, with a fee of $118M (£93m).
""With commercial industry comes a competitive environment, which means that our investment up front ultimately gets far more for far less,"" explained Nasa's CLPS project scientist Susan Lederer.
""Instead of one (Nasa) mission in a decade, it allows for more like 10 commercial missions to the Moon in a decade; instead of four or five instruments in that one decade, it's more like four to five dozen instruments.""
Nasa's six instruments are joined on Odysseus by payloads from six other IM customers.
These include a student camera system from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University which will be deployed from Odysseus when it is still 30m above the lunar surface. The camera will try to take selfie images as the spacecraft touches down.
The American artist Jeff Koons has also attached a box to the side of the lander that contains 125 small stainless steel balls to represent the Moon's different phases through a month.
And there'll even be a telescope from the International Lunar Observatory Association on board, taking pictures of the Milky Way Galaxy. The Moon is an ideal place to do astronomical research because it doesn't suffer from some of the confounding effects experienced on Earth, such as a blurry atmosphere and radio interference.
Nasa's payloads will concentrate on getting information that will be useful to future human exploration. There are novel technologies on Odysseus to aid precise navigation and to know exactly how much propellant is available to a craft's thrusters.
There will also be investigations of lunar dust, which the Apollo astronauts found to be a serious nuisance, scratching and clogging their equipment.
The agency's scientists want to understand better how the dust is kicked up by landing craft to hang just above the surface before then eventually settling back down.
Historically, about half of all soft landings on the Moon have succeeded.
This is true even in the modern era, in this century, which started with China's Chang'e-3 mission in 2013. It worked, but of the 10 attempts since, six ended in failure.

2024-02-21T03:22:54.000Z,Cerrado: Beef trade risks key Brazil ecosystem - campaigners,BBC News,"Beef production by three of the world's biggest meatpackers has been linked to illegal deforestation in Brazil's Cerrado, according to campaigners.
The savannah, which featured in Planet Earth III, hosts 5% of Earth's species and is a buffer against global warming.
In one part of the Cerrado, nearly half of the farms supplying the companies had cut down trees, the Global Witness investigation suggests.
The companies, JBS, Minerva and Marfrig said they acted in line with local law.
The Cerrado sits next to the Amazon but unlike its neighbouring habitat has not been afforded the same protections. An upcoming EU law to reduce the import of products from deforested land does not include much of the Cerrado, as it is not considered a forest under the legislation.
In the last year the rate of deforestation in the Amazon has halved whilst in the Cerrado it surged by 43% according to data from Brazilian space agency Inpe.
Simon Roach, senior investigative journalist from Global Witness, told the BBC: ""Everyone knows that the Amazon is in crisis and it rightly has had attention from lawmakers and the public, but next door you have this very important ecosystem that has not been protected to the same extent.""
The Cerrado savannah is described by Sir David Attenborough in the BBC documentary series Planet Earth III as a ""grassland paradise"". It covers nearly a fifth of Brazil's territory and hosts 5% of the world's species, including more than 6,000 types of tree.
It is also a vital store of planet-warming carbon - it is estimated it holds 13.7 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide, which is more than China released last year.
For decades it has suffered deforestation, as land is cleared for agriculture and mining. But a new investigation from international environmental and human rights charity Global Witness, and exclusively shared with the BBC, reveals the extent to which this Cerrado deforestation is illegal and is being driven by the cattle trade.
Although the Cerrado extends across 11 states the researchers focused their efforts on Mato Grosso - as it has the country's largest cattle herd and contains parts of both the Cerrado and the Amazon.
The three biggest meatpackers operating here are JBS, Minerva and Marfrig - who supply meat to the world and collectively turned over $98.15bn (£78.2bn) in 2022.
Each animal slaughtered by the meatpackers has a transfer permit detailing which farm in Mato Grosso they are brought from. The most recent permits available are from 2019.
The researchers looked at the permits and then used satellite data to see whether there had been deforestation at those farms over the preceding 11 years.
Global Witness estimate that between 2008 and 2019 an area of forest bigger than Chicago was felled within ranches supplying the three beef firms across Mato Grosso.
And for those farms based in the Cerrado 42% had suffered deforestation.
Deforestation is allowed under a state permit but Global Witness found permits covered only 1% of the land deforested, suggesting the majority was illegal.
Dr Viola Heinrich, a post doctoral researcher in climate science at Potsdam University, who was not involved in the study, said the figures may be higher. The researchers only counted deforestation that was bigger than or equal to 6.27 ha (15.5 acres) - as this is what the state will prosecute.
When asked about the findings Marfrig said that ""it does not acquire animals from deforested areas"" and that all of its supplies must meet the Brazilian Federal Prosecutor's deforestation rules.
JBS also made this point and said it had already removed 14% of the farms in Global Witness' analysis for non-compliance.
Minerva said there is no illegal deforestation in its supply chains.
Brazilian officials have said that tackling deforestation in the Cerrado is particularly difficult because regulation is set at the state level instead of being governed by national laws.
As well as releasing thousands of tonnes of carbon, deforestation threatens the habitats and lives of animals living in the Cerrado.
Last year the BBC's Planet Earth III team revealed the risk to the rare maned wolf from fires used for clearing the savannah for farming. The mother wolf, Norenia, and two of her puppies featured in the series were tragically found dead in a farmer's ditch following filming.
According to Brazilian government trade data, in 2019 most of the beef from Mato Grosso ended up in China, but beef from the state worth over $7.4m (£5.9m) went to the UK.
From the end of this year businesses will no longer be able to trade agricultural products in the EU which are linked to deforestation abroad, which includes the Amazon. But currently under the law's definition of ""forests"" much of the Cerrado is not included as the trees are not tall enough - leaving millions of trees exposed.
Dr Viola Heinrich told the BBC: ""The study's framing around EUDR [the law] is important. The results bring to light the need to carefully reconsider what is defined as deforestation under the EUDR and consider natural vegetation loss outside forested biomes.""
The EU Commission told the BBC that the EU regulation will still cover two thirds of the Cerrado and during its first review of the legislation will look at expanding what areas are included.
""This legislation will make little difference to deforestation in the Cerrado if it is left out,"" said Alice Thault, the executive-secretary of Instituto Centro de Vida, an environmental community organisation from Mato Grosso state.
The researchers were only able to get data on cattle up to 2019 because the transfer permits known as GTAs are no longer released publicly.
Mr Roach, from Global Witness, told the BBC: ""There has been a transparency issue in Brazil in recent years and it has become a lot trickier to get data.
""So, more transparency is needed if we want greater accountability around deforestation.""

2024-02-22T16:01:13.000Z,Antimatter: Scientists freeze positronium atoms with lasers,BBC News,"It's extremely rare and usually exists for just 142 billionths of a second.
Positronium can generate huge amounts of energy. It can shed light on 'antimatter' which existed at the beginning of the Universe, and studying it could revolutionise physics, cancer treatment, and maybe even space travel.
But until now the elusive substance has been almost impossible to analyse because its atoms move around so much.
Now scientists have a workaround - freezing it with lasers.
""Physicists are in love with positronium,"" said Dr Ruggero Caravita, who led the research at the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (Cern), near Geneva. ""It is the perfect atom to do experiments with antimatter.""
""Now the entire field of study is unblocked.""
So what exactly is positronium?
It is a so-called exotic atom consisting of both matter and antimatter - so very unusual stuff indeed.
Matter is what the world around us is made from, including the stars, the planets and us.
Antimatter is its opposite. It was created in equal amounts when the Universe was born but exists only fleetingly in nature now, with very little of it occurring naturally in the cosmos.
Discovering why there is now more matter in the Universe now than antimatter - and therefore why we exist - will take us a long way toward a new, more complete theory of how the Universe evolved, and positronium could be the key, according to Lisa Gloggler, a PhD student working on the project.
''Positronium is such a simple system. It consists 50% of matter and 50% of antimatter,""she said. ""We are hoping that if there is any difference between the two we can see it more easily than in more complex systems.""
One of the first experiments frozen positronium could be used for is to see if its antimatter part follows Einstein's Theory of General Relativity in the same way as the matter part.
The diagram below shows why positronium is so unique.
The matter, which forms the world around us, consists of atoms, the simplest of which is hydrogen, which is the most plentiful element in the Universe. This is made up of a positively-charged proton and a negatively-charged electron.
Positronium, on the other hand, consists of an electron and its antimatter equivalent, a positron.
It was first detected by scientists in the US in 1951. But it has been difficult to study because the atoms move around a lot because it is the lightest known atom.
But cooling it slows the atoms down, making it easier for scientists to study.
Up until now the coldest temperatures for positronium in a vacuum has been around 100C. The Cern team has now brought that down to more than -100C, using a technique called laser cooling. It is a difficult and intricate process where laser light is shone at the atoms to stop them jiggling about so much. The research has been published in the scientific journal Physical Review Letters.
For it to become usable for research positronium has to be frozen yet further, to around -260C, but the laser approach has given researchers a way forward, according to Prof Michael Charlton, an expert in positronium at Swansea University, who was not involved in the current breakthrough.
""This is a very encouraging first step, he told BBC News. ""It is opening the door so you can see the light on the other side, beckoning you to a new era of positronium physics.""
And the Cern group is not alone in their quest for frozen positronium. A group from the KEK Slow Positron Facility in Tokyo are about to publish similar results.
It is turning out to be a scientific race, involving other groups around the world as well, because this esoteric substance potentially has  enormous practical benefits. When an electron and positron combine, they release huge amounts of energy. This could be harnessed to create powerful, so called gamma ray lasers.
Some applications are medical imaging, cancer treatments, some even talk of it as a means of propelling spacecraft close to the speed of light, making interstellar travel feasible in the far future.
The work was carried out at Cern's antimatter factory, which has recently created and stored the largest amount of antimatter hydrogen atoms in the known Universe.
Last year a separate team of researchers tested whether antihydrogen responded differently to gravity by seeing if it fell up or down when dropped. They found that they fell downwards, but they do not yet know if they fall down at the same rate as normal hydrogen.

2024-02-28T05:52:35.000Z,Drax: UK power station still burning rare forest wood,BBC News,"A power company that has received £6bn in UK green subsidies has kept burning wood from some of the world's most precious forests, the BBC has found.
Papers obtained by Panorama show Drax took timber from rare forests in Canada it had claimed were ""no-go areas"".
It comes as the government decides whether to give the firm's Yorkshire site billions more in environmental subsidies funded by energy bill payers.
Drax says its wood pellets are ""sustainable and legally harvested"".
The Drax Power Station, near Selby in North Yorkshire, is a converted coal plant which burns wood pellets. In 2023, it produced about 5% of the UK's electricity. The site has become a key part of the government's drive to meet its climate targets.
Its owner, Drax, receives money from energy bill payers because the electricity produced from burning pellets is classified as renewable and treated as emission-free.
In fact, the power station emits about 12 million tonnes of carbon dioxide a year, but under international rules the UK doesn't have to count these emissions.
All of the 6.5 million tonnes of wood pellets burned by Drax each year are produced overseas. Many come from Drax's 17 pellet plants in the US and Canada.
In 2022, Panorama revealed the company had obtained logging licences in the Canadian province of British Columbia and filmed logs being taken from what the programme said was primary forest to a pellet plant owned by Drax.
Primary forests are natural forests that have not been significantly disturbed by human activity.
Following the BBC investigation, Drax denied taking wood from primary forests but said it would not apply for further logging licences in the province.
However, the company still takes whole logs from forests that have been cut down by timber companies.
Panorama has obtained documents from British Columbia's Ministry of Forests that show the company took more than 40,000 tonnes of wood from so-called ""old-growth"" forests in 2023.
Old-growth is some of the oldest forest which the provincial government says provides ""unique habitats, structures and ecological functions"".
One example is an 87-hectare (215-acre) ""cut block"" called EM807M - located 180 miles west of the logging city of Prince George - which was all classified as old growth. Although a timber company held the licence to cut down the site, logging records show that Drax took 26% of all the harvested wood.
In total, Drax received 130 lorry-loads of whole logs from the site last winter. The wood was turned into pellets and some were burned at its Yorkshire power plant.
Ninety per cent of the cut block had the even higher classification of ""priority deferral area"". This category is for old-growth forests that are ""rare, at risk and irreplaceable"", according to an independent panel of experts in British Columbia.
The experts recommended that logging should be paused in priority deferral areas, but it's still legal to cut them down. British Columbia's provincial government says it is working to ensure more old growth is deferred and protected.
Drax's use of timber from this ""irreplaceable"" forest was far from a one-off.
Forestry documents show that in the first nine months of last year the company took wood from 30 different timber marks in British Columbia where more than 25% of the forest had been designated as old growth. Twenty-six of those timber marks included the even rarer priority deferral areas.
Timber marks - codes beaten on to wood by specially made hammers - identify all of the wood cut under individual logging licences on one or more parcels of land. The timber mark paper trail meant Panorama could track logs to Drax's pellet mills.
In total, Drax sourced about 55,000 cubic metres of whole logs - that's more than 1,100 large truck loads - from timber marks containing old-growth forest.
Ecologist Michelle Connolly, from the British Columbia campaign group Conservation North, says making pellets from old forests can never be sustainable.
""Old-growth forests in British Columbia are almost gone because of 70 years of logging to feed sawmills and pulp mills, and Drax is helping push our remaining ones off the cliff, along with our native biodiversity,"" she says.
In response to the latest findings by the BBC, Drax admitted it has taken wood from old-growth forests. But it told Panorama that 77% of the material for its Canadian wood pellets came from sawdust and sawmill residues, with the rest coming from forestry residues and low-grade logs.
A spokesman for the company says that it keeps its sourcing policy and practices under regular review so that they ""take account of evolving forest dynamics, legislation, policy, and science"".
Drax says that it decided in October 2023 to stop sourcing wood from old-growth priority deferral areas, and that ""work to implement this decision through the supply chain is ongoing"".
The company doesn't dispute that it is still taking wood from old-growth sites that are not priority deferral areas.
The burning of wood from old-growth forests contradicts the company's previous claims. In a 2017 report about sustainability, Drax stated it would not take wood from what it called ""no-go areas"". It said: ""We do not take from protected forests, old growth or primary forest, sites that have been classified as having a high biodiversity value.""
Drax has told BBC Panorama that the 2017 document is ""now obsolete"" and that its current policy and practices are ""more sophisticated"".
The company's latest sourcing policy, published in 2019, makes no mention of protecting old growth or primary forest, instead it talks about avoiding ""damage or disturbance to high carbon forest"".
The UK subsidy scheme for Drax Power Station is due to end in 2027, but the government is consulting on plans to extend it to the end of the decade, which could cost bill-payers an additional £4bn.
The company says the emissions released by burning wood are offset by the planting of new trees. But critics say it takes decades for the new trees to grow and that the new forests may never be able to capture that much carbon dioxide.
Drax helps the UK government meet its climate targets because, on paper at least, the power station is treated as emission-free. This is because international carbon accounting rules state that greenhouse gas emissions from burning wood are counted in the country where the trees are felled as opposed to where they are burned.
Any additional subsidies would be to support Drax while it tries to install carbon capture technology to reduce emissions at its power station.
Previously, the government's scientific advisors on the Climate Change Committee - an independent non-departmental public body - warned that subsidies for burning wood pellets should not be extended beyond 2027.

2024-02-20T09:54:44.000Z,Brightest and hungriest black hole ever detected,BBC News,"The most luminous object ever detected has been spied in the distant Universe.
It's a quasar - the bright core of a galaxy that is powered by a gargantuan black hole some 17 billion times the mass of our Sun.
Known as J0529-4351, the object's power was confirmed in observations by the Very Large Telescope in Chile.
Scientists, reporting in the journal Nature Astronomy, say the black hole has a voracious appetite, consuming the mass equivalent to one Sun every day.
J0529-4351 was actually recorded in data many years ago but its true glory has only just been recognised.
""We have discovered an object which has previously not been recognised for what it is; it's been staring into our eyes for many years because it's been glowing at its brightness for longer than humankind has probably existed. But we've now recognised it, not as being one of the many foreground stars in our Milky Way but as a very distant object,"" Christian Wolf, from the Australian National University (ANU), told BBC News.
The term quasar is used by astronomers to describe a particular type of AGN, or Active Galactic Nucleus. It's the very energetic core of a galaxy which is being powered by an immense black hole that's pulling matter towards itself at a prodigious rate.
As this material is accelerated around the hole, it is torn apart and emits a huge amount of light, so much so that even an object as distant as J0529-4351 is still visible to us.
This quasar's emission has taken a staggering 12 billion years to reach the detectors at the VLT, a European Southern Observatory organisation.
Everything about the object is astonishing.
""What is unusual is the rate at which it's digesting other material; you know, swallowing mass. And that's at the rate of about one Sun - one solar mass - per day, which is an enormous rate. And that makes it very, very luminous,"" said Rachel Webster from the University of Melbourne.
The brightness is described as being equivalent to more than 500 trillion suns. The hot accretion disc producing all that light measures seven light-years in diameter. That's roughly 15,000 times the distance from the Sun to the orbit of Neptune.
All galaxies seem to have a supermassive object at their core, which probably means such objects are intrinsic to the evolution of those galaxies.
""In simple language, it means that without these black holes, our galaxy as we know it wouldn't be what it is today. In fact, all galaxies would be very different without their supermassive black holes. In fact, it may even be possible that all galaxies form around these supermassive black holes,"" ANU PhD student and co-author Samuel Lai said.
The puzzle is how some of the black holes got so big so early in the Universe. This is leading scientists to consider a scenario in which the objects grew directly out of the gas that existed just after the Big Bang, perhaps even before the first stars formed.

2024-01-11T19:08:48.000Z,Huge ancient lost city found in the Amazon,BBC News,"A huge ancient city has been found in the Amazon, hidden for thousands of years by lush vegetation.
The discovery changes what we know about the history of people living in the Amazon.
The houses and plazas in the Upano area in eastern Ecuador were connected by an astounding network of roads and canals.
The area lies in the shadow of a volcano that created rich local soils but also may have led to the destruction of the society.
While we knew about cities in the highlands of South America, like Machu Picchu in Peru, it was believed that people only lived nomadically or in tiny settlements in the Amazon.
""This is older than any other site we know in the Amazon. We have a Eurocentric view of civilisation, but this shows we have to change our idea about what is culture and civilisation,"" says Prof Stephen Rostain, director of investigation at the National Centre for Scientific Research in France, who led the research.
""It changes the way we see Amazonian cultures. Most people picture small groups, probably naked, living in huts and clearing land - this shows ancient people lived in complicated urban societies,"" says co-author Antoine Dorison.
The city was built around 2,500 years ago, and people lived there for up to 1,000 years, according to archaeologists.
It is difficult to accurately estimate how many people lived there at any one time, but scientists say it is certainly in the 10,000s if not 100,000s.
The archaeologists combined ground excavations with a survey of a 300 sq km (116 sq mile) area using laser sensors flown on a plane that could identify remains of the city beneath the dense plants and trees.
This LiDAR technology found 6,000 rectangular platforms measuring about 20m (66 ft) by 10m (33 ft) and 2-3m high.
They were arranged in groups of three to six units around a plaza with a central platform.
The scientists believe many were homes, but some were for ceremonial purposes. One complex, at Kilamope, included a 140m (459 ft) by 40m (131 ft) platform.
They were built by cutting into hills and creating a platform of earth on top.
A network of straight roads and paths connected many of the platforms, including one that extended 25km (16 miles).
Dr Dorison said these roads were the most striking part of the research.
""The road network is very sophisticated. It extends over a vast distance, everything is connected. And there are right angles, which is very impressive,"" he says, explaining that it is much harder to build a straight road than one that fits in with the landscape.
He believes some had a ""very powerful meaning"", perhaps linked to a ceremony or belief.
The scientists also identified causeways with ditches on either side which they believe were canals that helped manage the abundant water in the region.
There were signs of threats to the cities - some ditches blocked entrances to the settlements, and may be evidence of threats from nearby people.
Researchers first found evidence of a city in the 1970s, but this is the first time a comprehensive survey has been completed, after 25 years of research.
It reveals a large, complex society that appears to be even bigger than the well-known Mayan societies in Mexico and Central America.
""Imagine that you discovered another civilisation like the Maya, but with completely different architecture, land use, ceramics,"" says José Iriarte, a professor of archaeology at University of Exeter, who was not involved in this research.
Some of the findings are ""unique"" for South America, he explains, pointing to the octagonal and rectangular platforms arranged together.
The societies were clearly well-organised and interconnected, he says, highlighting the long sunken roads between settlements.
Not a huge amount is known about the people who lived there and what their societies were like.
Pits and hearths were found in the platforms, as well as jars, stones to grind plants and burnt seeds.
The Kilamope and Upano people living there probably mostly focussed on agriculture. People ate maize and sweet potato, and probably drank ""chicha"", a type of sweet beer.
Prof Rostain says he was warned against this research at the start of his career because scientists believed no ancient groups had lived in the Amazon.
""But I'm very stubborn, so I did it anyway. Now I must admit I am quite happy to have made such a big discovery,"" he says.
The next step for the researchers is understanding what lies in an adjoining 300 sq km (116 sq mile) area not yet surveyed.

2024-03-12T02:12:25.000Z,"Banana prices to go up as temperatures rise, says expert",BBC News,"Bananas are set to get more expensive as climate change hits a much-loved fruit, one of the world's top experts from the industry tells BBC News.
Pascal Liu, senior economist at the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation, says climate impacts pose an ""enormous threat"" to supply, compounding the impacts of fast-spreading diseases.
The World Banana Forum meets in Rome on Tuesday to discuss the challenges.
Some UK shops recently experienced banana shortages due to sea storms.
In its natural yellow wrapper, the nutritious and tasty banana is the world's most exported fruit.
The UK alone imports around 5 billion bananas ever year, with around 90% sold through the major supermarkets.
Last week saw shortages of bananas in several UK supermarkets, which retailers said were down to storms at sea, delaying supplies.
Most consumers won't have noticed, according to Prof Dan Bebber from the University of Exeter, who has studied efforts to make bananas more sustainable.
""The supply chain fluctuates but the UK is actually quite good at buffering those types of effects,"" he told BBC News.
""Mainly, because the ripening centres can accelerate or decelerate the rate at which they ripen the bananas when they arrive, which helps to buffer those types of fluctuations.""
But while banana supplies can cope with short-term weather events like this, experts are concerned about the growing threats from a warming world, and from the diseases that are spreading in its wake.
""I think climate change is really an enormous threat to the banana sector,"" said Mr Liu of the World Banana Forum, a UN umbrella group that brings together industry stakeholders including retailers, producer countries, exporters and research institutions.
As well as severe weather impacting production, bananas are sensitive to temperature rises which could wipe out crops in some locations.
Perhaps the biggest immediate threat is the fact that rising temperatures are helping to spread disease.
The one causing the most worry is Fusarium Wilt TR4, a fungal infection, which has moved from Australia and Asia to Africa and now to South America.
Once a plantation is infected, it kills all the banana trees and experts say it is extremely hard to get rid of.
The fungus has also mutated to threaten the Cavendish, the world's favourite banana variety.
""We know that the spores of this Fusarium Wilt are extremely resistant, and they can be spread by flooding, they can be spread by strong winds,"" said Mr Liu.
""So, this type of phenomenon will disseminate the disease much faster than if you had more normal weather patterns.""
Producers are also facing pressures from rising costs of fertilisers, energy and transport as well as problems in finding enough workers.
Taken together with the impacts of climate change on supply, prices in the UK and elsewhere are likely to go up - and stay up.
""There will be some price increases, indeed,"" said Mr Liu. ""If there's not a major increase in supply, I project that banana prices will remain relatively high in the coming years.""
Among the issues that the banana industry will discuss at its gathering in Rome is the critical question of sustainability.
Consumers are increasingly looking to buy bananas and other commodities that are produced in a sustainable way.
For banana growers this means not only making their means of production greener, but also paying independent examiners to certify that their fruit are sustainable.
""These regulations are a good thing in a way because they help producers seize the opportunity of making their production systems more sustainable,"" said Mr Liu.
""But of course, they also come with costs for producers because they require more control and monitoring systems on the part of the producers and the traders. And these costs have to trickle down to the final consumers.""

2024-01-24T17:37:35.000Z,Amazon's record drought driven by climate change,BBC News,"One of our planet's most vital defences against global warming is itself being ravaged by climate change.
It was the main driver of the Amazon rainforest's worst drought in at least half a century, according to a new study.
Often described as the ""lungs of the planet"", the Amazon plays a key role in removing warming carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
But rapid deforestation has left it more vulnerable to weather extremes.
While droughts in the Amazon are not uncommon, last year's event was ""exceptional"", the researchers say.
In October, the Rio Negro - one of the world's largest rivers - reached its lowest recorded level near Manaus in Brazil, surpassing marks going back over 100 years.
As well as being a buffer against climate change, the Amazon is a rich source of biodiversity, containing around 10% of the world's species - with many more yet to be discovered.
The drought has disrupted ecosystems and has directly impacted millions of people who rely on rivers for transport, food and income, with the most vulnerable hit hardest.
One trigger for these dry conditions is El Niño - a natural weather system where sea surface temperatures increase in the East Pacific Ocean. This affects global rainfall patterns, particularly in South America.
But human-caused climate change was the main driver of the extreme drought, according to the World Weather Attribution group, reducing the amount of water in the soil in two main ways.
Firstly, the Amazon is typically receiving less rainfall than it used to between June and November - the drier part of the year - as the climate warms.
Secondly, hotter temperatures mean there's more evaporation from the plants and soils, so they lose more water.
The researchers used weather data and computer simulations to compare drought conditions in two scenarios: one with human-caused warming, and one without.
In a world where humans hadn't heated up the planet by around 1.2C, such an intense 'agricultural drought' - where a lack of rainfall and high evaporation dry out the soils - may only have happened around once every 1,500 years, the study suggests.
Climate change has made a drought of this severity around 30 times more likely, according to the researchers, and one is now expected to happen every 50 years under current conditions.
""This really is something quite exceptional,"" says Dr Ben Clarke, a researcher with the World Weather Attribution group.
As the map below shows, drought hit almost all of the Amazon basin. This scale - and intensity - makes it different to previous droughts, Dr Clarke told BBC News.
And if warming continues, such extreme droughts could become even more common.
""If we continue burning oil, gas and coal, very soon, we'll reach 2C of warming and we'll see similar Amazon droughts about once every 13 years,"" says Dr Friederike Otto, a senior lecturer in climate science at Imperial College London.
More frequent and intense droughts test the Amazon's resilience. That has already been stretched by deforestation - around one-fifth of the rainforest has been lost over the last 50 years.
Trees help the area retain and release moisture, fuelling their own clouds, and they also help to cool temperatures.
While the effect of deforestation was not directly tested in this latest study, previous research has shown it increases the vulnerability of the rainforest to drought.
The world's largest rainforest is seen as crucial in the battle to limit global warming.
""The Amazon could make or break our fight against climate change,"" says Regina Rodrigues, a professor of physical oceanography and climate at the Federal University of Santa Catarina in Brazil.
In a healthy state, it takes up more carbon dioxide (CO2) than it releases.
This limits CO2 increases in the atmosphere from human activities, keeping a lid on temperatures.
But there is evidence that this may be changing, as trees die back due to drought, wildfires and deliberate clearance to make room for agriculture.
There is concern that if climate change and deforestation continue at their current pace, the Amazon could soon reach a ""tipping point"".
If crossed, this could lead to the rapid and irreversible dieback of the whole rainforest - potentially leading to the region becoming a significant source of CO2 emissions.
It's not known exactly where such a threshold might sit.
""I don't think that [tipping point] is what we are seeing [yet], at least in all but the driest part of the Amazon forest,"" says Yadvinder Malhi, a professor of ecosystem science at the University of Oxford, who was not involved in the latest study.
Despite the latest record drought, there has been some encouraging progress.
The rate of deforestation fell in 2023 compared with the year before, according to the Brazilian space agency, with President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva pledging to halt it completely by 2030.
This - alongside urgent action to slash the greenhouse gas emissions that are fuelling global warming - can still help to protect what's left of the Amazon, researchers say.
""The loss of the Amazon forest is far from inevitable in the short-term,"" as long as fire and deforestation can be controlled, Prof Malhi told BBC News.
""But we do need to get to grips with stabilising global climate, as the risk increases with every fraction of a degree the planet warms.""

2024-01-17T01:21:43.000Z,"Flood defence policy flawed, say MPs",BBC News,"The government must do more to protect homes in England from flooding, according to a cross-party committee of MPs.
A report by the Public Accounts Committee said the government hadn't maintained enough of its existing flood defences or built enough new ones.
Scientists say climate change makes heavy rainfall and floods more likely.
The government said it would consider the committee's findings and had spent £6bn protecting homes since 2010.
In 2020 the government committed to better protecting 336,000 more properties between 2021 and 2027.
But a report by the National Audit Office (NAO) in November said this was reduced to 200,000, a cut of 40%, with inflation cited as the major reason.
The Public Accounts Committee said in its report that the reduced number was also due to delays and bureaucracy.
It also said that some existing flood defences have not been properly looked after. The MPs say a £34m shortfall in funding for the Environment Agency to maintain defences had meant that only 94% of its assets were properly maintained. As a result 203,000 English homes are actually at an increased risk of flooding, according to the MPs.
They noted that money saved from the slow progress of the new flood defence projects could have been spent on maintaining existing infrastructure.
""This inquiry has uncovered the alarming truth that in a number of ways, the approach to keeping our citizens safe in this area is contradictory and self-defeating,"" said Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, a Conservative MP and deputy chair of the Public Accounts Committee.
According to official figures 5.7 million homes in England are at risk from some sort of flooding. This winter more than 2,000 across the UK were flooded after a series of storms brought heavy rain.
""Since 2010, we have invested over £6bn to better protect over 600,000 properties from flooding and coastal erosion"" a spokesperson for the Department of Environment Food and Rural Affairs said.
""Thanks to this significant investment, 381,000 homes have been protected since 2015, with over 102,000 protected during Storm Henk.""
The MPs noted that housing developments continue to be built on flood plains saying it was ""unforgivable"" when it was happening without mitigation. Though the government's stated ambition is to create a nation more resilient to flooding the report said it had not defined what this actually means, so there was no way to measure whether it's achieving that or not.
""The reality is we also have to look at is how do we ensure we can live with climate change. How can we live with flooding?"" Conservative MP and committee member Anne Marie Morris told BBC News. ""And that's a question which isn't being asked, and it must absolutely not only be asked, but be answered.""

2024-01-18T19:04:50.000Z,Bee-harming neonicotinoid pesticide has emergency approval again,BBC News,"The UK government has given emergency approval for the use of a pesticide banned because of the harm it can cause bees, for the fourth year in a row.
Permission to use the neonicotinoid on sugar beet seeds has been needed despite a vow by the industry to find an alternative by the end of 2023.
The Wildlife Trusts said the decision was a ""deathblow"" for wildlife.
The government said it was a ""necessary and proportionate measure"" to tackle a damaging crop virus spread by aphids.
It added that the product - which has been banned since 2018 - can only be used if an independent, scientifically-verified level of threat posed by the disease, Virus Yellows, is met in March.
That threshold will be a 65% infection across the national sugar beet crop.
The NFU said the Virus Yellows disease had already caused sugar beet crop losses of up to 80% in recent years and threatened an industry with more than 9,500 jobs.
Sugar-beet farmer Michael Sly, who has land across north Cambridgeshire and south Lincolnshire and is the chair of the NFU's sugar board, said he was ""relieved"" the derogation had been granted.
He said farmers would ""ensure safe and responsible use of the treatment"" if the pesticide had to be used.
""The homegrown sugar industry is working hard to find viable, long-term solutions to this disease,"" he added.
Environmental and wildlife campaigners warned that the neonicotinoid - a seed treatment called thiamethoxam - disrupts bees' ability to navigate and reproduce.
Barnaby Coupe, land use policy manager at The Wildlife Trusts, said the decision to authorise its use was ""a deathblow for wildlife, a backwards step in evidence-based decision making, and a betrayal of farmers who are producing food sustainably"".
Richard Benwell, CEO of Wildlife and Countryside Link, a coalition of environmental and rural campaign groups, said the decision ""flies in the face of ecological sense"".
Back in 2020, British Sugar - which supplies 60% of the UK's sugar - had told the government that in three years it would have developed alternatives to the seed treatment.
Dan Green, the company's agriculture director, told the BBC that research was continuing and included ""research into how the industry can benefit from gene editing"".
The company hopes Virus Yellows resistant crops will be available commercially by 2026.
Farming Minister Mark Spencer said his decision had been based on robust scientific assessment with the risk evaluated ""very carefully"".
""We recognise the damaging impact that an outbreak of beet yellow virus could have on farmer livelihoods. We therefore regard issuing an emergency authorisation as a necessary and proportionate measure,"" he added.

2024-02-12T08:46:16.000Z,"Migrating species crucial to planet under threat, says UN",BBC News,"The world's most vulnerable migratory species face an increasing risk of extinction, a landmark UN report warns.
From turtle doves to green turtles, from the European eel to the African penguin, migratory species are the great explorers of the animal kingdom.
They play an essential role in protecting the Earth's habitats by transferring nutrients, pollinating and maintaining woodlands.
But decades of exploitation has left ""species on the edge of extinction"".
More than 40 years ago, many of the world's nations signed an agreement to protect the world's migrating species, known as the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS).
Now, a first global assessment has been undertaken looking at the numbers and health of these animals.
Of the 1,189 species assessed, the researchers found one in five are threatened with extinction. For some species the situation is much worse - 97% of fish listed under the convention are at risk.
Amy Fraenkel, the UN Executive Secretary to the convention, told the BBC: ""There has been a lack of attention for migratory species and if we don't succeed in turning this around, we will see extinction. There are species that are already on the edge"".
The report's overwhelming conclusion is that the decline is driven by human activity - excessive hunting and killing of animals, habitat destruction, climate change and the expansion of towns and cities bringing noise and light pollution.
Dr Rob Cooke, an ecological modeller at the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, said the report shows: ""Migratory species face a cocktail of threats because they are moving through different habitats"".
Ms Fraenkel said although countries signed the convention four decades ago, ""clearly some of these findings show there is illegal killing going on and lack of upholding the law"".
She said there has been a lot of work done to prevent the illegal trading of animals but less focus on animals that are killed for sport, leisure and food, and never traded.
It is estimated that between 11 and 36 million birds are illegally killed or taken annually in the Mediterranean region, with a further few million estimated to be illegally killed or taken in the Arabian Peninsula, Iran and Iraq.
Kelly Malsch, lead author of the report and head of UNEP-WCMC's Species Programme, said it is also the very nature of migration that makes it challenging to protect these animals. Some, like the Monarch Butterfly, will travel thousands of miles over a dozen country borders.
She told the BBC: ""Whether it is birds, or animals on land, or those swimming in our oceans, they are interacting with different country regulations which highlights the need for consistent approaches.""
The report recommends that:
By mapping migration corridors, it is hoped that animals can be protected from human activities. One of the biggest threats facing sharks and rays is being incidentally fished as bycatch. Satellite imagery has previously revealed that there is extensive overlap between the areas used by migrating sharks and those frequented by global fishing fleets.
Inger Andersen, executive director of the UN Environment Programme, said she remains optimistic. ""There is hope,"" she added.
Some species have seen their populations climb thanks to conservation efforts. The South Atlantic population of Humpback Whales numbered just 450 in the mid-1950s after being extensively hunted. Following the introduction of protections, there are now estimated to be more than 25,000.
Dr Cooke welcomed the report but said there were still thousands of migratory species, particularly insects, not currently assessed. Only one insect is listed under the CMS.
""This is a clear area to improve on,"" he said.
Insect populations are difficult to measure - their small frames means they cannot wear trackers, and some, like dragonflies, cannot be easily seen as they do not swarm like birds.
On Sunday, government officials began gathering in Uzbekistan to develop a coordinated plan in response to this research.

2024-02-03T00:03:59.000Z,Antarctica mysteries to be mapped by robot plane,BBC News,"A team of scientists and engineers have landed in Antarctica to test a drone that will help experts forecast the impacts of climate change.
The autonomous plane will map areas of the continent that have been out of bounds to researchers.
It has been put to the test in extreme weather around Wales' highest peaks.
Its first experiment will survey the mountains under an ice sheet to predict how quickly the ice could melt and feed into global sea-level rise.
Scientists want to understand Antarctica better but they are limited by the existing technology.
Strong winds, below-freezing temperatures and sudden storms are common. These dangerous conditions, as well as dark winters and the need to transport pilots and large amounts of fuel, put limitations on use of traditional crewed planes.
The British Antarctic Survey developed the new drone with UK company Windracers to be easily repaired if something goes wrong.
The drone was tested in Llanbedr, Eryri (also called Snowdonia) in north Wales - a stand-in for the difficult weather and terrain of Antarctica.
During a practice run in strong winds with rain lashing the airfield, engineer Rebecca Toomey explained that the drone can fly to remote areas without concerns for pilots' safety.
It can carry 220lb (100kg) of cargo up to 620 miles (1,000km). Instruments including radar and cameras are loaded in the back of the drone and on its wings. Its route is programmed in and an engineer monitors the flight from a computer.
Rebecca will operate the drone from Rothera base in Antarctica, but eventually the British Antarctic Survey hope to fly it from the UK.
It also uses much less fuel than traditional planes - 10 barrels compared to 200 on one research flight - reducing the environmental impact of scientific research on the planet.
The data it collects will be processed at the British Antarctic Survey headquarters in Cambridge.
Scientist Tom Jordan explains that some of it will feed into a model of the continent called BEDMAP2 that shows the complex shape of the land under the ice.
Drawing a question mark over parts of the map, he explains that large areas of Antarctica are still unmapped because no-one has ever been able to get there.
""You can see the mountain ridge under the ice here and here. Does that continue across? Are parts under sea level? I don't know,"" he says.
""This survey work is really exciting because it's a proper blank in the map.""
Antarctica's vast ice covers huge mountains ranges - some the size of the European Alps - and trenches and valleys. Some areas are below sea level.
It is vital that scientists understand this topography because it determines how quickly the ice will melt.
An ice sheet exposed to warming waters will probably melt more quickly. But if complex mountains block its path, it will decline slower, Tom says.
In its first experiment, radar on the drone will fire radio waves at an ice sheet called Fuchs Piedmont. Some will go into the ice sheet, hit the ground at the base and bounce back. The drone will listen for those reflections and use them to draw the shape of the land.
""It builds up this picture -  going line by line. This is another thing that drones are great for - doing things that are really boring,"" he explains.
Current models of global sea-level rise from melting ice sheets have wide margins, but with a better understanding of Antarctica's topography, Tom says scientists can make more accurate predictions.
""That will help us plan the future,"" he says.
The first flights will be in the next few weeks. Other experiments include surveys of marine life like krill, which are a vital part of the food chain, and surveys of environmentally sensitive areas.

2024-02-23T10:43:57.000Z,Pamela Salem: James Bond and Doctor Who star dies aged 80,BBC News,"Pamela Salem, who is best known for appearing in James Bond film Never Say Never Again, has died aged 80.
She played the secretary Miss Moneypenny in the unofficial 007 film, starring alongside Sean Connery.
Salem also appeared opposite Connery in the 1978 crime film The First Great Train Robbery.
Her other roles include playing Professor Rachel Jensen in BBC sci-fi series Doctor Who in the 1980s.
Never Say Never Again was one of two James Bond films not to be produced by Eon Productions, the usual producer, and therefore not considered part of the official franchise.
It was produced by Warner Bros and made possible because screenwriter Kevin McClory had retained the filming rights of the novel following a long legal battle.
Salem, who was born in India in 1944, came to London to study at the Central School of Speech and Drama and first started at repertory theatre in Chesterfield and York.
Salem went on to appear in medical drama ER and science fiction shows Blake's 7, The Tripods and Into The Labyrinth.
She also appeared in US drama series The West Wing, where she played the fictional UK prime minister Maureen Graty, and in Eastenders as mafia member Joanne Francis.
Salem was part of the Doctor Who franchise alongside Sylvester McCoy, the seventh actor to play the doctor, and was also part of the radio spin-off series Counter Measures.
In 2020, Salem returned to a reboot of Doctor Who show The Robots of Death called The Robots, which was an audio drama series.
Salem moved to Los Angeles in the 1990s, then Miami.
Salem died on Wednesday, according to Big Finish Productions.
David Richardson, a Doctor Who audio drama producer, said: ""Pamela Salem was lovely, and we all loved her.
""Whenever there was a Big Finish recording for her, she'd fly in from Miami on her own steam, without fuss or fanfare, and appear at the studio armed with the warmest smiles, the biggest hugs and often presents.
""She was a very gentle person, always interested in everyone from her co-stars to the production team to the guest actors and visitors.""
Actor Karen Gledhill, who worked alongside Salem in Counter-Measures, said: ""Pamela was the kindest, most generous actor I have ever worked with.
""Back in the 80s on Remembrance Of The Daleks (my first proper TV job), she took me under her wing and led me through a wonderful but slightly daunting experience. We became friends, and whenever we met were always so pleased to see each other.""
She also said they ""shared a mutual love of dogs - she adored the canine friends that she often rescued and looked after"".
""She was so loved, so respected and will be so missed,"" Gledhill added

2024-02-21T12:28:05.000Z,Diddy: Sean Combs denies rape allegation in court papers,BBC News,"Sean Combs has filed his first official response to claims he raped a 17-year-old girl in a recording studio in 2003.
The rapper was sued in December by an unnamed woman, who said the star and two other men plied her with ""copious amounts of drugs and alcohol"" before taking turns raping her in a bathroom.
In court papers filed on Tuesday, Combs denied the accusations and questioned the timing of the lawsuit.
He also questioned the legitimacy of photographs included in the lawsuit.
Combs ""never participated in, witnessed, or was or is presently aware of any misconduct, sexual or otherwise, relating to plaintiff in any circumstance whatsoever,"" his lawyers said in a response filed in the Southern District of New York.
They also argued that the two-decade gap between the alleged assault and the court case had ""prejudiced"" the case against Combs, ""as he has lost the ability to defend himself fully and fairly in this action"".
""For example, some or all evidence that otherwise would have been available if the action had been promptly commenced may be unavailable, lost, or compromised,"" they said.
In the original lawsuit, a woman identified as Jane Doe said she was approached by Combs' longtime business partner Pierre Harve in 2003, who told her he was ""best friends"" with the music mogul.
After speaking to Combs on the phone, she was convinced to board a private jet to New York, where she was taken to his Daddy's House Recording Studio.
She alleges that Combs, Harve and an unnamed third man encouraged her to become inebriated, after which she was ""viciously"" raped by all three men, while ""coming in and out of consciousness"".
""She could not possibly have consented to having sex with anyone, much less someone twice her age,"" her lawyers said, adding that the assault had resulted in ""significant emotional distress and feel[ing]s of shame that have plagued her life and personal relationships for 20 years"".
The complaint also included photos of the woman, purportedly taken at the studio that night, including one where she is pictured sitting on Combs' lap.
Pierre filed his own response to the lawsuit on Tuesday, saying he ""never participated in the sexual assault of the plaintiff nor did he ever witness anyone else sexually assaulting the plaintiff"".
In addition, Combs' lawyers argued that the lawsuit should be thrown out because the Victims of Gender-Motivated Violence Act, under which he is being sued, is ""unconstitutional"".
An amendment to the act, passed in 2022, temporarily lifted the statute of limitations on gender-based violence cases - meaning victims of historical sexual abuse had a two-year window to sue their attackers, even if it had been decades since the assault.
""Allowing this action to proceed violates defendant's rights under the US Constitution and the New York State Constitution,"" Combs' legal team said.
The legal case was the fourth such action against Combs filed last year.
The star's ex-girlfriend Cassandra ""Cassie"" Ventura sued him in November, alleging the record label executive alleged raped her in 2018 and subjected her to years of sexual and physical abuse.
The musicians settled the lawsuit two days later.""I have decided to resolve this matter amicably on terms that I have some level of control,"" said Ventura in a statement.
Two more accusers filed lawsuits against Combs the following week. One alleged Combs drugged and sexually assaulted her and then showed video of the assault to others.
The other woman alleged Combs and another man took turns raping her and her friend in the early 1990s.
Combs later issued a statement denying all the allegations against him.
""Enough is enough. For the last couple of weeks, I have sat silently and watched people try to assassinate my character, destroy my reputation and my legacy,"" he said.
""Sickening allegations have been made against me by individuals looking for a quick payday. Let me be absolutely clear: I did not do any of the awful things being alleged. I will fight for my name, my family and for the truth,"" he continued.
The musician shot to fame under the name Puff Daddy, writing producing hits for acts like Notorious B.I.G, Faith Evans and Mary J Blige.
He launched a solo career after Notorious B.I.G.'s murder in 1997, scoring a worldwide number one with the tribute song I'll Be Missing You.
The 54-year-old has kept a low profile since the allegations of sexual assault emerged last year. He stepped down as chairman of his media company, Revolt, and parted ways with drinks company Diageo, with whom he marketed the ""premium"" vodka brand, Ciroc.
The star was also absent from the Grammy Awards earlier this month, where his latest record - The Love Album: Off The Grid - was nominated for best progressive R&B album

The actor was famous for his booming voice while playing the local butcher on the ITV soap.
His co-star Sue Nicholls, who played love interest Audrey Roberts, said she was ""very sad"" to hear of his death.
""My memories of working with you dear John on the street are a joy, and always will be,"" she added.
""God bless you and thank you for being in my life. Much love to you and your friends and family.""
Savident joined the Manchester-based soap in 1994, and quickly became a favourite with viewers thanks to his huge personality and loud voice.
His storylines involved his disastrous love life, including three marriages and several failed proposals.
A secret son, Ashley Peacock (played by Steven Arnold), also arrived on the show and the two later developed a close bond as they worked as butchers together.
Savident's character was killed off in 2006, suffering a stroke on the day he was supposed to marry Bev Unwin (Susie Blake).
Elliott's death also saw Roberts, his former romantic interest, confess she still loved him following her turning down his proposal of marriage years previously.
The butcher's other previous wives were Maureen Holdsworth (Sherrie Hewson) and barmaid Eve Sykes (Melanie Kilburn).
One of Elliott's most distinctive character traits was that he often said things twice, usually inserting the words ""I say"" between them - for example: ""Best of British is that, I say best of British.""
Shortly before the character died, Elliott said to Audrey Roberts: ""Be happy, I say, be happy.""
Iain MacLeod, ITV's executive producer for continuing drama, said: ""Everyone at Coronation Street is deeply saddened to learn of John Savident's death.
""As Fred Elliott, John firmly established himself in the pantheon of Coronation Street greats.
""His peerless comic timing, combined with a deep pathos arising from his outstanding dramatic skill, made Fred an unforgettable, iconic character that provided great joy to viewers for many years.""
Outside Coronation Street, Savident's other screen credits included a role in political comedy Yes, Minister.
He was cast in Doctor Who, Stanley Kubrick's dystopian thriller A Clockwork Orange, biopic Gandhi, war film Battle Of Britain, and period drama Middlemarch.
Savident also appeared opposite Sir Anthony Hopkins in 1993's Oscar-nominated The Remains Of The Day.
He was in the first staging of the musical Phantom Of The Opera, in October 1986 in the West End, as the opera house owner Monsieur Firmin.
After leaving his soap work, Savident appeared on stage in productions of panto Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs and Harold Brighouse's Hobson's Choice.
Born in Guernsey in 1938 to a local fisherman father and a Swiss mother, Savident and his family left the Channel Islands, then under German occupation, and moved to Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester, when he was three.
He started his career as a policeman in Manchester and during his six years of service was stabbed in the arm as he tried to break up a gang fight.
Initially pursuing his acting ambitions in amateur productions, Savident quit the force when a producer overheard him talking in a pub and offered him a part as Robin Hood in a London panto, launching his acting career.
Savident was married to theatre director Rona Hopkinson and they had two children.
Broadcaster Tom Hourigan said Savident delivered ""arguably one of the most distinctive characters - and deliveries - in British soap history"".
Actor Stuart Antony shared a picture of himself with Savident, describing him as ""always lovely and witty"".
A statement from Savident's agent announcing his death to the PA news agency said: ""He was a much-loved husband and father of two and will be sorely missed by all who knew him.""

2024-03-05T14:40:12.000Z,Talk TV: Rupert Murdoch network to be taken off air and moved online,BBC News,"Rupert Murdoch's Talk TV network is to cease broadcasting as a traditional television channel in the summer and move solely online.
The network launched in 2022 but has struggled to attract viewers on its linear platform.
In contrast, many videos clipped up from its shows perform well on YouTube.
It comes a month after its star presenter, Piers Morgan, also saw his show moved from its terrestrial weekday evening slot to being solely online.
Scott Taunton, Talk TV's president of broadcasting, said in a briefing to staff: ""Two years ago, we would not have been brave enough to launch a channel without a linear presence.
""But audiences of all ages have moved fast and smartphones are now the primary device where news is consumed. We need to adapt to this as a priority.""
He added: ""We are therefore intending that Talk comes off linear television from early summer and our focus will be on streaming.""
Taunton said clips would continue to be shared through social media, while the company hoped to grow the number of viewers who watched the service via live streaming on televisions.
He said there was ""no doubt"" over the channel's future, adding: ""It just won't be distributed on linear.""
Piers Morgan Uncensored currently has 2.4 million YouTube subscribers, while the channel as a whole has 812,000.
TalkTV, a venture from News UK, the publisher of The Times and The Sun, launched in 2022.
Last month, Morgan said his show was leaving television to focus on the Uncensored YouTube channel, saying that daily, fixed TV schedules have been ""an increasingly unnecessary straitjacket"".
Announcing the news, Taunton reassured employees it was ""business as usual"" despite the changes but did add that there would be a ""restructure.""
Over the next few months, the company plans to create a new division, called News Studios, to produce bite-size content for brands such as talkSPORT, the Sun, the Times, the Sunday Times and Virgin Radio.
""Because we are proposing to create News Studios and change Talk's priorities, we are proposing that there is a restructure so that we can focus our resources and talent on the output we will be creating.""
In the briefing, Taunton also acknowledged: ""Linear channel slots cost us millions a year and the advertising revenues are never going to materially exceed the cost of being in these distribution slots.""
Murdoch had hoped the network would shake up the broadcasting establishment by offering an opinion-led alternative to the BBC.
Its launch followed that of GB News a year earlier.

Titled Slut Pop Miami, it's an outrageous, sex-positive, club-ready tribute to the joys of carnal pleasure.
Released on Valentines' Day, it was inspired by ""hedonistic trips to Miami"" and joins a lineage of explicit, transgressive pop, from Madonna's Erotica to Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion's WAP.
""Stirring up the culture and raising eyebrows has been in the DNA of pop forever,"" Petras tells the BBC.
The EP is the German-born star's third release since last June, following her debut album Feed The Beast and Problématique, a surprise release of an earlier, scrapped project.
This flurry of activity followed her appearance on Sam Smith's global chart-topper Unholy - which made Petras the first openly transgender artist to have a US number one and the first trans artist to win a major category Grammy.
Her mainstream breakout followed years of hard graft. Petras started uploading cover songs to MySpace in 2007, and later gambled on a move to Los Angeles in the hope of becoming a pop star.
""I played every gay club in America, I danced on every single bar and I built my following from the ground up,"" she says.
""I didn't have my breakthrough until Unholy but, to get to that stage, I had to release multiple songs as an independent artist and prove to record labels that there's a fanbase out there for me.""
That determination paid off. Now signed to Republic Records (home to Taylor Swift and Ariana Grande), she's in the middle of a sold-out, 40-date world tour.
On a rare day off, Petras called the BBC to reflect on her career to date.
Hey Kim! Are we interrupting your vocal rest?
Not today, I have a bunch of things lined up. But usually, between shows, I just shut up for two whole days. It's the only thing that works for singers who actually sing.
Ah yes, you have a policy of never miming. How come?
I just feel ripped off if I go to a show and the artist isn't singing.
When you sing live, it makes the show different every night. Your performance reflects the energy of the crowd. If they're into it, you're going to hit all the high notes and do all the crazy runs. And knowing that gives the fans motivation to go crazy as well.
It helps that you have a really strong voice...
Well, I've always been really loud! I used to get in trouble with my neighbours because I love diva singers like Freddie Mercury or Cher, so it felt right for me to sing big.
How did you train yourself to emulate Cher?
Well, at first, you blow out your voice a bunch, until you realise you're screaming and doing it wrong. I used to sing from my throat a lot - for us Germans the ""R"" sounds are in our throats. Then you adjust and learn to sing from your body, not your throat.
But thank God, I had a voice to work with in the beginning. My parents taught me a lot, too. My dad's an architect, but he plays eight instruments and was always off to band rehearsals. And my mum was really into jazz, so there was a lot of Billie Holiday in the house.
It's nice to hear that. So many interviews about your childhood focus on your gender transition, but music was always important?
Absolutely. I was always singing. Music was my happy place and honestly very helpful in my transition. I went through that stuff very early [Petras completed gender reassignment surgery at 16] and music allowed me to sing and twirl and forget about how the world reacted to me.
Once I started learning how to write, it immediately became my job. I figured, OK, you live in the middle of nowhere, no-one's going to write songs for you, so you'd better learn to do it yourself.
I wanted to be like an Indiana Jones of music and find the magic formula to pop.
Does that explain why your songs are so upbeat and escapist, even now?
Totally. I think there's a double standard in music where the stuff that gets taken seriously is sad and depressed, because those emotions are so hard. But a lot of the time, I feel very depressed and the way to get myself out of it is to write a ridiculous song. If I write a sad one, it's just going to make me sadder.
So, for me, making happy songs, or slutty songs, takes just as much effort as writing a slow ballad. Just because it doesn't seem like there's any hurt or pain going into the creation of that, it doesn't mean it's not there.
Can you imagine a time where you would write about the things you went through as a teenager?
I try to stay away from the past. I find the past quite useless. I'm more focused on new and exciting things. But yeah, I definitely feel like, after releasing so many different projects, I need to go down new routes. Maybe it would be more about the stuff I'm currently going through, rather than the past.
The lyrics on Slut Pop aren't especially deep, but the idea of relishing and celebrating sex still feels quite radical in pop. Why do you think that is?
It's something I feel strongly about. I've always been surrounded by incredible women. Even at school, the people who stood up for me and understood my condition were female.
And I think men's desire to control women's bodies has been the plague of this planet forever. It very much goes hand in hand with being transgender. The people who wanted to forbid me to transition are the same ones who want to forbid women to have abortions or have sex and even make money from it.
I'm a big fan of Madonna's work, and I feel like, when she celebrated sex in Erotica and her Sex book, people misunderstood it as just filth. But female sexuality isn't filth, and it shouldn't be written off like that. Neither is trans-feminine sexuality or anyone's sexuality. I think everybody should be equal.
That's not to say Slut Pop is a big political statement. It's supposed to just be fun, but the conversation it stirs up is a good thing.
A lot of the Slut Pop songs have blown up on TikTok. What are your thoughts on Universal Music removing music, including yours, from the app while they argue over royalty payments?
I feel very protected by Universal. I know people who have number one records and can't afford their rent, so I'm proud Universal is taking a stand.
Of course, right now, all of us Universal artists are screwed a little bit, but you've gotta take one for the team. The intentions are noble. It's about musicians making money from their art - and not just the famous faces, but the songwriters and the people behind the scenes. I feel like it's a really good fight.
When royalty payments are so low, do you ever think about going back to your first job and writing advertising jingles?
Me and my friends still make jingles all the time, just for fun. And if I ever had a stroke of genius and came up with something where I'm like, 'This has laundry detergent written all over it', then, for sure, I'm not above it.
And about the money thing: I know what it's like to struggle and be a songwriter who lives on a studio couch and goes a year without getting any songs released but, at the end of the day, as long as I can write music, I'm happy. The money part is really for my fans. I want to put on the best show for them.
You're opening the Euro 2024 football tournament this summer. What can you tell us about that?
I'm over the moon about it. Soccer is such a big part of German culture, so it feels like a huge deal. I have so many memories of watching matches with my friends and getting absolutely hammered, so it's gonna be crazy!
Plus, the opening match is Germany v Scotland, so there'll be a lot of kilts in the stadium.
Oh my God, that's my dream.

2024-03-11T15:47:41.000Z,This Morning: Cat Deeley and Ben Shephard make their debut,BBC News,"Cat Deeley and Ben Shephard have said they are ""so excited"" as they make their debut on This Morning.
The pair thanked viewers for their well wishes, with Shephard saying they were ""thrilled"" to be taking over the show.
After a long search by ITV, the stars have replaced Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby, who quit last year.
Schofield initially left amid reports of a rift with Willoughby. A week later, he admitted lying about an affair with a younger colleague.
Since then, the show has been presented by a number of guest presenters - including Deeley and Shephard, who were finally unveiled as permanent hosts last month.
Deeley said that the show had been a ""huge part"" of her and Shephard's lives for ""so long"".
""So to be actually standing here with you, it's good,"" she added.
For their first episode, they received good luck messages from Ant and Dec and football pundit Chris Kamara.
Ant and Dec worked with Deeley on SM:TV, and joked that Deeley was a party girl.
""She might be all sweetness and light, but that girl can party, don't think she can't,"" Ant said.
Dec added: ""Keep the lock on the drinks cabinet!""
Deeley responded by saying: ""Listen, my motto in life [is] work hard, play hard.""
Former footballer Kamara, with whom Shephard worked on the ITV game show Ninja Warrior UK, also had a warning for Deeley about her new co-star.
""He's like a bear with a sore head when West Ham get beat and the rest of the time he is just miserable.""
""Only kidding,"" he added. ""Let me tell you, Cat, he was one of the best things to happen to me and I'm sure you will see that, and vice versa, of course.""
The pair's first episode continued with a discussion of the Mother's Day photo of the Princess of Wales and her children, which has been withdrawn by multiple photo agencies over concerns it was ""manipulated"".
Guest Gyles Brandreth made a blunder during the conversation, when he announced that ITV had commissioned a series about Catherine, called The Lost Princess, with Sheridan Smith playing the lead role.
The information actually originated on a social media parody account, where Smith is announced as the leading lady in any TV dramatisation of a news event.
Regardless of the slip-up, the panel returned to the topic an hour later, after Catherine apologised ""for any confusion"" the edited photo had caused, in a statement posted on Kensington Palace's social media.
The show also included its typical features, with a cooking segment focused on air fryers, and viewers calling in for dating advice from relationship expert Mel Schilling.
Deeley and Shephard also interviewed Jools Holland and Sir Rod Stewart, whose joint album Swing Fever recently reached number one.
At the end of the interview, the musical duo applauded the new presenters, with Sir Rod wishing them luck and calling them ""the best"".
Holland joked that Shephard and Deeley had managed to survive the interview without getting ""cancelled"".
Deeley rose to fame on the kids shows SM:TV and CD:UK, and subsequently became a big star in the US, winning an Emmy for the primetime talent show So You Think You Can Dance.
Shephard started his career on The Bigger Breakfast and T4; and was one of the main presenters on Good Morning Britain until he left for This Morning.
The duo will host the magazine show from Monday to Thursday, while Alison Hammond and Dermot O'Leary will continue to present the Friday edition.
Hammond had previously been tipped to take over the main show, with tabloid press reporting she had been offered a ""huge pay rise"" to increase her workload.
However, she played down the speculation over the weekend, telling The Sunday Times: ""We're the Friday guys! We love being Friday guys!'
Asked whether there had been discussions about increasing her presence on the show, she said: ""Absolutely not. How could I?
""I live in Birmingham and do Bake Off and For the Love of Dogs. I never wanted that job. Last year we did extra because we were going through issues, but Cat and Ben will save that show.""
Deeley and Shephard's debut marks the end of a long period of upheaval at This Morning, which has been fronted by guest presenters since last year.
Schofield had been a fixture on the programme for two decades, but the news of his affair became a major scandal and sparked a crisis for the show.
In August, the House of Commons media committee said a ""large number"" of employees past and present had been in touch to make claims of wider ""toxic working cultures, bullying, discrimination and harassment"" behind the scenes.
Dr Ranj Singh, a former regular contributor, has also spoken out, saying the ""culture at This Morning had become toxic"".
ITV's chief executive has said she does ""not recognise"" claims of a toxic culture on the programme.
In September 2023, This Morning failed to win at the audience-voted National Television Awards for the first time in 13 years.
The show currently attracts about 800,000 viewers per day.

2024-02-27T13:40:09.000Z,Sean 'Diddy' Combs accused of sexual assault by male producer,BBC News,"Sean Combs has been sued by a music producer who has accused him of sexual assault and being forced to have sex with sex workers.
Rodney ""Lil Rod"" Jones alleges he was a victim of unsolicited groping and sexual touching while he was working for the rapper on his latest album.
This is the fifth law suit with sexual assault allegations against Mr Combs.
Responding to the lawsuit filed in a New York court, a lawyer for the artist said it was ""pure fiction"".
Mr Combs' attorney, Shawn Holley, added: ""We have overwhelming, indisputable proof that his claims are complete lies.
""We will address these outlandish allegations in court and take all appropriate action against those who make them.""
According to court documents, the music producer lived and travelled with Mr Combs between September 2022 and November 2023.
His lawyers say he was drugged and ""recalls waking up naked, dizzy, and confused. He was in bed with two sex workers and Mr Combs"".
Jones also alleges in his suit that the rapper was ""grooming him to pass him off to his friends"" and ""engaging in serious illegal activity"".
A number of photos of parties at Combs' house were included in the suit. The court documents claim that the photos include underage girls and sex workers who it is alleged were supplied with drugs.
Other defendants named in the suit include Mr Combs' son, Justin, his chief of staff, Kristina Khorram, Universal Music Group chief executive Sir Lucian Grainge and former Motown Records CEO Ethiopia Habtemariam.
The suit alleges that Grainge, Habtemariam, Motown Records, Love Records and Universal Music Group ""failed to adequately monitor, warn, or supervise"" the actions of Mr Combs, his son and his chief of staff.
A representative for Justin Combs told website TMZ that ""they are all lies"" and that this was a ""clear example of a desperate person taking desperate measures in hopes of a pay day"".
Jones is seeking $30m.
The legal case is the fifth such action against Mr Combs.
The 54-year-old's ex-girlfriend, Cassandra ""Cassie"" Ventura, sued him in November, alleging the record label executive raped her in 2018 and subjected her to years of sexual and physical abuse.
The musicians settled the lawsuit two days later. ""I have decided to resolve this matter amicably on terms that I have some level of control,"" said Ventura in a statement.
Four more accusers have now filed lawsuits against him.
One alleged Mr Combs drugged and sexually assaulted her and then showed video of the assault to others, while another woman alleged Mr Combs and another man took turns raping her and her friend in the early 1990s.
Combs has denied all the allegations against him and in December said: ""Let me be absolutely clear: I did not do any of the awful things being alleged. I will fight for my name, my family and for the truth.""

2024-03-08T09:36:13.000Z,British Book Awards: Prince Harry and Britney Spears memoirs nominated,BBC News,"Memoirs by Britney Spears and the Duke of Sussex have been shortlisted for the British Book Awards Book of the Year.
Prince Harry's Spare, the bestselling book of 2023, is nominated in two categories.
It comes three decades after his father, the King, was named author of the year in 1990, the first year of the awards.
Other memoirs nominated include Star Trek's Sir Patrick Stewart and comic character Alan Partridge's.
Britney Spears' much-hyped autobiography, The Woman in Me, which went on sale in October 2023, was one of the bestselling memoirs of the year.
In the book, the pop star documented her career and what it was like to be controlled by her father for 13 years under a conservatorship.
She also opened up about a medical abortion she had during her relationship with Justin Timberlake in the early 2000s and the emotional impact that had on her.
The rising number of author-podcasters is also reflected in the shortlist, with Steven Bartlett receiving two nominations for The Diary of a CEO, named after his chart-topping podcast, and former cabinet minister Rory Stewart nominated for Politics on the Edge.
Newcomer Yomi Adegoke's The List, about cancel culture and influencers, has also been shortlisted in two categories - Audiobook: Fiction and Debut Fiction.
The 32-year-old told BBC News: ""The subject matter of The List made it a risky book to write and an even riskier choice for a debut novel, so receiving two Nibbies nominations is as exciting as it is surprising.
""It is especially rare to see books that are unapologetically about black people, written by black authors, supported within the mainstream this way, so I am so pleased it's being recognised at one of the biggest book awards in the country.""
A number of the authors nominated have BookTok hits, a hashtag with over 200 billion views on TikTok that refers to a community of book lovers sharing favourite reads and reviews.
Some of the authors with BookTok hits nominated in the pageturner category are:
Award-winning author and illustrator Alice Oseman has also risen to fame on TikTok.
Her chart-topping series Heartstopper includes the UK's fastest-selling graphic novel to date.
Oseman told BBC News she was ""incredibly excited"" to be shortlisted, in the Children's Illustrated category.
""Nick and Charlie's love story has been embraced by so many readers and booksellers and I've been blown away by the response,"" she said.
""I feel very honoured to have the fifth volume in their story recognised in this way.""
Other authors nominated for children's literature include:
Rundell said: ""Any prize that puts books - books which can shake your day into a different shape, crowbar the world open for you - to the forefront of people's attention is something to treasure.""
Lucas told BBC News the response to his book had been ""overwhelming"" and he was ""really proud"" of what it had achieved.
""I'm indebted to my publisher, Farshore, because when I suddenly said, ""Oh and by the way, this is going to be a musical novel,"" they absolutely ran with it,"" he added.
In the children's non-fiction category Sathnam Sanghera is nominated for Stolen History: The Truth About the British Empire And How It Shaped Us.
In the crime & thriller category, Richard Osman has been nominated, for The Last Devil to Die, the fourth novel in his million-copy bestselling The Thursday Murder Club series.
Murder-mystery stories also feature in the non-fiction lifestyle and Illustrated category, with GT Karber shortlisted for his puzzle book and UK Christmas number-one, Murdle.
The winners of the 12 categories of the British Book Award, known as the Nibbies because of the golden nib-shaped trophy, will be announced on 13 May.

2024-03-08T17:20:24.000Z,Queer Eye: Tan France denies involvement in Bobby Berk being 'fired',BBC News,"Tan France has denied he was involved in his co-star Bobby Berk being ""fired"" from Netflix series Queer Eye.
A Rolling Stone report had alleged that France had ""campaigned to replace Berk"" with his friend, interior designer Jeremiah Brent.
Berk announced he was leaving the makeover show last year, saying it had ""not been an easy decision"".
France, the show's stylist, said his efforts to get Brent hired were not connected to Berk's exit from the show.
In an Instagram reel, France said: ""My former colleague getting fired had nothing to do with me trying to get my friend hired.
""Netflix and the production companies did a full-on casting.
""I didn't put my friend up for the job, they ended up getting it because they were the best person for the job.""
Berk has since tweeted a gif of Michelle Obama, which includes her catchphrase: ""When they go low, we go high!""
The Rolling Stone report also alleged that hairstylist Jonathan Van Ness was a ""nightmare"" to work with on set, who made filming ""difficult"" due to his behaviour.
Van Ness, Netflix, the other Queer Eye cast members and ITV Entertainment, which produces the show, did not respond to the BBC's request for comment earlier this week.
Berk and Netflix have been approached for further comment following France's comments on Friday.
Other than France, none of the parties involved have said publicly that Berk was fired from the show.
France did not address the alleged tensions on set in his Instagram post.
He continued by saying he was happy that Brent - who has presented shows on home channel HGTV with his husband, fellow designer Nate Berkus - had joined the show.
""I think they're going to be incredible on the show but I didn't get them hired by getting rid of somebody else,"" France added.
France went on to say the rumour about his own involvement in the situation originated from a comment on a gossip blog, that ""has almost become gospel"".
In January, Berk told Vanity Fair that he and France ""would be fine"" after it was widely speculated the pair had fallen out.
He acknowledged some tension between him and France, commenting: ""There was a situation, and that's between Tan and I, and it has nothing to do with the show. It was something personal that had been brewing - and nothing romantic, just to clarify that.""
In the same interview, he said he had been offered a contract by Netflix to return to the series after the streamer unexpectedly decided to renew it for another season.
He said he and his co-stars, known as the fab five, were not planning to return - but he claimed the other four later changed their minds.
By that point, he said, he had made other plans on the basis there would not be a new series, and said he ""just wasn't willing to change those [plans]"".

2024-03-06T13:43:47.000Z,Gabriel García Márquez: Sons publish last novel that late author wanted destroyed,BBC News,"When Nobel Prize-winning author Gabriel García Márquez died a decade ago, he left behind a novel he had written while struggling with dementia.
In his final days, he told his sons the book must be destroyed.
However they defied their father and, in what they have called an act of ""betrayal"", have published the book.
Until August has received mixed reviews, with The Guardian's critic describing it as a ""sketch, as blurry and flawed as sketches generally are"".
""But a sketch from a master is welcome,"" Lucy Hughes-Hallett added.
She said the 100-page book ""is like a faded souvenir, tatty but treasurable for its associations with the fabulous imaginary world that Márquez conjured up in his prime"".
The Colombian writer, who died in 2014, was best known for pioneering the magical realist style of writing.
He wrote books including Love in the Time of Cholera and One Hundred Years of Solitude, which has sold more than 50 million copies worldwide.
Justifying their decision to publish, García Márquez's son Gonzalo told BBC Radio 4's Front Row that by the end, the author ""wasn't in a position to judge his work as he could only see the flaws but not the interesting things that were there"".
After reading the text again recently, Gonzalo said he didn't ""find it as disastrous as Gabo had judged it"" and that it was a valuable addition to his work because it showed a new side to him and was ""unique"".
""Definitely, we weren't going to destroy it,"" he said. ""In 2022, we took one of the versions and we read it, and there really wasn't a lot of discussion about it.
""We realised that the book was complete, we realised that we didn't have to do a lot of editing. There are no additions, there are no great changes. So there really wasn't any discussion there.
""We did think about it for about three seconds - was it a betrayal to my parents, to my father's [wishes]?
""And we decided, yes, it was a betrayal. But that's what children are for.""
He said it was bound to eventually be published, so the family wanted to publish a version they approved of, and which would protect its copyright.
The novel centres on a middle-aged woman who travels alone to an island every summer to visit her mother's grave, and during each trip takes a new lover despite being happily married.
It is the first time that García Márquez has centred on a female protagonist.
The i newspaper's Max Liu said ""his family and his publishers should have respected his wishes"" to not publish the book.
""Usually, in a review of an underwhelming posthumous publication or minor work by a major author, it is worth saying that, despite its flaws, it will delight devoted fans.
""I do not believe that is true of Until August. Márquez knew this and was right not to want it to see the light of day,"" he continued.
Nonetheless, he added that the ""novel has qualities"" and ""it is set in a world that strikes an evocative balance between the real and dreamlike"".
In a three-star review, The Telegraph's Sarah Perry said the cumulative effect of the book ""is oddly moving"".
""It's as if the book contained both Marquez the elder and Marquez the younger, with the perception and weary good humour of old age conveyed in the searching, tentative manner of the apprentice,"" she wrote.
She noted, however, that the ""the novel is stripped of the endless, inventive discursions into folk-tale, backstory and verbal brio that characterise the best of Marquez"".
""Until August does nothing to enlarge the legend of Gabo; it does nothing to diminish it,"" she concluded.
As well as a new book, Márquez's 1967 novel One Hundred Years of Solitude is being adapted into a Spanish-language Netflix series.
According to the New York Times, Márquez received many offers over the years to adapt his book into a film but refused because he only wanted it to be done in Spanish.
García Márquez's book is not the first novel to be published posthumously against the authors' wishes.
Hear more from Gonzalo García Barcha on BBC Radio 4's Front Row from 19:15 GMT on Wednesday, 6 March, and then on BBC Sounds.
Until August will be published in the UK on Tuesday, 12 March.

Degun, from Leeds, was named best instrumentalist at the prestigious classical music ceremony on Tuesday.
He told BBC News the prize was ""testament to the hundreds of Indian classical musicians in this country"".
""And it feels like we've really stepped forward into the classical psyche, which is wonderful,"" he said.
Degun picked up his award at a ceremony in Manchester - the first time the RPS event has been held outside London in its 35-year history.
He composed and appeared in Orpheus, an acclaimed new version of Monteverdi's Orfeo combining Indian and Western classical music for Opera North, which was nominated for best large-scale composition.
Degun's debut album, Anomaly, came out on Peter Gabriel's Real World Records in 2022.
""One of the musicians who I worked with on the album plays tennis with Peter Gabriel,"" he said.
""So he put me in touch, and then we got an email from Peter saying, 'This is a brilliant album.' That was the first domino of me being signed.""
Previous winners of the RPS instrumentalist award include violinist Nicola Benedetti, cellist Steven Isserlis and percussionist Dame Evelyn Glennie.
Other winners this year included charismatic Scottish tenor Nicky Spence, who was named singer of the year; and the London Symphony Orchestra's principal guest conductor François-Xavier Roth, who won best conductor.
Ukrainian opera Chornobyldorf - described as ""a post-apocalyptic fantasy"" and featuring often naked performers - won the opera and music prize, beating entries by the Royal Opera and Glyndebourne.
A team of 20 singers, musicians and technicians travelled from Ukraine to stage it at the Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival and in a Liverpool nightclub last year.
Composer Illia Razumeiko described the award as ""a miracle"".
""It's very unexpected for us to be listed together with big classical class-A opera houses like Royal Opera,"" he said.
""It's a big honour and a big joy for all our team and all our our colleagues in Ukraine.""
The BBC Singers, who were under threat of closure until a reprieve last month, were named best ensemble; and the two-day Manchester Classical festival won best event.
The award ceremony was held at Manchester's Royal Northern College of Music, and the decision to stage it in the city was partly inspired by last year's wins for the Manchester Collective and Manchester Camerata, RPS chief executive James Murphy said.
""It's a very creative and fertile city,"" he said. ""There's an incredible music-loving community here, and Manchester has welcomed us with open arms.""

2024-03-09T11:03:41.000Z,Razzie Awards 2024: Winnie the Pooh slasher film and Expend4bles named year's worst,BBC News,"Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey has swept the board at the Razzie Awards, winning five of the 10 categories.
The slasher film took advantage of the copyright for AA Milne's classic tale expiring, and reimagined the characters of the Hundred Acre Wood as vicious serial killers.
Sylvester Stallone's Expend4bles also picked up two awards.
Announced the day before the Oscars reward Hollywood's finest, the Razzies name and shame the year's worst films.
The organisers describe their awards as the ""ugly cousin to the Oscars"".
When it was released last year, the Pooh film received a string of downright awful reviews.
The Guardian called it a ""a terrifying combination of not-scary and not-funny"" awarding it one star, while Empire said it was ""the poorest writing and acting seen in a theatrically-released horror film in living memory"".
The movie won worst picture, worst screenplay, worst director and worst rip-off. Pooh and Piglet, depicted in the film as blood-thirsty killers, also won worst on-screen couple.
But the negative reviews have not deterred director Rhys Frake-Waterfield, who won worst director. He has announced a sequel to the film and other horror films centring on beloved children characters such as Bambi and Peter Pan.
According to US copyright laws, rights to characters can be held for 95 years. After that, the characters can be legally shared, performed, reused, repurposed or sampled by anyone without permission or cost.
At the beginning of 2024, the copyright for Walt Disney's 1928 animated short film Steamboat Willie expired.
As a result, the trailer for another new slasher film, featuring a masked killer dressed as Mickey Mouse, was released on the same day the copyright expired.
A new Mickey-inspired horror game, showing the rodent covered with blood stains, also dropped on the same day.
Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey did manage to escape winning in some categories, most notably worst actor and actress.
The worst actor award went to Oscar winner Jon Voight for his role as an Irish mobster in Mercy.
The film, which follows a former combat surgeon who faces ruthless Irish gangsters holding innocent patients hostage, received mainly negative reviews.
Megan Fox picked up two awards this year - one for worst actress in horror-heist film Johnny & Clyde and the other for worst supporting actress for her role in the fourth instalment of the Expendables franchise.
Expend4bles, as it is stylised, also saw Sylvester Stallone, who has been nominated 16 times over the years, win worst supporting actor.

2024-03-12T13:31:13.000Z,"CMAT: From Brit Awards to BBC 6 Music Festival, a new pop star has arrived",BBC News,"At one point during last weekend's Brit Awards, Clara Amfo was introducing the next performer when she glanced to her side and broke off from her script.
""Ooh, she'd better calm down!"" the co-host nervously exclaimed.
Next to Clara, a woman wearing an elegant full-length black gown with balloon sleeves and bronze beehive had spun around to reveal that the back of her dress was a lot more revealing than the front.
It had a large cut-out area exposing her back, plus the top half of her buttocks.
The woman put a leather-gloved hand to her mouth in mock horror at her own exposure before breaking into a wide mischievous grin and exiting stage right, her mission accomplished.
""We've calmed down,"" Amfo confirmed, creasing with laughter.
The woman was CMAT, the rising Irish singer who was nominated for international artist of the year.
It was the sort of moment that people (mainly people who remember the 1990s) complain is missing from the modern Brit Awards  - pop stars behaving badly. Or if not badly, at least cheekily. In this case, literally.
CMAT's moment didn't quite spark the same tabloid frenzy as the last great pop star bum at the Brits - Jarvis Cocker's, being wiggled in the direction of Michael Jackson in 1996 - but it was an attention-seeking intervention, and it succeeded.
Six days after the ceremony, CMAT proved she is worthy of attention for more than her outfits, stealing the show at the BBC Radio 6 Music Festival in Manchester, where she announced herself as one of pop's best new performers.
The charismatic country-rock singer-songwriter's captivating set signalled that she's ""taking off to the stratosphere"", 6 Music DJ and singer Cerys Matthews wrote afterwards.
Fellow presenter Stuart Maconie described it as ""one of the most brilliant things I've seen in years"".
CMAT - Ciara Mary-Alice Thompson - started her career in Dublin, but the city was ""a wasteland"" for women trying to pursue music, she told 6 Music's Matt Everitt.
""I felt was that I was this tokenistic prize of property. The minute that someone found out that there was a woman singer-songwriter in Dublin, I was suddenly getting booked for every support slot under the sun because they wanted to make themselves look good by having a woman on their line-up.
""But they may not have listened to my music, and certainly I wasn't getting booked or encouraged to be a headliner.""
She moved to England - to Manchester because she couldn't afford London - but it wasn't a happy time and she still struggled.
A turning point came when she got a place to attend a fan session listening to unreleased music by boundary-pushing pop singer Charli XCX.
When it was CMAT's turn to give her views, she gave brutally honest feedback about the songs. It was enough for Charli to recognise she had musical nous.
""She pulled me aside afterwards and was like, 'Clearly you know loads about music, and clearly you're really talented, and you're not doing anything with your life right now. I don't know why but you should be doing far more than you're doing',"" CMAT told BBC Radio 1 last year.
""That is genuinely probably the most important thing that's ever happened to me. And I needed the person that I worshipped to give out to me and scold me, and that is what she did.""
After that kick up the now-famous backside, CMAT broke up with her boyfriend, moved back to Dublin, and reinvented herself.
Her debut album If My Wife New I'd Be Dead came out in 2022, and the follow-up Crazymad, For Me was released last year.
Despite encouragement from women like Charli, the music industry is still male-heavy. CMAT said it was ""is absolutely shocking and appalling"" that she didn't have a female producer or recording engineer on either album.
But she told Everitt: ""In the words of Garth Brooks, everything that is a blessing is a curse.
""When you're a woman in a situation where there's a room full of men, there is a kind of 'sink or swim' thing that happens. You either allow men to walk all over you and talk all over you, or you learn really quickly and very aggressively to stick up for yourself.
""And I actually think that if I had been in a comfortable environment very early on, I may not have learned how to be the director of my own music and be the basically co-producer of all my records.""
The two LPs have already made her a superstar in Ireland, both going to number one, with the debut winning the Choice Music Prize for Irish album of the year.
The follow-up was a painfully honest hangover from a messy relationship, its combination of regret and defiance laced with humour in off-kilter but fabulous pop songs.
It was named the second best album of 2023 by the Observer and earned her a place on the BBC Sound of 2024 list, as well as the Brit nomination.
Which brings us back to that outfit.
She was, she claimed, making a ""political"" point as well as making trouble.
She made sure the amount of bum crack on show was the same as the average amount of breast cleavage, which is seen as acceptable, she told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour in the aftermath.
Models and others have worn similar ""bumster"" outfits before, she pointed out.
""I think mine caused a stir because it's big and because I'm a size 14 as opposed to a size six, which is commonly what you do see on television especially when it comes to musicians and pop stars.
""I had a lot of people that were very angry that I would do such a thing. They were horrified, and people were really angry and aggressive in comments, telling me I had to go to the gym. The backlash was crazy.""
Speaking to 6 Music, she added: ""Loads of people in the comments are like, 'She's attention seeking! She's an attention seeker!' So? Yeah, that's my job!""
At the station's festival, she grabbed the crowd's attention - whether by hurling herself around the stage with wild abandon, or body-popping with her keyboardist, or persuading several thousand 6 Music listeners to do a line dance during I Wanna Be A Cowboy, Baby!
And she also commanded attention by simply standing still and holding hands with special guest John Grant on a scintillating duet of Where Are Your Kids Tonight, which showed off the operatic kick in her voice.
The intoxicating show left the impression that a star had arrived, and that it won't be long before she's the headliner at last.

2024-02-23T15:42:49.000Z,Tyler Perry halts £630m film studio build over AI fears,BBC News,"US film and TV giant Tyler Perry says he's putting a $800m (£630m) expansion of his studio on hold after becoming concerned over new AI technology.
He was due to add 12 sound stages to his Atlanta complex, but says he has been put off by the release of OpenAI's video generator Sora.
Perry, 54, believes ""a lot of jobs"" will be lost in the film industry because of artificial intelligence.
He told the Hollywood Reporter that Sora had ""shocking"" capabilities.
""All of that [work] is currently and indefinitely on hold because of Sora and what I'm seeing,"" he said.
""I had gotten word over the last year or so that this was coming, but I had no idea until I saw recently the demonstrations of what it's able to do. It's shocking to me.""
The tool, which has been made by the company behind ChatGPT, was launched in a limited way earlier this month and is not yet open to public consumption.
OpenAI's CEO took requests from followers on X, formerly known as Twitter, and produced videos with their suggestions to show its capabilities.
With access to few resources and a couple of text prompts, it was able to produce lifelike footage up to one minute long.
Perry said the technology could make travelling to locations and building sets redundant: ""I can sit in an office and do this with a computer, which is shocking to me,"" he said.
He added that he was ""very, very concerned"" that this could mean jobs for actors, editors, sound specialists and transporters could be lost.
Perry, who has starred in films such as Don't Look Up and Gone Girl, did say however that he had recently used AI on set to make himself older for a scene, which meant he ""avoided having to sit through hours of aging makeup"".
AI is already on the minds of many in the industry and was one of the main sticking points during the 2023 Hollywood strikes.
Many writers were concerned about their jobs being taken by AI, whilst actors were concerned that the technology could be used to replace them on set.
Despite an agreement being reached between studios and Hollywood workers, Perry said the ""whole industry"" needs to come together to protect people's livelihoods.
""It can't be one union fighting every contract every two or three years. I think that it has to be everybody, all involved in how do we protect the future of our industry because it is changing rapidly, right before our eyes,"" he said.

Levy, who co-created the comedy series Schitt's Creek with his son Daniel, accepted the honour with his real-life and on screen families.
""My son Daniel couldn't be here today, sadly,"" the Canadian actor said.
""My second son, Jim, is here, from American Pie, and I love the fact you're here, Jason,"" he added.
Levy portrayed Noah Levenstein, the father of Jason Biggs's character, Jim, in the 1999 hit film and its sequels.
The coming of age comedy, with its watch-through-your-fingers moments, became infamous for a scene featuring a freshly baked apple pie.
It also starred Jennifer Coolidge, Seann William Scott and Alyson Hannigan.
Joining Levy for the star unveiling on Friday was his Schitt's Creek on-screen wife Catherine O'Hara, and his real-life daughter Sarah Levy, who plays Twyla Sands on the Emmy-winning TV show.
Explaining that Daniel was filming in Bulgaria, Levy joked that it sounded like a plot ""right out of Schitt's Creek"".
Sarah Levy introduced her father at the ceremony on Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles, and recalled visiting him on set when she was a child.
O'Hara, who also starred in Home Alone, described Levy as ""a gentleman in every sense of the word"".
""We all know and love Eugene Levy for the wealth of original, thought-provoking, heartfelt, and ridiculously hilarious entertainment he has gifted us for so many years,"" she said.
Levy, who also appeared in Cheaper By The Dozen 2 and Father Of The Bride Part II, said ""getting a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame is about as far from Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, as you can get"".
He paid tribute to his wife Deborah Divine, saying: ""You can't have your name put on a star in Hollywood Boulevard without someone having your back and Debs had mine for 47 years, there would be no star without you.""
""How rewarding was that, a life spent making people laugh?"" he added.

2024-03-06T10:18:04.000Z,"Colin Firth's wet shirt from Pride and Prejudice sells at auction for £25,000",BBC News,"Millions of viewers around the world swooned over Colin Firth as he strode out of a lake wearing a wet shirt as Mr Darcy in the BBC's 1995 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice.
Now, that same shirt has been bought for £25,000 in an auction in London.
Before the sale, auctioneers had given it an estimated price of £7,000 to £10,000.
It's one of more than 60 costumes from film and TV sold on Tuesday, with all of the proceeds going to charity.
Outfits worn by Madonna, Margot Robbie and Johnny Depp were also part of the auction.
Hosted by Kerry Taylor Auctions, the sale contained treasures from the archives of Cosprop, a costume house founded by Oscar-winning designer John Bright.
The wet shirt scene didn't actually feature in Jane Austen's book, but that hasn't stopped it becoming one of the most famous TV moments of all time.
It showed Mr Darcy (Firth) going for an impromptu swim in his private lake, filmed at Lyme Park near Stockport in Greater Manchester, before walking off in his clinging wet white shirt and running into his love interest, Elizabeth Bennet (Jennifer Ehle).
Viewers were glued to their screens, and Firth was instantly transformed into a sex symbol.
The scene has even been replicated on screen, including in the TV series Bridgerton and Bridget Jones' Diary.
Almost 30 years later, the shirt - now dry - has been sold.
The hammer price was £20,000, double what was estimated. The buyer's premium was £5,000, taking the total to £25,000, all of which will go to charity.
It is one of several shirts that were used during filming. Another was already auctioned for charity, and a third remains in the Cosprop archive, auctioneer Taylor told BBC News.
Other outfits in the auction included the Christian Dior ball gown worn by Madonna in Evita, Drew Barrymore's costume in Ever After, and the dress and cape worn by Meryl Streep in The French Lieutenant's Woman.
Depp's costume in Sleepy Hollow, and Heath Ledger's masquerade ball costume from Casanova, were also up for sale.
Costumes from TV drama series including Poldark, Peaky Blinders and Downton Abbey also went under the hammer.
The entire collection spans more than 400 years of fashion history, with costumes ranging in style from fantasy Renaissance to mid-20th Century silhouettes.
Taylor described the auction as ""a wonderful opportunity to own a piece of screen history,"" with the outfits all having been worn by acting legends.
Cosprop donated the costumes in support of The Bright Foundation, a Hastings-based arts education charity, established and funded by Bright to provide creative experiences for children and young people facing disadvantage.
""My life's work has been committed to costume design for film, TV and theatre,"" said Bright. ""It is my firmly held belief that the arts and creativity can shape happier and healthier children and enable young people to reach their full potential.""
An online auction, running until 10 March, will also feature film and TV-related experiences and celebrity memorabilia. The list of lots includes the signed script for Love Actually donated by Richard Curtis and Emma Freud.

2024-02-25T04:05:19.000Z,SAG Awards 2024: Oppenheimer dominates ahead of Oscars,BBC News,"Oppenheimer continued its dominance of awards season as it scored several major prizes at the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) Awards on Saturday.
Christopher Nolan's film won best film cast, while Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr won individual acting prizes.
Accepting the top prize on behalf of the cast, Sir Kenneth Branagh said they were all ""grateful, humbled and proud"".
The evening was peppered with remarks about the actors' strike, which brought Hollywood to a standstill last year.
Paying tribute to the US actors' union, Sir Kenneth said: ""Thank you for fighting for us, thank you for every Sag-Aftra member whose support and whose sacrifice allows us to be standing here better than we were before.""
He recalled the night last July when the cast of Oppeheimer downed tools at the film's London premiere as the strike began.
""We went from the red carpet, we didn't see the film that night, we happily went in the direction of solidarity with your good selves, so this is a full circle moment for us,"" he told the audience of actors.
""We are grateful and humbled and proud not just to be in Mr Nolan's masterpiece, but proud to be in your company.""
The film, about theoretical physicist J Robert Oppenheimer, described as the father of the atomic bomb, is almost certain to win best picture at the Oscars next month following its success at SAG and other precursor ceremonies.
The prize for best film cast is seen as the top honour at the SAG Awards in the absence of a best picture category. Winners at the annual ceremony, held in Los Angeles, are voted for by other actors.
Irish actor Cillian Murphy said his win was ""extremely, extremely special to me, because it comes from you guys"".
He recalled: ""Twenty-eight years ago when I was trying to become an actor, I was a failed musician, and I felt extremely like an interloper, but looking out on all of you guys here today, I know I'm part of something truly wonderful, so thank you so much.""
Best actor had been seen a two-horse race ahead of the Oscars on 10 March, but Murphy's win gives him significant momentum over his nearest rival, Paul Giamatti of The Holdovers.
Elsewhere, Killers of the Flower Moon star Lily Gladstone was named best leading actress - giving her own Oscars campaign a significant boost.
""This has been a hard year for all of us, those of us in this room, those not in this room, I'm so proud that we have gotten here in solidarity with all of our other unions,"" she said in her acceptance speech.
""It's truly a gift that we get to do this for a living. That's the win, getting to be here, getting to be on set, getting to tell stories. We bring empathy into a world that so needs it.""
She added: ""It's so easy to distance ourselves, to close off, stop feeling, and [actors] all bravely keep feeling, it brings people out of the shadows, it brings visibility.""
Gladstone's win leaves the Oscars category for best actress too close to call, following Poor Things star Emma Stone's victory at last week's Baftas.
The Holdovers star Da'Vine Joy Randolph was named best supporting actress, a prize she has won consistently throughout awards season and she is almost certain to take at the Oscars.
""I wake up every day overwhelmed with gratitude to be a working actor,"" she said. ""In what other profession are people able to live so many lives and touch so many hearts of those they have never gotten to meet?""
She added: ""For every actor out there still waiting in the wings for their chance, let me tell you your life can change in a day, it is not a question of if, but when - keep going.""
Oppenheimer's Robert Downey Jr, who has similarly been dominating his category, was named best supporting actor.
He described the award as ""incredibly meaningful"", and acknowledged his Oscar front-runner status by asking: ""Why me, why now, why do things seem to be going my way?""
Winners in the television categories included Ali Wong and Steven Yeun for Netflix's road rage series Beef, and Pedro Pascal for post-apocalyptic drama The Last of Us.
Ayo Edebiri and Jeremy Allen White were also recognised for kitchen comedy The Bear, while Elizabeth Debicki won best drama actress for playing Princess Diana in The Crown.
The Bear was named best ensemble comedy cast, while Succession won best ensemble drama cast for its critically-acclaimed fourth and final season.
""Not only did we all get to work on one of the best television shows, maybe ever, but we made friends for life,"" said actor Alan Ruck as he accepted the prize on behalf of the cast.
Tributes were paid to Matthew Perry, Harry Belafonte, Sir Michael Gambon, Tina Turner, Angus Cloud, Glenda Jackson, Alan Arkin, Julian Sands, Lance Reddick, Lee Sun-kyun, Tom Wilkinson, Andre Braugher and Chita Rivera in the show's In Memoriam segment.
The Devil Wears Prada stars Meryl Streep, Emily Blunt and Anne Hathaway were reunited to present the first award of the night.
Streep initially appeared to accidentally walk straight into the microphone stand - before explaining to the audience she did not have her glasses with her, or the envelope containing the winner.
The two actresses who played her on-screen assistants in the 2006 film then appeared with the envelope and glasses, before the trio delivered a joyous sketch featuring several of the movie's most famous lines.
Presenting another category, Melissa McCarthy asked Billie Eilish to sign her forehead as she told the singer what a huge fan she was, and the casts of Modern Family and Breaking Bad reunited to present the awards for best comedy and drama ensemble cast respectively.
The SAG Awards were streamed around the world on Netflix for the first time, something host Idris Elba referred to as he opened the ceremony.
""Personally, I can't wait to get home, and have Netflix recommend this show to me,"" the Wire star joked.
He also acknowledged what a ""difficult time"" it had been for actors during the recent strike, adding: ""I want to take a moment to honour and appreciate all of you, both here and watching at home, who stood up in solidarity and support.""
Elba said the ceremony being streamed instead of broadcast on a TV network meant actors could swear in their acceptance speeches - but he urged them not to go ""full Succession level"".
""Here's a good rule of thumb, don't say anything you wouldn't say in front of Oprah,"" he said, to an audience which included Oprah Winfrey herself.
The Morning Show star Jennifer Aniston and Maestro's Bradley Cooper presented this year's lifetime achievement prize to veteran singer and actress Barbra Streisand.
""All of us in this room and far beyond have been inspired by Barbra's magic,"" Aniston said. ""Barbra did not just pave the way for us women, she bulldozed it.""
Accepting her award, Streisand joked it was ""such a wonderful award to get, because you know in advance you're going to get it"".
Recalling her childhood, she said: ""I didn't like reality, I wanted to be in movies. Even though I knew I didn't look like the other women on screen. My mother said 'you'd better learn to type'. But I didn't listen. And somehow, some way, it all came true.""
""It's a privilege to be part of this profession. For a couple of hours, people can sit in the theatre and escape their own troubles - what an idea.""
She paid tribute to her fellow actors and directors, concluding: ""I've loved inhabiting that magical world of the movies with you.""

2024-02-20T17:32:24.000Z,London Fashion Week in pictures: Naomi Campbell makes surprise appearance,BBC News,"Original supermodel Naomi Campbell capped off a whirlwind few days at London Fashion Week, which was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
As usual, the front rows were packed with celebs looking for the hottest looks to translate from the catwalk to the red carpet.
London-born Campbell walked the runway at Burberry's closing show, held at Victoria Park, Tower Hamlets, on Monday.
The collection from designer Daniel Lee saw the luxury brand shift towards outdoor-wear (perfect for the rainy capital) in front of a star-studded crowd including Saltburn actor Barry Keoghan, Vogue editor Dame Anna Wintour and One Life star Joanna Lumley.
The actress, who famously played fashion director Patsy Stone in BBC sitcom Absolutely Fabulous, had herself taken to the runway for the Completedworks presentation on Friday.
Also spotted at the park were British models Cara Delevingne, Elizabeth Jagger and sister Georgia May Jagger, Iris Law and Lila Moss, while London-based footballers Bukayo Saka, Martin Odegaard, Son Heung-min, Ben Chilwell, all put their rivalries aside for the evening.
Earlier on Monday, London and Shanghai-based Canadian-Chinese designer Susan Fang revealed her collaboration with underwear brand Victoria's Secret.
She described its Valentine's Day theme as ""a magical fit"", having tied the knot with her husband earlier this month.
The romance theme continued on Sunday as Richard Quinn, who honed his skills at Christian Dior and Savile Row before establishing his eponymous label in 2017, presented a romantic floral-themed collection.
JW Anderson's show dressed down by comparison, unlike its Bafta-packed front row. Rosamund Pike was among the stars attending ahead of the evening's film awards.
The Northern Irishman has become known for his luxury must-haves, including £585 chain loafers, a celebrity favourite worn by Dua Lipa and Emma Corrin, according to Vogue.
Other celebrity ties included stylist Law Roach - known as the wardrobe force behind Hollywood star Zendaya - seen at Saturday's Roksanda display at Tate Britain.
The show's deep plum suit had previously been worn by the Dune 2 actress, reports The Times, although it couldn't quite match her eye-popping cyborg chic seen at last week's film premiere.
A more millennial theme flooded through Masha Popova's MTV It girl-inspired Friday collection, which should make early 30s-somethings feel right at home (Ugg boots anyone?)
Elsewhere, Edward Crutchley's show at Ironmonger's Hall took to the stars, or, as he put it: ""Saucy Greek god Dionysus.""
Similarly as progressive was designer Sinéad O'Dwyer's body positive show, which smashed through fashion clichés with pride - giving floor space to bold designs and models representing every dress size and circumstance.
A different kind of daring filled Harris Reed's opening day collection at the Tate Britain, bound up in eccentric couture that simply couldn't be ignored.
It was a fitting start to a typically boundary pushing London Fashion Week - 40 years young.

She is also the first woman to win songwriter of the year.
Collecting her prizes barefoot, she said: ""The artist I was three years ago would not believe I'm in control - I'm my own boss.""
Dua Lipa won best pop act while Kylie Minogue won the global icon award.
Dua Lipa thanked her fans for ""giving me this radical sense of confidence that I can do anything"".
She also thanked her father and manager, Dukagjin Lipa, calling him her ""Dadager Dougie"", adding: ""I'm so grateful we get to do this together.""
Raye's first award, for song of the year for Escapism, was given to her by former subpostmistress Jo Hamilton, who was a victim of the Horizon IT scandal.
She was joined on stage by the actress who played her in the recent ITV drama Mr Bates vs The Post Office, Monica Dolan.
Mrs Hamilton, who was falsely accused of stealing £36,000 from the Post Office, said on stage at London's O2 arena: ""I want to thank everyone in the country for the love and the support they have given the postmasters.
""Please can you keep on supporting us because, despite what the government says, they're not paying the postmasters.""
Raye, clearly amazed and overwhelmed by her wins, took her grandmother Agatha on stage with her by the time she was collecting her sixth, to collect album of the year. It was presented by her former headteacher from the Brits School, Stuart Worden.
Raye - whose hit singles also include Cigarette, Second and Welcome to the Winter - had years of rejection from her record label before being freed from her contract, allowing her to keep the songs she had written.
The singer-songwriter decided to release them herself, and her song Escapism went viral on TikTok and then to number one.
""You just don't understand what this means to me,"" the singer said between sobs. ""I'm ugly crying on national television.
""All I ever wanted to be was an artist, and now I'm an artist with an album of the year. Thank you so much, this is too much - come on Grandma, let's go.""
The show was presented by Clara Amfo, Maya Jama and Roman Kemp.
Amfo, who was Raye's ""first radio play"" on BBC Radio 1 10 years ago, told the singer: ""There is no such thing as an overnight success, I am so proud of you.""
Raye also called for the music industry to ""give songwriters master royalty costs"", saying: ""It means if the songs win big, the writers get to win too - please allow that to happen.""
Best international artist was won by US singer-songwriter SZA, who managed to beat stars including the mighty Taylor Swift.
Kylie, who has sold more than 80 million records globally, was the first female artist to score a number one album in five consecutive decades in the UK. As she collected her award, she said she would be ""sobbing with Raye"".
""It's been 36 years and counting. What gets me is a love of music and connection with people,"" she said.
""There's a part of me that's still a 14-year-old girl dreaming of making music. Thank you to anyone who's been part of my journey, you have my heart for ever and always.""
She sang a medley of her hits with numerous outfits, appearing on a giant podium in a flowing PVC dress. She removed it to reveal a white dress and black thigh boots, as she joined her dancers at stage level.
Kylie is following on from her success at the Grammys last month, where she won her second award - two decades after her first.
Other winners on the night included Calvin Harris, who won best dance act.
He kissed his wife, BBC Radio 1 DJ Vick Hope, as he collected his award and thanked his collaborator, singer Ellie Goulding.
""Ellie, I wouldn't be on this stage this year if it wasn't for you, what you brought to Miracle was unbelievable,"" he said, referencing their single.
""I couldn't have done it with anybody else in this room.""
Miley Cyrus won International Song of the Year for her hugely successful single Flowers, and Jungle won group of the year.
The three hosts included a skit where they dressed in Traitors cloaks, replicating the hit BBC One TV show by casting votes for who should perform next.
They were joined by none other than two of the show's contestants - Ross Carson and his Mum Diane, both of whom lost out on the big prize, but have gained popularity since leaving the show.
Although this moment went down well with the crowds, some viewers of the show on X were quick to poke fun at other aspects of it.
One X user compared the audience with the ""sad Oompa Loompa"" at the ill-fated Willy Wonka experience, which went viral on social media recently. They wrote: ""Omg this is all so low energy... has ITV served them all half a cup of lemonade & one jelly bean?""
Another compared it with an episode of The Apprentice, posting a picture of Lord Sugar on X saying: ""'This week I'm sending you to the O2 where I want you to put on a music awards show.""
But one user said the ceremony was ""outshining the Grammys in every way being the actual award ceremony that recognises talent and not payola"".
Raye's win for Best R&B Act prompted praise from singer Mahalia, who had successfully called on the Brits to give R&B its own category.
""That's how you do it. Against all the odds. Come on our girl... couldn't be prouder!!!!!"" she posted on X.
Another user poked fun at the executives at Raye's old record label, with a gif of Homer Simpson, from TV series The Simpsons, disappearing backwards into a hedge.
Ray's wins were also compared with the moment when Julia Roberts, in the film Pretty Woman, returns to the shop that had refused her custom, brandishing the bags of clothes she bought elsewhere.

US District Judge Lewis Kaplan said Jeanne Bellino waited too long to sue the 75-year-old rock star, according to the Reuters news agency.
Ms Bellino, a former model, claimed he had groped her in a Manhattan phone booth before pinning her against a wall later that day and simulating sex.
He ""vehemently"" denied the allegations.
The judge decided the case did not qualify for a two-year window for submitting claims that would otherwise fall outside the usual legal time limit, because Tyler's alleged conduct did not meet the criteria for posing a ""serious risk of physical injury"".
Tyler's lawyer David Long-Daniels told Reuters: ""We agree with the judge's reasoning, and are grateful for this result on behalf of our client.""

The character, Keith Bishop, was a scotch egg-loving accountant who had a monotone answerphone message and would have rather had a career as a DJ.
MacIntosh also appeared in other British comedies including Miranda and Little Britain.
The show's creator Ricky Gervais led the tributes on X/Twitter, describing MacIntosh as ""an absolute original"".
Bishop, who worked at fictional paper company Wernham Hogg, will be remembered for scenes such as when he dressed up as Ali G for Red Nose Day.
Big Keith particularly shone in a memorable scene from season two's episode Appraisals.
In his appraisal, office manager David Brent, played by Ricky Gervais, makes him list his strengths and weaknesses.
Chewing gum and looking bored, Keith responds ""don't know"" to all answers and lists eczema as his weakness and accounts as his strength.
MacIntosh appeared in both series of The Office, which was first broadcast in 2001.
Stephen Merchant, the co-writer and co-director of the BBC comedy series, told the BBC Radio 4's PM that MacIntosh was so funny the team ""started writing more and more scenes with him in and eventually he became our beloved characters"".
He added that with his ""delivery and timing"", MacIntosh was able to ""steal scenes from Ricky Gervais or Martin Freeman which is testament to him"".
Speaking about the appraisal scene, Merchant said it was based on a ""real BBC form they found in the building and Keith was used to typify the person who really doesn't want to engage with the bureaucratic process"".
He added that Ewen was ""a lovely guy to work with and a funny man who you knew would always bring an extra dimension"".
In 2017, MacIntosh played Lionel in British romantic comedy film Finding Fatimah.
He also appeared in the final season of Ricky Gervais' After Life, playing ""Buffet Man"", who had been banned from his local all you can eat restaurant.
In 2021, MacIntosh spoke to Vice about his character's passion for scotch eggs.
""My first scene with Martin [Freeman], where I eat the Scotch egg - we had trouble doing that for some reason,"" he recalled.
""It took ages to get that done. I got through a lot of Scotch eggs. I wasn't told about it. The props guy nipped out and bought them last minute.""
Actor Miranda Hart paid tribute to MacIntosh and said she was glad they got to do a scene together on her BBC comedy show Miranda.
""We were the same age and crossed paths many times as we did our best to be funny and make a living out of it,"" she wrote on Instagram. ""It wasn't always likely but we did it and I am glad we got to do a scene together. Thank you xx.""
Comedian and TV presenter Matt Lucas said he was ""so sad"" to hear of MacIntosh's death.
""We were lucky enough to have him appear in Little Britain,"" he said. ""He was sweet and smart and humble and, of course, brilliantly funny.""
Actor Rufus Jones, who directed and wrote comedy TV series Home, called MacIntosh an ""absolute pleasure of a guy"".
""A familiar and hilarious member of the Edinburgh sketch scene when we all started, and went on to create one of the most iconic scene stealers in tv comedy history,"" he wrote on X.
MacIntosh, who attended Edinburgh University and was actively involved in its comedy troupe, performed at the Fringe Festival in 2007 as part of a double act with Tim FitzHigham.
In 2009, he appeared in a charity music video for Chris Rea's Driving Home for Christmas alongside other celebrities.
TV personality Lizzy Cundy shared a tribute to MacIntosh on X, writing: ""We were great mates and we danced together in Chris Rea's Driving Home for Christmas video. Such a lovely man inside and out.""
TV channel Gold tweeted: ""We loved him as Keith in The Office and were lucky enough to work with him over the years on the channel. Our thoughts go out to his family and friends at such a difficult time.""
MacIntosh's friend Ed Scott said: ""He may have had a famous face known by millions as Keith from The Office but the person inside is what I will most remember.
""Ewen was so full of empathy, kindness, and integrity and above all a really good man.""
MacIntosh's cause of death has not been confirmed, but he died at Willow Green Care Home in Darlington.
Scott said: ""Thanks to the incredible care and love provided by the wonderful medical staff and especially the nurses who all loved him when he brought a smile to their days.""
The actor's agency Just Right Management said there would be a private cremation for family and close friends, and a celebratory memorial service later in the year.

2024-03-11T11:01:05.000Z,Israel reveals Eurovision song after weeks of wrangling,BBC News,"Israel has unveiled its revised entry for the Eurovision Song Contest, after the original version was rejected for its perceived political overtones.
Eden Golan will now sing Hurricane, a rewritten version of October Rain, which was thought to reference the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel.
The soaring, impassioned piano ballad premiered on Israeli TV on Sunday.
The lyrics now told the story of a woman experiencing a personal crisis, said Israel's public broadcaster, Kan.
The European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which organises Eurovision, rejected October Rain last month.
Lyrics such as ""There's no air left to breathe,"" and ""They were all good children, each one of them,"" were seen as references to the victims of Hamas's deadly attack, which triggered Israel's current ground offensive in Gaza.
Kan initially refused to change the song, saying it would prefer to withdraw from the contest - but Israel's President, Isaac Herzog, later called for ""necessary adjustments"" to ensure the country could participate.
The broadcaster said: ""The president emphasised that at this time in particular, when those who hate us seek to push aside and boycott the state of Israel from every stage, Israel must sound its voice with pride and its head high and raise its flag in every world forum, especially this year.""
Musically, Hurricane is the same song as October Rain - but the lyrics are now more general, with phrases such as ""Every day, I'm losing my mind"" and ""I'm still broken from this hurricane.""
As expected, the phrase ""October rain"" has been excised completely.
Another significant change is the word ""flowers"" has been replaced by ""powers"". According to the Israel Hayom newspaper, the former is often used to denote Israel's war fatalities.
The spoken-word section, which Golan delivers in Hebrew, has also been altered. The original references to poisoned air and dead children have been switched for the more generic: ""No need for big words, only prayers. Even if it's hard to see, you always leave me one small light.""
As the song was revealed, Golan, 20, addressed the difficulty of representing Israel at such a politically sensitive time.
""I ended up in a not simple year,"" she told the Times of Israel.
""But on the other hand, I even more so want to represent the country this year, because of its meaning - it has a totally different significance.
""And we can bring everything we're feeling, and everything the country is going through, in those three minutes. To speak through the song to the world.""
Israel has won Euorvision four times since its first appearance, in 1973. Last year, it was represented by pop sensation Noa Kirel, whose acrobatic dance number Unicorn placed third.
But the country has faced serious opposition to its participation in this year's contest, due to concerns over the humanitarian cost of the war in Gaza.
Last week, Belgium's French-speaking Culture Minister, Benedicte Linard, called for Israel to be banned as long as the war continued.
""Just like Russia has been excluded from competitions and Eurovision following its invasion of Ukraine, Israel should be excluded until it puts an end to its flagrant violations of international law, which are causing thousands of victims, especially children,"" she wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.
Israel insists its ground offensive is in line with international law. Its military has repeatedly said it goes out of its way to try to avoid harming civilians.
Ms Linard also told parliament on Wednesday she would ask public broadcaster Radio-télévision belge de la Communauté française (RTBF), which is organising Belgium's entry to Eurovision, to voice the concerns to the EBU.
Her Flemish counterpart, Benjamin Dalle, said an Israeli suspension would be appropriate while so many Palestinian civilians were suffering, according to Flemish broadcaster VRT.
Musicians in several countries have also called for Israel to be suspended from the contest. Before he was selected to represent the UK, Olly Alexander also endorsed a statement accusing Israel of genocide.
An Israeli official later told the UK's Daily Telegraph newspaper the arguments were ""absurd"" and accused Alexander and his fellow signatories of ""anti-Israel bias"".
Israel launched an air and ground campaign in Gaza after Hamas's 7 October attacks, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 253 taken hostage.
More than 30,800 people have been killed in Gaza since then, the territory's Hamas-run Health Ministry says.

Oh, and there was also a giraffe.
Singer-songwriter Raye reflected on her record-breaking nominations, saying: ""I've got tears in my eyes already, I've got waterproof eyeliner on.""
She said all she had ever wanted was to be ""an albums artist"".
Six-time Brits winner and triple nominee Dua Lipa smouldered in a fitted, black leather sculpted dress by Donatella Versace.
She said she loves to ""add a little bit of danger to my performances"", and that ""it's all just about having fun and creating a spectacle"".
She opened the show with her new song Training Season.
Becky Hill, who was up for best dance act, opted for a black outfit which skimmed her upper half while swathing her legs in flowing material. She said she hoped Raye would have the ""record-breaking, history making evening she deserves"".
Abigail Morris from The Last Dinner Party, winners of the Brits Rising Star award and the BBC's Sound of 2024 competition, let her dress do the talking.
She told the BBC it's a line from one of their songs, explaining: ""I thought it was appropriate for tonight.""
Years and Years singer Olly Alexander, who is this year's UK Eurovision entrant with his song Dizzy, looked dashing in a long silk jacket.
It wouldn't be the Brits without at least one unusual outfit, and comic Rob Beckett obliged by climbing inside an inflatable giraffe. Let's hope he sits at the back so he doesn't block anyone's view.
Charli XCX was as colourful as the Brits logo board behind her, in a dress made from a patchwork of colours and materials with a resin bodice.
Musician Jacob Collier, who is known for wearing colourful outfits, opted for oversized neon silk, with flowing purple trousers.
Tré Cool and Billie Joe Armstrong of Green Day also went for black as their key outfit colour.
Ella Henderson stood out from the crowd in a huge, black hat - she's nominated for React, along with Switch Disco.
One of the show's presenters, Maya Jama, channelled her inner mermaid in a sweeping black, corseted dress.
Another host, Clara Amfo, wore emerald green with fishnet tights and platform shoes.
Singer Jess Glynne looked regal in pink and crimson, with strong eye makeup to match.
Singer Rebecca Ferguson, who performed in Liverpool at one of last year's Eurovision semi-finals, said she was excited to see multi-nominated artist Raye perform at the Brits.
She also spoke about raising awareness for a new independent body aimed at helping prevent and tackle bullying and harassment in the music industry - the Creative Industries Independent Standards Authority,

2024-03-12T09:23:35.000Z,Oscars 2024: Al Pacino explains awkward best picture announcement,BBC News,"Al Pacino has explained why he did not read out the names of all 10 best picture nominees at the Oscars, saying the show's producers made the decision.
The veteran actor handed out the final trophy of the night, at Sunday's star-studded event in Los Angeles.
But there was confusion when he abruptly announced the winner as Oppenheimer without first listing the nominees, as is customary.
""It was not my intention to omit them,"" Pacino said in a statement.
Instead, the 83 year old said, it was ""a choice by the producers not to have [the nominees] said again since they were highlighted individually throughout the ceremony"".
In his statement, which was issued on Monday afternoon, the Oscar-winning actor added that he ""chose to follow"" the way the producers wanted the award to be presented.
""I realise being nominated is a huge milestone in one's life and to not be fully recognised is offensive and hurtful,"" Pacino said.
""I say this as someone who profoundly relates with film-makers, actors and producers so I deeply empathise with those who have been slighted by this oversight and it's why I felt it necessary to make this statement.""
Pacino's announcement meant the night ended on a confusing note, with none of the usual fanfare around the night's biggest prize.
Opening the envelope, he mumbled ""my eyes see 'Oppenheimer',"" leaving the audience momentarily confused as to whether the film had actually won.
BBC Culture reporter Emma Saunders, who was at the event in Los Angeles, said his announcement ""had people sitting up in their chairs"" as they tried to parse the information.
While it wasn't on the scale of the chaos at the end of the 2017 awards, when Moonlight and La La Land were mixed up for the best picture award, she said it gave reporters backstage ""a panic attack right at the end of the ceremony"".
Speaking about the presentation of the award in Variety, Oscars producer, Molly McNearney, said the decision to jump straight to the winner was made because ""we were very worried that the show was going to be long"".
McNearney, who is married to Oscars host Jimmy Kimmel, added: ""By the time you get to the end of the show, you've seen all 10 best picture clip packages.
""People just want to hear who wins, and they're pretty ready for the show to be over. At least that's what we anticipated. So, we did not give him a clip package. We did not give him nominations to read.""
Addressing Pacino, she apologised if the decision ""put him in a tough spot"".
""That made it a little confusing. But listen, that's the excitement of live television. You never know you're going to get exactly!""
The 10 films nominated for best picture were American Fiction, Anatomy of a Fall, Barbie, The Holdovers, Killers of the Flower Moon, Maestro, Oppenheimer, Past Lives, Poor Things and The Zone of Interest.
Oppenheimer swept the ceremony, winning best picture, best actor for Cillian Murphy, best director for Christopher Nolan, and best supporting actor for Robert Downey Jr.
An estimated 19.5 million people tuned in to watch Sunday night's 96th Academy Awards, according to broadcaster ABC.
That's the highest figure in four years, and nearly double the pandemic-era low. However, the ratings are still disappointing for a ceremony that regularly pulled in more than 40 million viewers a decade ago.
This year's Oscar nominations included smash hits like Barbie and Oppenheimer, that the public had actually seen, compared to the more esoteric and art-house films that dominated nominations at recent ceremonies. The Academy also moved the show an hour earlier this year, which may have helped to boost ratings.
Pacino, an acting legend, won the Oscar for best actor in 1993 for Scent of a Woman.

2024-03-11T02:55:31.000Z,Zone of Interest director Jonathan Glazer makes Gaza statement in Oscars speech,BBC News,"Director Jonathan Glazer focused on the war in Gaza in his acceptance speech at the Oscars, saying he refuted his ""Jewishness and the Holocaust being hijacked by an occupation"".
His film about Auschwitz and the Holocaust - The Zone of Interest - won the best international film award.
Glazer said those killed in both Israel and Gaza were victims of ""dehumanisation"".
Celebrities, including Billie Eilish, also wore pins calling for a ceasefire.
The awards night started slightly later than planned on Sunday, after protesters, also demanding a ceasefire, blocked traffic outside the venue.
US media reported that around 1,000 people took part in the demonstration outside the Dolby Theatre. A cascade of limousines heading towards the venue were blocked by the protesters, with some stars - including Killers of the Flower Moon star Lily Gladstone - being forced to abandon their vehicles.
Glazer said it was an ""honour"" to win the award - the UK's first win for the category. The German-language film, which earned a total of five Oscar nominations, focuses on the family of Auschwitz's longest-serving commandant, Rudolf Höss.
Höss ran the Auschwitz concentration camp between 1940 and 1943. An estimated 1.1 million people were murdered there - one million of whom were Jews.
After thanking those who worked with him on the film, Glazer - reading from a pre-written speech - said: ""All our choices were made to reflect and confront us in the present, not to say look what they did then, rather what we do now.
""Our film shows where dehumanisation leads at its worst. It's shaped all of our past and present.""
The director, who is Jewish, added: ""Right now, we stand here as men who refute their Jewishness and the Holocaust being hijacked by an occupation which has led to conflict for so many innocent people.
""Whether the victims of October 7th in Israel, or the ongoing attack on Gaza, all the victims of this dehumanisation, how do we resist?""
Palestinians in the West Bank and eastern Jerusalem have lived under Israeli occupation since 1967.
The director previously told the BBC that his film ""looks into dark corners of human capacity"", and is relevant today.
""I think what's inside this film is what we do to each other as human beings,"" he said. ""We see others as lesser than ourselves, different from ourselves. Somehow, step by step, that leads to atrocity.""
Singer Billie Eilish, actor Mark Ruffalo and Poor Things star Ramy Youssef were among celebrities wearing a pin on the red carpet calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.
The pin-wearing followed an open letter to US President Joe Biden signed by nearly 400 artists.
Some of the signatories include Bradley Cooper and America Ferrera, who were both nominated for awards this year.
Some 1,200 people were killed after Hamas gunmen attacked communities in southern Israel on 7 October. They took around 250 hostages back into the Gaza Strip, with many still alive and being held there.
Israel responded with a massive bombardment and invasion of Gaza, which it said would destroy Hamas. More than 30,900 people have been killed in Gaza since then, the territory's Hamas-run health ministry says.
The UN has warned that famine in the Gaza Strip is ""almost inevitable"" and children are starving to death.

2024-03-03T07:01:29.000Z,Brit Awards 2024: The real winners and losers,BBC News,"This year's Brit Awards are destined for the history books - with pop star Raye winning six trophies, including best artist, best song and album of the year.
""Will it ever get better than this?"" the overwhelmed 26-year-old asked backstage. ""What is even happening?""
But there's always more to the Brits than the awards themselves.
On a night of tears, beers and celebrating careers, who were the real winners and losers at the O2 Arena?
Six Brit awards in one night is astonishing.
David Bowie only got six in his entire career. George Michael got three. Adele, the biggest British artist of the last decade, has a dozen.
In other words, Raye is officially half an Adele.
Raye's record-breaking haul is all the sweeter because two years ago she was a self-described ""down-and-out"" in the music industry.
Prevented from releasing music by a record label that didn't believe in her, she had to fight for her freedom, finally going independent in 2022.
Since then, her career has exploded: Escapism, a song written in the depths of despair then rejected by her label, became a monster hit. A UK number one, it was the biggest-selling song by a British female artist in 2023 and went platinum all over the world.
Tonight, it won song of the year, proving that success really is the sweetest revenge.
""This has been the best night of my life,"" Raye told us afterwards. ""And luckily they got it all on camera so I can watch it back.""
See above.
Last year, an American pop artist called Taylor Swift had a pretty successful run. Sold a few records, played a few concerts, dated a footballer. You might have heard about it.
So it was a shock to the Swifties when actress Joanne Froggatt opened the envelope marked ""best international artist"" and read out someone else's name: Missouri-born R&B singer SZA.
But the shock was short-lived. This was no David-beats-Goliath moment.
SZA's second album, SOS, is a modern masterpiece: A 23-track opus where she dissects love from every conceivable angle, hopping nimbly between genres and delivering gorgeous, jazzy vocal runs that blur the lines between rapping and singing.
If anything, the Brits did a better job here than this year's Grammys, where SZA had more nominations than any other artist, but was shut out of all the main categories.
Best pop nominee Charli XCX turned up with a hard resin bustier that she had to clutch to her midriff all night, in case she did a Janet Jackson and flashed the audience.
The custom Marni outfit also made eating the slap-up Brits dinner somewhat impractical.
""When I have to sit down, it rises up to my throat,"" she said. ""It's not great.""
But all the discomfort was worth it.
""This is the part that I care about. The look. Does any of the rest really matter? I don't know. Whatever.""
Here's something you might not know: Joe Keery, aka Stranger Things' Steve Harrington, currently has a top 10 single in the UK.
End Of The Beginning, a dreamy indie-rock song he recorded under the pseudonym Djo two years ago, has suddenly gone viral - earning him a seat at the Brit Awards.
But while he was happy to talk about his music, he was sworn to secrecy on the next (and final) season of Stranger Things.
""I have seen the scripts and that is all I can tell you,"" he said. ""I have received some papers with words written on them that may or may not involve anyone I know.
""Anything more, I can't say.""
Not since Jarvis Cocker waved his posterior at Michael Jackson has the Brits seen such depravity.
As Clara Amfo was introducing a performance from Rema, the Dublin-born singer CMAT shuffled into the back of her shot, and turned around to reveal what you might euphemistically call her ""Irish craic"".
US punk rockers Green Day attended the Brits to present the best British group award.
But the show's co-host Roman Kemp managed to land a subtle dig at the band as they took to the stage.
""To present our next award for British group are two genuine rock gods,"" he said. ""They have sold over 75 million records and released 14 albums... They are very much the American Busted.""
If only the rest of the dull, lifeless script had been this eager to ruffle feathers.
Kylie won the Brits' Global Icon Award - a lifetime achievement prize without the cruel ""your career's seen better days"" subtext.
She celebrated with a career-spanning medley of hits including Padam Padam, Can't Get You Out Of My Head, Love At First Sight and All The Lovers.
Appearing on a plinth high above the audience, she went through four costume changes, serving moves like a choreographical vending machine.
Best of all, she seemed to be having the time of her life - running down the catwalk and high-fiving her dancers with a big, exuberant grin.
Like her Glastonbury performance five years ago, it was a reminder of why she's so beloved.
Other performers want you to see the effort, the sweat and the tears. Kylie just shimmers.
Mistaking the Brit Awards for Royal Ascot, Ella Henderson turned up in a voluminous chapeau, which she then insisted on wearing throughout the ceremony.
And what about the people sitting behind her?
""I'll turn around and tell them what's going on,"" she laughed.
It's uncharitable to bring it up again, but Dua Lipa's first ever Brits performance back in 2018 was so stilted that it spawned the ""go girl, give us nothing"" meme.
She's since described the scrutiny as ""really painful"".
""I was like, 'I'm finally getting to do something that I love to do, and I'm being shut down, that I just can't seem to do anything right,'"" she told Rolling Stone.
Dua's been proving the haters wrong ever since - but her opening performance at this year's Brits was one for the ages: Dressed in a cropped leather jacket and shorts, she strutted down the catwalk towards a rotating tower of male dancers.
Then she was hoisted into the air by two acrobats, with nary a quiver in her voice, before landing back onstage to finish the song.
In a night filled with eye-catching and creative performances (shout outs to Rema, Tate McRae and Becky Hill), this was a stand-out.
Did someone put sedatives in the champagne? The atmosphere in the O2 was as dead as a doornail hammered into a Dodo and buried in a concrete bunker.
The TV audience was not impressed.
""There's something very icky about this years' #BritAwards,"" wrote Keiran Maddison on X. ""The vibes are so off and the crowd is so dead.""
""Is there even anyone in the audience?"" asked Hayley Davies.
""Bring back the days when everyone was well oiled and being rock stars,"" concluded Ally Fothers.
Next year, maybe put the fans at the front and the industry tables somewhere else. Like the car park.
The Brits scriptwriters were oddly fixated on drinking jokes - almost as if they were trying to will a Brandon Block moment into existence.
Roman Kemp even challenged Calvin Harris (who is teetotal) to down a shot, before revealing a bottle labelled ""Harry Styles bathwater"".
""I call it the Saltburn,"" he winked, in reference to a scene from a film that I won't describe if you haven't seen it.
Later, Kemp persuaded Kylie Minogue to do a ""shoey"", in the Australian tradition of drinking a beer from a shoe.
""Do I do this?"" she asked the crowd, who howled in approval.
Kemp duly poured some of Kylie's signature sparkling rosé* into a high heel, before they both took a generous sip.
Co-host Maya Jama then informed the audience that Kemp had athlete's foot, which would have been a decent joke if only they'd been drinking from one of his shoes.
(*It has been brought to the BBC's attention that the drink came from an unmarked can, which could therefore have contained any number of beverages, up to and including Vimto).
Twenty years after forming, Bring Me The Horizon won their first ever Brit Award, for best rock/alternative act.
Onstage, frontman Oli Sykes suggested their victory over bands like Blur, Young Fathers and the Rolling Stones was all down to a technicality.
""Cheers to the Brits for making the voting system so complicated only our fans could be arsed,"" he joked.
Backstage, the band were just as deadpan. Asked what he planned to do with his trophy, Sykes replied: ""I think it'll be a very useful doorstop for the coming summer months.
""With global warming and that, we'll have to prop the door open to let some of that heat escape.""
Raye's last award of the night was the biggest: Album of the year, for her genre-hopping debut My 21st Century Blues.
For her final speech at the podium, she brought up her grandmother, Agatha, for moral support.
""She raised me,"" explained the singer (whose middle name is Agatha) backstage.
""My parents worked full-time so she came from Ghana to come and raise us, she lived with us, she took us to and from school, and she poured so much love and heart into us"".
What a woman.

Wootton was suspended by the channel in September after comments by Laurence Fox about a female journalist prompted 8,867 complaints to the watchdog.
Ofcom's ruling, published on Monday, said Fox's remarks ""were clearly and unambiguously misogynistic"".
Wootton said he had left GB News to launch his own independent platform.
He said it would not be regulated by the ""Ofcommunist censors"", adding: ""Yesterday's chilling Ofcom report clearly raises far bigger issues.""
In its statement on Tuesday, the TV channel said: ""Dan Wootton joined GB News before its launch and was a part of the first on-air line up.
""Dan is no longer employed by GB News and we thank him for his contribution and wish him well with his future endeavours.""
On the 26 September episode of Dan Wootton Tonight, Fox made remarks about journalist Ava Evans that Ofcom has concluded were sexist, misogynistic and offensive.
Fox, an actor turned politician, drew condemnation after asking what ""self-respecting man"" would ""climb into bed"" with her, during a live show.
Wootton could be seen smiling and laughing throughout Fox's remarks, before adding for ""a touch of balance"" that Evans had qualified her comments, and called her a ""very beautiful woman"".
On Monday, Ofcom said Fox's remarks ""constituted a highly personal attack on Ms Evans and were potentially highly offensive to viewers"", adding that the comments ""were clearly and unambiguously misogynistic"".
""[The comments] reduced her contribution to a broadcast discussion on mental health - in her professional capacity as a political journalist - to a judgment on whether she, or women like her who publicly expressed their political opinions, were sexually desirable to men,"" Ofcom said in its ruling.
Ofcom added that Wootton's reaction and limited challenge ""did not mitigate the potential for offence"" and instead ""exacerbated it by contributing to the narrative in which a woman's value was judged by her physical appearance"".
It added that ""no apology was made after the interview with Mr Fox in the remainder of the two-hour programme - nor were any other editorial techniques used to address the potential for offence"".
The broadcasting regulator also said it had ""significant concerns about GB News' editorial control of its live output"" and told the channel to ""provide further detailed information about its compliance practices in this area"".
In his response, Wootton hit out at the watchdog, writing: ""How can any broadcaster or publisher truly stand for freedom of expression when state goons have the power to decide what you are and are not allowed to say on air?""
He added: ""It's not broadcasters who should be fearful of a carpeting from Ofcom: it's Ofcom that should be summoned in by this supposedly Conservative government to be reined in.""
Following the original comments, GB News suspended both presenters from the channel and said the insults were ""totally unacceptable"". Fox was sacked a week later.
The publisher of the MailOnline also announced it had sacked Wootton, who had written a column for the newspaper since 2021, ""following events this week"".

2024-02-21T08:10:29.000Z,The Beatles: Sir Sam Mendes to direct four films - one about each band member,BBC News,"Director Sir Sam Mendes is to make four separate films about The Beatles - one from each band member's perspective.
Sir Paul McCartney, Sir Ringo Starr and the families of John Lennon and George Harrison have all granted permission and music rights for the four films.
The Oscar-winning director said he was ""honoured to be telling the story of the greatest rock band of all time"".
He added that he was ""excited to challenge the notion of what constitutes a trip to the movies"".
The films, made by Sony Pictures and Sir Sam's Neal Street Productions, will be released in cinemas in 2027.
It is not clear whether the four films will be released at once or have a staggered rollout, but Sony said they would have an ""innovative release cadence"" which would be announced at a later date.
The project marks the first time that The Beatles and their company Apple Corps have granted full life story and music rights for a scripted film, according to a statement.
Sir Sam has previously directed films such as 1917, American Beauty, Revolutionary Road, Empire of Light and two James Bond movies - Skyfall and Spectre.
The Beatles are widely considered the greatest British band of all time thanks to a string of classic albums such as Rubber Soul, Revolver, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and Abbey Road.
Their best known hits include Yesterday, Hey Jude, A Hard Day's Night, Eight Days A Week, Let It Be, Come Together, Here Comes The Sun, Twist and Shout, Love Me Do and Help!
The majority of their songs were written by Lennon and McCartney. Harrison was often said to have felt frustrated that his own compositions were not given equal weight by his bandmates.
Last year, the Beatles released what was described as their ""final song"". John Lennon started the song, titled Now and Then, in 1978, but it could not be completed until software advances allowed the remaining band-members to extract his vocals from a rough demo cassette.
The track topped the UK singles chart in November, making the Beatles the act with the longest gap between their first and last number ones.
Apple Corps said the four new films would ""explore each Beatle's unique story and to bring them together in a suitably captivating and innovative way"".
Producer Dame Pippa Harris said: ""We intend this to be a uniquely thrilling, and epic cinematic experience.... To have The Beatles' and Apple Corps' blessing to do this is an immense privilege.""
The Beatles are no strangers to the silver screen, starring in several of their own films back in the 1960s - from the madcap comedy of A Hard Day's Night to the surreal psychedelia of Yellow Submarine.
Post break-up, they inspired dozens of feature-length tributes, from Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (a disastrously garish musical starring the Bee Gees) to the touching coming-of-age tale I Wanna Hold Your Hand.
The latter, which followed a group of teens trying to gain entry to the Beatles' seminal performance on Ed Sullivan's TV show, marked the directorial debut of Back To The Future's Robert Zemeckis. And he's not the only big-name director to be seduced by the Fab Four's allure.
Peter Jackson's epic, four-part documentary Get Back repurposed footage shot during the recording of the band's final album; Martin Scorcese put together a revelatory documentary about ""quiet Beatle"" George Harrison in 2011; while Sam Taylor-Johnson dramatised John Lennon's early life in the stark-but-compelling Nowhere Boy.
Danny Boyle's Yesterday imagined a world where everyone forgets The Beatles, except for one struggling musician who takes credit for all their songs (hilarity ensues).
And Julie Taymor's Across The Universe used the band's music as the backdrop for a 1960s romcom that featured Bono in a very peculiar moustache singing I Am The Walrus. It was very, very not good.
Perhaps the best of the bunch is 1994's Backbeat - an independent film, directed by Iain Softley, that told the story of The Beatles' pre-fame days in Hamburg. By focusing largely on the story of the band's original bassist, Stuart Sutcliffe, it was unencumbered by the colossal cultural baggage of the band's subsequent output.
Coincidentally, Backbeat was turned into a novel by music journalist Alan Clayson - who later published a four-volume box set, telling the Beatles' story from the perspective of each individual band member. Sound familiar?
Still, Clayson's unauthorised biographies - with their tales of infidelity and drug use - are unlikely to be the starting point for Mendes' films, which have been rubber-stamped by the almighty Beatles Corporation.
But if there's any lesson from those books, it's that George Harrison and Sir Ringo Starr's volumes are much more compelling, simply because we're less familiar with the story beats.
Perhaps the biggest question is, can Mendes fix it so that each of his Beatles films will synch up when they're played simultaneously, like The Wizard Of Oz and Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon?
Because that would really be worth a ticket to ride. Or four.
Correction: An earlier version of this story credited the story of Backbeat to Alan Clayson. The film was written by Iain Softley,  Michael Thomas and Stephen Ward. Clayson's book was a novelisation of the screenplay.

2024-02-20T17:42:29.000Z,A brilliant dancer and a lovely man: Your memories of Strictly's Robin Windsor,BBC News,"Tributes have flooded in for former Strictly Come Dancing professional Robin Windsor following his death at the age of 44.
Fans who watched and met the dancer have been getting in touch with the BBC to share their memories of him.
Jennifer Podesta recalled joining dance classes that he took at a holiday resort in St Lucia about five years ago.
""We had several chances to partner with him and given special attention,"" she said.
""We especially remember his helping us with his thoroughly enjoyable choreography to the Charleston, and his laughing at my husband's incorrect timing and kicking me in the shins! We all shared a great giggle. He was always down to earth and approachable.
""What sad news his life has ended far too soon. It's the world's loss of a great performer, teacher, choreographer and a 'real person'.""
Another fan, Sarah, also received tuition from the star in St Lucia.
""He was capable of dancing at a Strictly standard, but he gave each hopeless student the patience, generosity and fun of the dance - it was utterly joyful,"" she said.
""He was also a complete professional throughout, treating every dance we did in that island beach hut like it was a final performance. There was never any judgement of our abilities - just learning, progress and fun.
""This was an example of a proper teacher, a lovely person, and quite frankly someone gorgeous to behold too. I feel for his family that have lost their star.""
Chrissy Webb (above) took part in a masterclass that Windsor led on a Strictly Come Dancing-themed cruise in 2016.
""The floor was packed with fellow passengers keen to learn. He was so enthusiastic, patient and encouraging to all abilities, beginners and experienced alike.
""I was lucky enough to have a short dance with him, one which I treasure. He was a shining star and will be sorely missed.""
Jill Marshall danced along in her kitchen during classes that Windsor held online during Covid. ""He kept us all happy and fit during a very difficult time,"" she remembered.
""Sometimes the class would stop whilst Robin let Luka his dog out of the kitchen door. We felt he was our friend.""
Mia Longman (above) appeared alongside Windsor in panto in Lowestoft, Suffolk, at Christmas. ""Our cast and crew can honestly say he absolutely made the pantomime,"" she wrote.
Windsor played the genie in Aladdin. ""He brought so much light, magic and fun to the run - a real life genie, you could say.
""He was such a selfless, generous and loving person who will be deeply missed by all. Thank you for leaving a bit of sparkle with me and with many others. Rest in peace Robin and keep dancing.""
Ann Bevan was watching Windsor on stage alongside Kristina Rihanoff, Kara Tointon and Artem Chigvintsev in their show Dance To The Music in 2012 in Bristol when she was called up on stage for some audience participation.
""Robin was so hot, all the fake tan was running down his face and was staining his white shirt, but he didn't seem to care,"" she said.
""I had to copy the moves he did and finally, after being voted through by the audience noise-o-meter, I had to make up an impromptu dance to music I had not heard previously, encouraged on by Robin, and I won the next noise-o-meter vote.""
She added: ""Fond memories at this sad time. So sorry to hear of his passing at such an early age. He was a talented dancer with a friendly and infectious disposition. A sad loss to the world of dance.""
Mini Biswas (above), from London, met him at a tech event in November. ""He had this warm positive energy about him, and watching him perform live at the event showcased how brilliant he is, making dancing fun for all in the room! Gone too soon, rest in peace Robin.""
Meanwhile, Clare Moat saw him perform alongside fellow Strictly dancers in Here Come The Boys at the London Palladium in 2021.
""It was the first show we saw after Covid,"" she said. ""We had a wonderful time. He was a brilliant dancer and a lovely man. My heart and prayers go out to his family and friends. RIP Robin, we'll miss you.""
Fans and friends have also been paying tribute on social media.

2024-02-28T11:18:48.000Z,Kanye West: Rapper Ye sued by Donna Summer's estate over copyright,BBC News,"Kanye West is being sued by Donna Summer's estate for allegedly using an uncleared sample of her music on his new album.
Court documents show that the Queen of Disco's estate denied Kanye's request to sample the 1977 hit I Feel Love.
West has become a controversial figure in recent years - comments he has made have been heavily criticised as far right or antisemitic.
The rapper has not yet commented on the legal action taken by Summer's estate.
A sample of I Feel Love was used on his track Good (Don't Die).
The song appeared on his album Vultures 1 earlier this month, but has since been removed from streaming services.
An attorney for Summer's estate claims an entity called Alien Music, representing West, approached him on 31 January, a week before the release of the rapper's album, to request clearance to sample the disco hit.
The request was denied as the estate said there could be a ""potential degradation to Summer's legacy"" as ""West is known as a controversial public figure whose conduct has led numerous brands and business partners to disassociate from him"".
The attorney claims the rapper attempted to use a soundalike of the song instead of the original to get around the denied request, but he says it is still copyright infringement.
Following the release of the album, Summer's estate says it contacted streaming services requesting the song be removed.
The album was removed a few days later and re-uploaded without the track. However, the lawsuit claims the song has harmed the estate as it was streamed millions of times.
The lawsuit, filed against the 46-year-old rapper, his record label and collaborator Ty Dolla $ign, is asking for damages and an injunction to block further distribution of the song.
The singer, who died of lung cancer in 2012, is best known for hits including Love to Love You Baby and Hot Stuff.
The BBC has also asked Giorgio Moroder, who co-write and produced I Feel Love, for comment on the case.
Summer is not the only artist to recently deny sample requests by Kanye.
Earlier in February, Ozzy Osbourne blocked Kanye from sampling a 1983 live version of Black Sabbath's Iron Man on his Vultures 1 album.
Despite denying the request, Kanye allegedly used a sample of the song during a listening party for the new album.
However, the sample was not used in the final version of his song, Carnival which debuted at number one on the US Billboard's Streaming Songs chart.
The rock artist, 75, said he denied the request as he believed Kanye was ""an anti-Semite"".
In an interview after the release of the track, Osbourne's wife, TV personality Sharon Osbourne said that in recent times Kanye ""represents hate"".
Kanye, now known as Ye, was banned from Twitter in December 2022 over offensive tweets. He was restored on the account eight months later.
Following anti-Semitic comments on social media, Adidas, who produce the US rapper's Yeezy trainers, cut ties with him.
The singer-songwriter first rose to fame in 2004 and has sold 160 million records since.

2024-02-29T11:58:14.000Z,Standing at the Sky's Edge: Sheffield musical 'reminds us of what we've lost',BBC News,"Musician Richard Hawley has said a Sheffield-based stage musical which has just transferred to London's West End has been successful because it ""reminds us of things we've lost"".
Standing at the Sky's Edge, featuring songs written by Hawley, opened at the Gillian Lynne Theatre on Wednesday.
The show spans seven decades, following different generations of residents in Sheffield's Park Hill council estate.
Hawley said it had been an ""incredible journey"" to reach the West End.
The show was first staged at Sheffield's Crucible Theatre in 2019, attracting rave reviews for its realistic depiction of complex social and political issues.
The Covid-19 pandemic halted its initial momentum, but the show later opened at the National Theatre before finally transferring to the West End.
""In all honesty, as much faith as I had in the musical, I guess I didn't really have much faith in people, in a way, that it would be attended by so many human beings,"" Hawley told BBC News.
""And the way that things are in our country in particular, I never thought it would leave the inside of my head, let alone all the way to the West End, it's incredible. It's kind of changed my thinking.""
He reflected: ""I think the musical has somehow touched a nerve, there's something about it that reminds us of things that we've lost, and I think the timing of it perhaps, with the state of things in our country at the moment, I think it's tapped into something that I think collectively everyone's thinking.""
Written by Chris Bush, the show focuses on three core stories, all of which depict tales of aspiration as the residents dream of a better life.
Three families are seen occupying a particular flat at different periods over six decades - a steel family hit hard by Thatcherism, a family of Liberian refugees, and a middle-class young woman who has fled north following a relationship break-up.
Northern working-class culture is put under the microscope as the residents' struggles to achieve their goals. The obstacles each of them faces range from internal family tensions to external political forces.
""There's anger here about the Thatcherite destruction of northern industry but also ambivalence about Cool Britannia-style urban regenerations that involve social cleansing,"" noted Nick Curtis of the Evening Standard when the show played at the National Theatre.
But while the backdrop and themes are political, Hawley explained he felt strongly that the show should not set out to lecture the audience.
""One of the conditions was I was absolutely adamant when we started this journey 12 years ago, that it must not be a grandstanding, soap box, beating-people-around-the-head, finger-wagging exercise,"" Hawley explained.
""I think ultimately it is a political statement, but all you have to do is tell the story. It's a fictionalisation of the somewhat dramatic events that happened at Park Hill flats in Sky Edge.
""But all I ever said, one of the very few conditions was to just let the story tell itself. We don't need to add to it our own personal opinions, the story does all the work for you really.""
Following its West End debut, Alex Wood of WhatsOnStage awarded the show five stars.
""Provoking fevered reactions - many audible gasps or sobs were heard after a variety of plot beats - while being resolutely, brazenly assured in its craft, makes Standing at the Sky's Edge a towering feat of contemporary musical theatre,"" Wood wrote.
""It stands as a shining tribute to the combined power of both popular music and stage storytelling, and subsidised and commercial theatre. Unmissable.""
Clive Davis of the Times was slightly less keen, describing the ""part musical, part soap opera"" combination as an ""odd hybrid in his three-star review.
""Weaving domestic incident around the history of Sheffield's Brutalist landmark, the Park Hill estate, this Olivier-winning show is a sincere if uneven love letter to the power of community,"" he said.
""There's certainly no shortage of passion in the performances, even if the script sometimes resembles a conscientiously assembled checklist of social issues,"" he added, noting ""an awful lot of incident is crammed into a confusing final quarter"".
Director Robert Hastie told BBC News it was a ""proud moment"" to have the show open in the West End, five years after its launch at the Sheffield Crucible, ""where you could see Park Hill, and see the neighbours we're making this show about"".
He added that while some physical changes had been made to the set to inhabit a bigger stage, few creative changes were needed to the show itself, and that lines of dialogue specific to the region had been kept in the script.
""There's a joke about Sheffield Wednesday and Sheffield United,"" he noted. ""But everywhere knows what it is to have to rival football teams, everywhere knows what it is to have the fabulous gay club that everybody knows and has had a daft night in.
""Not everybody might know what Henderson's Relish is,"" he laughed, ""but if you don't then you're missing out, and you should come to the show to find out why.""
Hawley agrees: ""The meat and potatoes of the whole thing are the same, the main thrust of the piece hasn't changed, but the interesting thing is a lot of the actors have changed because they weren't available or have moved on to other things.
""A couple of the new actors have put their own vibe on it, but I think that's natural, and the work itself can absorb that.""
The show's Park Hill estate is a Grade 2-listed piece of brutalist architecture which opened in 1961 as part of a post-war surge of council housing. But the fortunes of the estate have fluctuated over decades.
The show is also in the early stages of being adapted for television although it has not yet been confirmed which broadcaster or streamer will air it.
In a four-star review of the show when it played at the National, Sam Marlowe of the Stage described it as ""a triumphant tribute to all the unacknowledged battles fought and dreams pursued, all the tiny miracles of the everyday"".
""The show's texture is fantastically rich. Hawley's music is sweet and rough, woozy and boozy, wistful and enraged.""
The Guardian Arifa Akbar also awarded it four stars, writing: ""Ensemble numbers bring shivers. Feet tap, spines tingle. We find ourselves swaying in our seats. Together with its lovely movement, the show becomes unstoppably winning, ineffably exuberant.
And Fiona Mountford of iNews praised the show's universal themes. ""By talking about Sheffield, they encompass the whole world,"" she said in a five-star review.
""It's a bittersweet musical love letter to the city that reaches far beyond South Yorkshire to encompass a haunting meditation on the universal idea of home.""
Hawley attended the press night on Wednesday, but noted; ""There are scenes in it which I personally find distressing to watch, it's so close to the bone.
""My father was a steel worker, and all our community was destroyed by Margaret Thatcher and her government, so I lived through it.""
While he feels strongly the show should not preach a political message to the audience, Hawley argues that deep societal changes are needed so that differing ideologies and attitudes do not stand in the way of collaboration and progress.
He references a Louis de Bernieres book, Birds Without Wings, commenting: ""Whether you're left or right wing, one thing we know for certain is a bird never flew on one wing. We all need each other to fly.
""We cannot make it without each other, no matter who you are, we all need each other to make this a better place than it is now.
""We need to move on, get rid of negative thinking and start being a better set of human beings than we've been taught to be or led to believe. We are a much better country than that, and it's about time started behaving like it.""

Myers was known as one half of the much-loved TV cooking duo.
""Rest in peace, my love,"" Liliana Myers wrote on Facebook. ""My wonderful, brave man! Till next time we meet!""
More tributes have flooded in from those who worked with Myers and his TV partner Si King, and who they met on their motorcycle trips around the UK.
The pair travelled the country and the world over two decades to make much-loved shows about the food and people they found.
Their first series, 2006's The Hairy Bikers' Cookbook, was partly filmed in Romania - where Myers met his future wife, who was working in a hotel.
They kept in touch but didn't fall in love until she came to the UK to visit him on holiday a few years later.
Speaking in 2021, she recalled: ""I was blown away by one tiny little thing. He picked me up from the airport... It was about midnight and he opened the fridge and he said, 'What do you want me to cook for you?'
""I'd never ever in my life had a man cook for me. So that was the very first thing that just hit me. I was visiting as a friend, but from that moment on my heart just melted.""
Following Myers' death, tributes have also been paid by fellow TV chefs including Paul Hollywood, Nigella Lawson, Andi Oliver and James Martin, who described Myers as ""a very special man"".
Saturday Kitchen host Matt Tebbutt told BBC Radio 4's The World At One that he was ""one of the good ones"".
""He was an absolute joy to work with,"" Tebbutt said. ""He was just so down to earth, self deprecating, he was normal. There were no airs and graces.
""He was a genuinely lovely guy who genuinely enjoyed and loved what he did. I think that shines through in all the shows.
""The nation loved him because he was that bloke that you could relate to. Whether you saw him out in the shops or down the pub or wherever, he was just a normal, nice guy.""
Before finding fame, Myers worked as a BBC make-up artist for 23 years, specialising in prosthetics. He met King when they both worked on the set of 1995 period drama The Gambling Man.
Actor Robson Green was among the stars of that show. Green wrote on Instagram: ""David's warm smile, hearty laugh, and genuine love for people were not just the ingredients of his success but a reflection of his zest for life.
""His presence brightened our screens, and his heart and soul inspired all who knew him and many others to embrace the simple pleasures of sharing a meal with loved ones.""
TV journalist Pam Royle also knew Myers before he moved in front of the camera. ""Truly lovely man,"" she wrote on X.
""Enjoyed conversations with Dave in make up room at TyneTeesTV during filming of Catherine Cookson dramas. His prosthetic work was phenomenal.""
The Hairy Bikers also made an impression on the many people they met on their travels.
Matt Waldron, head chef at the Stackpole Inn in Pembrokeshire, which they visited for The Hairy Bikers Go Local, said he was ""such a genuinely nice bloke"".
""They had such a passion for food and travel,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""The infectious energy that they had, especially trying to support local producers and local restaurants, that was their key.""
Jo Williams, former head of Wilson's Endowed Primary School in Over Kellet in Lancashire, recalled the pair's visit in 2008.
""They made the children laugh, they were so giving of their time,"" she told BBC Radio Lancashire. ""He pushed his face against the glass and made silly faces at them to make them all giggle.
""And from that, he just became a friend of the school. The children would send them Christmas cards and they would reply. Dave in particular would send us texts and good wishes.""
Jimmy Butler, a pig farmer in Blythburgh, Suffolk, also hosted the Hairy Bikers, who sampled his wife's cooking ""and then we went out to the pigs, and they sat down in the mud"".
He told BBC Radio Suffolk: ""What I particularly liked about them was, whether they were on camera or off camera, there was absolutely no difference to them at all.
""The pair of them were just nice, friendly people with a terrific knowledge of cooking and the world. And they're just nice people to work with. Just a joy.""
Chef Tommy Banks echoed those feelings. ""I really enjoyed the times that I spent with Dave he always lit up a room,"" he wrote on Instagram.
""Such a genuine, kind and good person. Always so positive, even in the last few years. He really was one of the best and he will be sorely missed.""
Fellow chef Gennaro Contaldo wrote: ""Such a lovely man, I'm going to miss your smile and optimism.""
The Hairy Bikers' publishers Orion Books remembered Myers' ""infectious energy and passion for food and travel"".
""There was never a dull moment working with Dave, and all who were lucky enough to do so will attest to what a brilliantly inspiring and kind and hardworking man he was.""
Meanwhile, fans on social media said the Hairy Bikers had inspired them and their families to try more cooking.

Country singer LeAnn Rimes will also join Sir Tom Jones and Will.i.am as coaches on the reality singing contest.
Jones and Fletcher will jointly occupy the fourth spot, and will both have to agree in order to turn the chair.
The pair said being on The Voice was ""going to be epic"", adding they were ""ready for the challenge"".
The move follows in the footsteps of the US version of The Voice, which previously announced country duo Dan & Shay would jointly fill a chair.
The format of the show sees the coaches face away from the contestants - so they can judge them on the quality of their singing alone.
Then, if they want to mentor the singer to the next stage of the competition, they press the button on their chair - which spins it around and allows them to see and interact with the contestant.
The new coaches will replace singers Olly Murs and Anne-Marie, who left the series last year.
Jones, who won the most recent series of The Masked Singer, previously served as a coach on spin-off The Voice Kids for six series.
Emma Willis will return as host of the show, which offers hopeful singers the chance to win a record contract with music giants EMI, £50,000 in cash and a holiday to Universal Studios Florida.
In a statement, Fletcher and Jones said: ""To be making The Voice UK history as the first ever double chair combo is going to be epic and we're both ready for the challenge.
""And of course, we couldn't ask to be in greater company than our fellow Voice family members Emma, Will, Sir Tom and LeAnn. Roll on the talent!""
Rimes, who is best known for hits such as Can't Fight The Moonlight and How Do I Live, said she was ""truly excited and grateful"" to be joining ""an epic panel of coaches"".
""Being able to work with and nurture emerging, vibrant talent in the UK represents a new chapter of my heartfelt connection with the wonderful fans I've had deep ties with for decades,"" the Grammy-winning singer added.
""I'm looking forward to offering my heart and guidance, sharing what I've learned through my own musical journey, and discovering the extraordinary talent that the UK is renowned for.""

2024-03-08T11:46:37.000Z,One Day author David Nicholls' debut Starter For Ten becomes stage musical,BBC News,"Following the mammoth success of Netflix's One Day, author David Nicholls' debut novel Starter For Ten has now also been adapted - but in a very different way.
One month after One Day arrived on Netflix, Nicholls still seems somewhat stupefied by the reaction.
""It's been really... head-turning,"" he says, uncharacteristically searching for suitable words.
""I mean, I'm still in a bit of a daze. It's been a month now. It's taken us all by surprise.""
The writer's bittersweet love story was already a success story, having sold six million copies since being published in 2009, and being turned into a Hollywood film.
But the Netflix series, an instant hit with both viewers and critics, took things to another level.
""The fact that people have watched to the end and then gone back to the beginning and watched again, all of that has been profoundly exciting,"" the author says.
""I'm very happy and grateful to all the people who have then turned to the book as well.""
In Nicholls' storytelling universe, One Day couldn't exactly be described as a sequel to his 2003 novel Starter For Ten, but there are some inescapable connections.
Starter For Ten starts when Brian Jackson goes to university in 1985. He would leave in 1988 - the year Emma Morley and Dexter Mayhew also graduate in the opening of One Day.
There is ""definitely a continuity"", the author says. And there are similarities between English students Emma and Brian. Maybe they crossed paths.
""Emma Morley from One Day and Brian would probably have had a tentative friendship,"" he says. ""She would slightly roll her eyes at him, but they would have things in common.""
Now, Brian is the star of his own show, in a new theatre adaptation of Starter For Ten.
Whereas Netflix stayed pretty faithful to the charming romantic drama of One Day, the Starter For Ten stage show takes a different tack.
It is a musical that ramps up the comic energy and 80s kitsch. But it works.
""It's fantastic that it's been turned into another form,"" says Nicholls, speaking at Bristol's Old Vic theatre, where it is receiving its premiere. ""It's been a real surprise to me.""
In the Telegraph, theatre critic Dominic Cavendish's four-star review described it as ""a feel-good Brit hit that's surely bound for the West End"".
In a three-star review, The Stage's Rosemary Waugh said the show ""has the energy levels of a freshers' foam party and the cuteness of a first-term romance"" - but ""doesn't fulfil its promise"".
Starter For Ten follows Brian as he tries to fulfil his lifelong dream of appearing on TV quiz show University Challenge, while also facing challenges in love, friendships and family.
In 2006, the book was adapted as a film starring James McAvoy, Benedict Cumberbatch, James Corden and Catherine Tate.
The new musical's cast includes Mel Giedroyc, who is brilliant as both Brian's mum and the stern Margaret Thatcher-inspired University Challenge producer with a scene-stealing rock solo.
Co-writer Emma Hall says she and fellow writer and director Charlie Parham both read the book at university, and ""it so epitomised the student experience"".
""It just appealed to us in all of its hilarious, giddy, unvarnished glory.""
The story is ""like a classic sports narrative"", she explains. ""Except the sport is quizzing, and the goal is University Challenge. That is the World Cup of trivia.
""And along the way, it's all about growing up and falling in love with the wrong people and making mistakes.""
Coming up with songs to fit a coming-of-age story is one thing, but having to fit fiendish quiz questions into the lyrics was its own stern test.
""There is nothing quite like trying to make a University Challenge question into a lyric,"" Hall laughs.
""I can tell you, it's one of the most difficult things I've ever done, but incredibly satisfying once you get the knack.""
The location of the university was never specified in the original Starter For Ten book, but the film and now the stage show place it in Bristol, where Nicholls himself studied drama and English.
The author says the story is not directly autobiographical - but is ""very much about my memories of being that age"".
""I was never involved in University Challenge. I don't think anyone would have dreamed of going on University Challenge in my drama department. It would have been very uncool.
""But that feeling of being at a place and not quite sure what circle of friends to move in, and not being quite sure how to express yourself, and making all kinds of terrible mistakes - all of that is very personal and real.
""Certainly Bristol was a very happy time despite all the errors of judgement on the way.""
Like Brian and Emma, Nicholls graduated in 1988. However, he may never have gone to university if he had faced today's levels of student debt, he says - and nor would some of his characters.
""Emma wouldn't have gone, I wouldn't have gone, Brian wouldn't have gone. They'd have all been too anxious and frightened of £60,000 worth of debt. It would have been overwhelming.""
The author set up the Nicholls Arts Bursary to help support two undergraduates who want to take a theatre studies course at Bristol.
""I worry about it a lot,"" he adds. ""I worry that people are getting priced out of studying the arts and humanities in all kinds of ways, not just in theatre, and that is becoming something that only wealthy people can do.
""Naturally, people from lower incomes tend to be more risk averse, and that has had an effect on the whole of our arts scene, and I think that's a terrible shame.
""If arts and humanities subjects - subjects which are less obviously vocational - aren't open to everyone, then we all lose out.""
Nicholls is now preparing to publish his next novel, You Are Here, in April.
""I'm really proud of it. It's another love story,"" he explains. ""It's about two people who find themselves alone in middle age, on a long walk across the English countryside.
""It's about conversation, it's about two people getting to know each other and becoming friends and possibly more.""
While One Day ""has this it's sort of epic sprawl"" over 20 years, You Are Here takes place over just 10 days. ""I love them both, and they do share certain themes.""
You Are Here is his sixth novel, and they all share certain themes.
""The six books all together are this sort of epic about being in love from the age of 16 to the age of 58, which is my age now.
""If you staple them all together, they do tell a similar story, I guess. A comprehensive, cohesive story.
""I don't know what's going to come next. I have to find another aspect of being in love to write about.""
And with the streaming and stage spin-offs, the David Nicholls storytelling universe is continuing to grow.
Starter For Ten is at Bristol Old Vic until 30 March.

2024-03-06T09:30:08.000Z,Nigel Lythgoe: TV executive and talent show judge faces new sexual assault claim,BBC News,"British TV executive Nigel Lythgoe has been accused of sexual assault and battery in a new lawsuit.
An unnamed woman has accused Lythgoe, a former judge on US TV's So You Think You Can Dance, of ""groping her all over"" after pinning her against a wall.
It is the fourth lawsuit against the 74-year-old in recent months, including one brought by US singer Paula Abdul.
He has denied all previous allegations and his representatives gave no comment about the latest lawsuit.
Court documents filed in Los Angeles claim the woman was left feeling ""horribly violated"" and suffered ""severe emotional and psychological distress"" after the alleged assault in 2018.
Her lawyer Melissa Eubanks said: ""Mr Lythgoe allegedly forced himself upon our client during what was supposed to be a business meeting and then terminated their relationship when she did not acquiesce.""
The case comes after two former contestants on All American Girl, of which Lythgoe was a producer, sued him in January over alleged sexual assault.
Meanwhile, Abdul has claimed the TV mogul assaulted her while the pair worked together on American Idol and So You Think You Can Dance.
In his response to Abdul, filed this week and reported by US media, he called the singer a ""well-documented fabulist, with a long history of telling wild stories that are untethered from reality and are primarily designed to attract attention and make Abdul appear to be the victim of dreadful misfortune"".
He vigorously denied her claims, calling them ""false, despicable, intolerable and life-changing"" and describing them as ""the worst form of character assassination"".
Lythgoe was an executive producer of Pop Idol and American Idol and has also acted as an on-screen judge on Popstars in the UK as well as So You Think You Can Dance in the US.
He stepped down from So You Think You Can Dance with a ""heavy heart"" in January.

2024-02-27T16:20:04.000Z,BBC apologises over handling of Huw Edwards complaint,BBC News,"The BBC has apologised for the way it handled a complaint about the presenter Huw Edwards.
Allegations about his behaviour were made in May 2023 but did not reach senior managers until 6 July.
The corporation said the complaint was not ""escalated quickly enough"" and that it has now changed its processes.
An independent report by Deloitte into the BBC's complaints handling procedure said a complaint was made on the 18 May.
When the contact was first made by the family of a young person at a BBC location in Cardiff, the complainant was correctly signposted to the BBC's audience services as the first port of call for their complaint.
Once the complainant had contacted audience services on 19 May, the complaint was escalated to the corporate investigations team the same day.
But the case was then not logged on the BBC's case management system and there was no ""documented process"" for following up the allegations.
This meant that there ""was no opportunity for wider visibility of the case within the BBC.""
The BBC said it had already made improvements to its non-editorial complaints process but had further plans for ""greater consistency"" across teams... regardless of the route by which the complaints  are received and reviewed.""
It also said it would make better use of technology to ensure there is ""a complete picture of all cases"".
The report also stated some employees they spoke to said they would feel ""nervous about raising a complaint"" with the BBC, particularly if it was about a more senior colleague or a high profile figure.
It said: ""These employees said they have lower levels of confidence in how robustly the complaint will be handled if it is a grievance relating to another member of staff or talent, particularly where there is an actual or perceived power discrepancy between the complainant and the subject of the complaint.""
The Sun newspaper had published claims about a BBC News presenter paying a young person for sexual explicit photos.
Representatives from the BBC met detectives from the Met's Specialist Crime Command, but there was ""no investigation at this time"".
Detectives later decided there was no information to indicate that a criminal offence had been committed.
On 13 July, Huw Edwards' wife Vicky Flind, who named her husband as the man at the centre of the allegations, said he would respond when he was well enough.
BBC director general Tim Davie also sent an email to staff saying an internal investigation would continue now police were no longer involved.

2024-03-05T12:41:20.000Z,Celebrity Big Brother 2024: Princess of Wales' uncle Gary Goldsmith joins line-up,BBC News,"Gary Goldsmith, an uncle of Catherine, Princess of Wales, has entered the UK's Celebrity Big Brother house.
The 58-year-old businessman is the younger brother of the princess's mother, Carole.
Charity Women's Aid criticised ITV for hiring Goldsmith despite his previous conviction for punching his wife.
In an interview with the Sun, he said ""the last thing"" he wanted his appearance on the reality TV show to do was ""bring any stress to"" the family.
The princess is still recovering from abdominal surgery and has not made public appearances since Christmas Day.
Goldsmith introduced himself on the show as the ""uncle to the future queen of our country"", and said his niece was ""simply perfect"".
He added that he would also like to ""put the record straight"" on his ""bad boy reputation"".
In 2017, he was fined £5,000 and handed a community order after he admitted punching his wife in the face during an argument.
A spokesperson for Women's Aid told BBC News: ""The decision to include a man who has been charged, and pleaded guilty to, assaulting his wife, in the Celebrity Big Brother house demonstrates the lack of awareness that the production team has when it comes to survivors of domestic abuse.""
The charity said ITV should consider how Goldsmith's appearance ""will impact women who had survived domestic abuse"", adding that his inclusion was ""a sign that these crimes are not taken seriously"".
The Telegraph's arts and entertainment editor Anita Singh said ITV ""should be ashamed"" of themselves for ""having him as a 'fun' character"" on the show.
In response, a Big Brother spokesperson said: ""All housemates undertake training in language and behaviour before entering the Big Brother house. All behaviour in the house is strictly monitored at all times.""
They also pointed to a previous apology by Goldsmith, in which he said he was ""not perfect and I made a mistake"", which he had ""worked endlessly for seven years to put right"", and that his conviction was ""long since spent however my regret continues"".
In his pre-filmed introduction video, he said Big Brother was the one show he had previously said he would ""never do"".
Goldsmith auditioned for I'm A Celebrity 2023 but was reportedly rejected over fears he could embarrass the royal family.
In his interview with the Sun about the princess, Goldsmith said: ""She's beautiful on the outside, but more beautiful on the inside and really is a doting mum... so the way the monarchy is moving, it's family-centric.""
Goldsmith added: ""I've spoken to Carole just to send my love and we talked about Kate given what's going on.
""There's lots going on in the family at the moment. So she's spinning a lot of plates right now, it's quite stressful. So the last thing I'm going to do is bring any stress to them.""
The new series - which follows a six-year Celebrity Big Brother hiatus - has also reunited The X Factor's Sharon Osbourne and Louis Walsh.
In Monday's launch episode, Walsh and Osbourne were tasked with watching their fellow contestants and rating them from a secret lair.
The pair nominated three housemates to be ""in danger"" of facing a public vote, based on first impressions.
They chose Goldsmith, David Potts and Zeze Millz - and when asked for their reasoning, Louis replied: ""We didn't like them"".
Strictly's Nikita Kuzmin and Love Island's Ekin-Su Cülcüloğlu are also among this year's contestants.
The series started on Monday and is hosted by AJ Odudu and Will Best.
Here are the other contestants who are in the house with Goldsmith:
Fern Britton is best known for being one of the former hosts of ITV's daytime show, This Morning.
She presented the show for six years alongside Philip Schofield, before being replaced by Holly Willoughby in 2009.
In her introduction interview, she said she has no ""game plan"" and is just looking to have fun.
A judge on The X-Factor for more than a decade, Louis Walsh has joined the house and reunited with fellow judge Sharon Osbourne.
The Irish panellist worked as a mentor for JLS in 2008 and was also the manager of boyband Westlife.
He walked into the Big Brother house and said: ""Oh God, what have I done?""
Known for his role in the coming-of-age LGBTQ+ Netflix series Heartstopper, actor Bradley Riches has joined the line-up.
The 24-year-old is close friends with Jordan and Henry from last year's series of Big Brother - and said the advice he was given was to be himself.
He is autistic, and said he wants to ""inspire people"" and make them realise being different is ""very cool.""
Another young actor entering the Big Brother house is Colson Smith, who is best known for his role in Coronation Street as policeman Craig Tinker.
Colson has previously dabbled in reality TV and in May 2022 appeared as a contestant on sporting series The Games.
He is a long-time fan of the show and said going into the house feels ""mental"".
Love Island favourite and winner of the 2022 show, Ekin-Su Cülcüloğlu is joining the house following a split from former on-screen partner Davide Sanclimenti.
The TV personality has the most social media followers with 3.5m on Instagram. She also recently appeared on the US version of The Traitors.
She entered the house to chants from the live audience, and teased what may be to come as she said drama follows her ""everywhere"".
An original member of the Real Housewives of Cheshire, Lauren Simon is another reality star to enter the Big Brother house.
She said she ""doesn't answer to anybody"" - and that she might end up flirting with Big Brother.
Levi Roots is one of Dragons' Den biggest success stories.
The Jamaican businessman appeared on the show in 2007 and was looking for an investment in his Reggae Reggae Sauce brand.
He has since become a regular on cooking shows, and according to the Sunday Times Rich List, is worth an estimated £30m.
Saying he was very excited to be on the show, he called Big Brother a ""brother from another mother"".
Marisha is a US actress who is best known for roles in Aladdin and Dreamgirls on Broadway.
She has also appeared in the West End in Hairspray and Waitress.
In 2022, she received an Olivier Award nomination for best actress as Ado Annie in Oklahoma!
The actress and singer said she would be the ""jukebox"" of this year's show.
Strictly Come Dancing's favourite Nikita will be hanging up his dancing shoes for a while as he enters the Big Brother house.
The 26-year-old Ukrainian dancer has been on the show since 2021 and his dance partners have included Layton Williams and Tilly Ramsay.
He said he was just a ""kid from Ukraine"" looking to accomplish his dreams.
Social media celebrity Zeze Millz rose to fame with her YouTube show, The Zeze Millz Show.
She has interviewed the likes of Akon, N-Dubz and Fireboy DML.
Zeze has appeared on a number of British TV shows, including Good Morning Britain, E4's Celebrity Cooking School and The Victoria Derbyshire Show.
She called herself a ""polarising character"", but said people would be surprised to see her ""softer"" side.
TV personality David Potts is no stranger to reality TV having risen to fame on ITV2's reality series, Ibiza Weekender.
He also appeared on a celebrity episode of Dinner Date and the sixth series of the E4's Celebs Go Dating.
He described himself as a natural-born leader, ""like Mufasa in The Lion King"" - and said the audience would be in for a treat.
Another X Factor judge, Sharon Osbourne has joined the show, but not for the full duration of it.
According to The Sun, Osbourne's fee was too high to have her on the show for the whole time.
The wife of rock artist Ozzy Osbourne has been brought in as Big Brother's ""celebrity lodger"".

2024-03-06T13:08:02.000Z,The Gentlemen: Guy Ritchie says film themes were 'worth exploring' in Netflix series,BBC News,"Five years after The Gentlemen took audiences on a journey of mayhem and marijuana, director Guy Ritchie is returning for another crime caper.
But this time, the titular gentlemen - along with quite a few ladies - are returning for an eight-part TV series.
Ritchie said there were themes and storylines which were ""worth exploring"" further following the film.
Critics have broadly welcomed the series, although some say Ritchie relies too much on his usual style.
Empire said Ritchie ""simply remixes his hit singles"" for the series, with ""more gangsters, more heists, infinitely more dialogue"".
But the Radio Times said that, in spite of its shortcomings, the series ultimately is ""an absolute boat-load of fun"".
The 2019 film starred Matthew McConaughey, Colin Farrell and Hugh Grant - but none of them have returned to the franchise to appear in the TV series.
Instead, Theo James takes the lead opposite supporting characters played by Vinnie Jones, Ray Winstone, Joely Richardson and Max Beesley.
The series sees Eddie Halstead (played by James) inherit his wealthy father's country estate following his death, much to the fury of Eddie's pompous and drug-addicted elder brother Freddy.
Eddie initially considers selling the house to a rich but mysterious buyer - played by Breaking Bad's Giancarlo Esposito - but decides against it when he finds the estate is partly being used to grow cannabis for an extremely successful underground drug empire.
Speaking at the premiere on Tuesday, Ritchie said adapting the film into a TV series ""actually turned out to be easier than I anticipated"".
""You feel that this could run and run,"" he continued, ""the characters take on their own life, all you have to do is establish a character and create their own voice, and then couple that with an actor and we're off to the races.""
Viewers who haven't seen the film needn't worry, the TV series stands alone and does not require any prior knowledge.
Although it focuses on a similar criminal underworld and other familiar Ritchie themes, the show follows a whole new cast of characters and makes almost no references to the film.
""The fascinating conceit was what attracted me,"" James said at the premiere, ""the melding of the aristocracy and the underworld, and how those things collide in the bombastic way.
""Britain is so defined by class, and we love it and hate for various reasons, but defining it in the melee of this was really fascinating for me.""
One of the show's toughest and most assured characters is Susie Glass - played by Kaya Scodelario - who is running the cannabis farm under the estate's grounds.
""I very rarely get to portray women that are already at the top of the game when you meet them,"" the actress said, ""it's always a young woman finding her way in life.
""But what I loved about Susie is she's a boss, she's good at her job, she can run things, she knows exactly what she's doing.""
Esposito plays the wealthy investor who has his eye on the estate - Stanley Johnston. ""With a T,"" he repeatedly says - perhaps to differentiate the character from the real-life Boris Johnson's father.
The political references appear to be deliberate - another character is named Toni Blair.
Esposito said his character ""is someone who is graceful, patient, cordial, and the British are that way"".
""So this seems to be a perfect collision of this aristocratic culture and nature, but also not only criminality and non-humanity. And for me, that tells a bigger picture of our world.""
Ritchie's credits include Aladdin and The Covenant, but he is best known for films which focus on themes of violence, gangsters and drugs but with a uniquely British twist.
Films such as Snatch, RockNRolla and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels were hugely successful at the box office in the late nineties and early noughties.
Critics were broadly agreed that the series was entertaining, but several felt Ritchie leaned too heavily on his familiar style.
The Wall Street Journal's John Anderson said: ""No surprise, this crime dramedy showcases the Ritchie style, which is all about style: leaping jump cuts, slo-mo mayhem, layered imagery and dialogue, subtitles barging in on the mise-en-scène, and the visual implication that the world being put together is about to fly apart.
""The show does feel a bit bloated at times, self-indulgent in trademark Ritchie fashion. But the fact that the series comes across as a collection of short stories makes it far more palatable, and fun.""
There was agreement from the Evening Standard's Vicky Jessop, who awarded the series four stars.
""This all sounds wearily like going over old ground but surprisingly I found this hard to hate. It's just too fun: the fast cars, the increasingly unhinged baddies and how everything keeps going wrong in ever more spectacular ways.""
But Empire's Beth Webb said: ""The pace lags, Ritchie's usual speed flagging without the confines of a feature film, and the story is padded out by too much exposition
""Perhaps a smaller number of episodes could have saved The Gentlemen from verging on disengaging,"" she said. ""Instead, it scrapes by on playing Ritchie's greatest hits.""
The series was described as ""messy, convoluted, at times absurd and frequently overblown"", by James Hibbs of Radio Times. ""But,"" he countered, ""above all that, it is an absolute boat-load of fun.""
""For all those who enjoyed the film, even loved it, there were others who found it too violent, too glib, too high on its own supply.
""If that's you, then you'll want to stay away from this series. If that sounds like a bit of you, though, then strap in - it's going to be a truly wild ride.""
And Variety's Aramide Tinubu said the show's ""hijinks, plots and gory violence"" will keep viewers entertained, adding the series ""unfolds like a dazzling web of turmoil, keeping viewers sucked in over its eight episodes"".
The show's premiere took place in London's Covent Garden on Tuesday evening, with several cast members walking the red carpet and later taking part in a Q&A on stage.

2024-02-28T06:04:19.000Z,Adele postpones all Las Vegas show dates in March due to sickness,BBC News,"Adele has postponed all of next month's shows of her ongoing Las Vegas residency after announcing she is ill.
The British singer said on social media that doctors told her to rest but did not reveal details of her illness.
The announcement comes just over five months ahead of her 10-night run of stadium shows in Munich in August.
In a statement, she said: ""Sadly I have to take a beat and pause my Vegas residency.""
She explained that she had initially fallen ill at the end of her run of shows last year - all based at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace - in early November.
The residency was then due to take a break over the festive period.
But she explained that she had not got ""the chance to get back to full health before the shows resumed"" on 19 January. Since then she has performed 12 shows.
As part of her residency contract - which is scheduled to continue until June - she performs every Friday and Saturday.
New dates for the 10 postponed shows are yet to be announced, but ticket-holders will be sent the information ""asap"".
The residency was initially set to start in January 2022, but was cancelled just 24 hours before the first show was due to begin and was instead launched in March of that year.
Adele said at the time she was ""heartbroken"" to cancel them, but added the show ""ain't ready"" partly because members of her team had caught Covid.
In January, the London-born singer - whose albums 19, 21, 25 and 30 have all been massive worldwide successes - announced four concerts that will take place in a specially-built stadium in Munich, in August. She has since announced a further six.
The shows will be the first time she has performed in mainland Europe since 2016. On social media at the time the shows were announced, she wrote: ""I couldn't think of a more wonderful way to spend my summer and end this beautiful phase of my life and career with shows closer to home during such an exciting summer.""

2024-03-03T01:53:02.000Z,Raye's path to the Brits: 'It's not been the simplest story',BBC News,"With a record-breaking six wins and seven nominations at this year's Brit Awards, Raye has put a full stop on one of pop's greatest comeback stories.
The pop star, whose real name is Rachel Keen, has been barrelling about the record industry since she was a teenager. To a casual onlooker, it seemed like things were going well.
She wrote for big names like Beyoncé, Little Mix and Charli XCX. She produced records for Rihanna and John Legend. She collaborated with Stormzy and David Guetta. Songs like You Don't Know Me and Secrets sold enough to buy her a house.
But, as a solo artist, her music was constantly questioned and rejected.
In 2021, five years after she signed a four-album deal with Polydor Records, the label was still refusing to release her debut.
Not knowing what else to do, Raye posted a video message to social media, tearfully explaining her frustration.
Dozens of potential hits were ""sat in folders collecting dust"", she said, while others were being given away to bigger stars ""because I am still awaiting confirmation that I am good enough"".
""I've done everything [Polydor] asked me, I switched genres, I worked seven days a week,"" she said. ""They either listen to me now or we part ways and they can save themselves this headache.
""Because I'm about to make it a headache.""
The decision to post that video ""wasn't at all planned"", she later told the BBC. ""It was more of a desperate cry to be free.""
Polydor's public response was sympathetic. A spokeswoman said the company was ""saddened"" and had contacted Raye's manager (actually her dad, Paul) to ""offer our full support"".
Behind closed doors, they told Raye to stop giving interviews.
Eventually, however, they came to an agreement. Raye was freed from her contract, and allowed to keep the songs she'd written. Among them was Escapism, a dark and torrid song, written in the depths of her despair as she self-medicated with drugs and meaningless sex.
Polydor had never liked it. When Raye played it to other labels, they agreed.
""People were like, 'Yeah, this is cool [but] it's just something Raye needs to get out of her system',"" she told me last year.
Raye disagreed and released it independently. The song immediately went viral on TikTok and, tens of millions of streams later, it went to number one.
The singer followed it up with her long-awaited album, My 21st Century Blues. Gritty, triumphant and catchy, it showcased her ability to genre-hop between jazz, soul, hip-hop, dance and gospel without losing her sense of identity.
By the end of the year, it had sold more than 60,000 copies and been nominated for a Mercury Prize. Then came her record-breaking haul at the Brits.
""It's just brilliant when you get to prove people wrong,"" she has said of her success.
""It's not been the simplest story - but it just shows that you should back yourself, no matter what people tell you.""
So how did she get here? Let's go back to January 2017, when Raye was a newcomer who'd placed third on the BBC's Sound Of 2017.
Then aged 19, she showed us around the childhood bedroom in South London where she'd started making music.
""Keep out!"" demanded a handwritten sign on the door. ""I'm doing private stuff! If it's urgent, then knock!""
Directly underneath she'd blu-tacked a photo of her little sister, Abby - exposing the tender heart beneath the tough exterior.
Inside, it was a typical teenage room - a poster of Gustav Klimt's The Kiss adorned the wall above her bed, while a cluttered desk was crammed full of make-up brushes, school photos and a half-spent candle.
""This is my favourite place to be,"" she said. ""Things are starting to happen, but this is still my base. It's nice having my family close.""
Music and religion were woven into her home life. Her Yorkshire-born father led worship at the local Pentecostal church while her mother, a Swiss-Ghanaian mental health worker, sang in the choir.
After the Sunday services ended, Raye's father would show her how to play worship songs on his piano.
""I'd on sit his lap and push his hands out of the way, like, 'I can do it!'""
Aged seven, she repurposed a melody from a kids' TV show and passed it off as her own, a sort-of plagiaristic first venture into writing.
Four years later, she penned a ""proper"" song for her Year 6 leaving concert, which the whole school performed at Southwark Cathedral.
At 14, she passed an audition for the Brit School, where she spent two years learning the basics of writing and producing. But, ultimately, it wasn't the right fit.
""It's all cool, underground, indie artists,"" she said in 2016. ""I did a song called HotBox, and I was scared to play it to people because I was like, 'Oh, my friends might think this is moist [embarrassing].'""
A smoky, blurry R&B track about her first encounter with drugs, HotBox was inspired by progressive R&B artists like Jhene Aiko and Frank Ocean.
And despite Raye's apprehensions, it was pivotal to her career: The song was discovered by Olly Alexander from Years & Years, who played it to his record label, Polydor.
A courtship began.
""I had my first album pretty much ready to go before I'd even joined the label,"" Raye subsequently told Vogue. ""By the time I was 17, they had spent three years wooing me... over fancy dinners.
""But it didn't take long for me to see that the dreams they lured me with were hot air.""
After the deal was signed, fans who'd fallen in love with Hotbox and Raye's independently-released EP, Welcome To Winter, noticed her music had taken a significant tilt towards pop.
At first, she defended the change: ""With Welcome to the Winter, I realised nobody really cared other than the cool kids in London,"" she explained in 2016.
""So I had to find a way to do what I want, in a way that people would hear it.""
Before long, she was scoring massive hits on the dance chart. Her first big payout came for co-writing Blonde's All Cried Out. Then, in 2017, she made the top 10 as the guest vocalist and co-writer on Jax Jones's bold and ballsy club anthem You Don't Know Me.
The success came with a caveat: Polydor wanted more and more dance hits. Only when Raye had established her name, they insisted, could she take creative control.
But that never happened, and the songs she was pressured to write meant almost nothing to her.
Speaking to Louis Theroux last year, she singled out the global smash hit Bed (written with David Guetta in 2021), as one of her most soulless recordings.
""It's really, really very boring,"" she admitted. ""It's not my favourite song, but my bank account loved that song.""
'So what?', you might think. If you can make a living from churning out identikit dance anthems, where's the harm?
The truth is that Raye's spirit was being demolished, one generic kick drum at a time.
To get through it, she turned to drink, then drugs.
""I was able to get along with my career because I was in some form of sedation,"" she told Theroux.
Then it got worse.
Raye has always been open about her experiences of sexual assault in the music industry. Her song Ice Cream Man was based on an incident where a music producer forced his hand between her legs when she was 17 years old.
Shockingly, it was not an isolated incident. ""This happens to girls in studios all the time,"" she said. ""All the time.""
By the time Ice Cream Man was released on her debut album, the updated lyrics listed a catalogue of abuse.
""I was seven, was 21, was 17, and was 11,"" she sang. ""If I was ruthless, they'd be in the penitentiary.""
Those memories resurfaced at the same time as a bad break-up and, with her career in tailspin, things got dark.
""When you keep things in like that, they eat away at you from the inside,"" she said.
""And for me, sadly, substance abuse was entangled with numbing the trauma that I had experienced. I got pretty deep in and it got really dangerous at one point.""
Escapism describes the moment she hit rock bottom, snorting cocaine in taxis with strangers and hoping one-night-stands would make the bad thoughts go away.
It was only when she reconnected with the church that she pulled herself out of the abyss.
""There's a world in which if I didn't find faith again, I might not even be here,"" the singer said.
""And when I got sober, I realised what I'd been doing to myself... to try and be somebody they wanted me to be.""
That, more than anything else, prompted the dramatic protest against Polydor that kick-started her journey to independence.
Doors that had been closed suddenly opened up. She played Glastonbury's Pyramid Stage, won an Ivor Novello award for Escapism, and wrapped up her tour with a massive, televised gig at the Royal Albert Hall.
Her record-shattering and tear-stained night at the Brits marked the overdue arrival of a pop star whose voice is as unique as it is compelling.
""Finally, I'm here and finally, I'm in control of my career,"" she told me. ""Things are so positive and I really am so grateful.

2024-03-12T18:47:55.000Z,Showtown: New £13m museum aims to recapture Blackpool's showbiz heyday,BBC News,"Strictly Come Dancing costumes, a vintage Sooty puppet and Stan Laurel's hat are among the items on show in a new museum dedicated to Blackpool's glory days of entertainment.
Showtown puts a spotlight on the town's rich history as the seaside home of showbiz, with other exhibits including George Formby's ukulele, Tommy Cooper's fez and Peter Kay's purple suit.
The £13m venue, Blackpool's first ever permanent museum, opens on Friday and hopes to contribute to the town's present-day regeneration.
The ""museum of fun and entertainment"" is located behind the resort's seafront on the site of one of its many former pleasure houses, The Palace nightclub.
The new attraction marks the town's place as the spiritual home of ballroom dancing and Strictly's second home, showing outfits worn on the BBC show by former winner Stacey Dooley and professional dancers Joanne Clifton and Katya Jones.
From further back in time, the six galleries include the door of a Blackpool police cell from which Harry Houdini escaped in 1905, a Mr Punch puppet dating from 1850, and vintage designs from the town's famous illuminations.
Blackpool was also famed for its end-of-the-pier variety shows. On show are suits worn by comedy duo Morecambe and Wise, the uniform worn by Danny La Rue for the Queen's Silver Jubilee in 1977, and fellow comedian Bobby Ball's red braces.
The V&A museum in London has lent 28 items including Tommy Cooper's trademark fez and other props, and Sooty and Sweep puppets from the classic children's show.
The characters became children's TV favourites after Harry Corbett bought Sooty from a joke shop on Blackpool's North Pier in 1948.
Showtown chief executive Liz Moss said the museum was a ""fascinating, bright, brash, bold collage of all of those stories, those entertainment greats - but done in a really innovative and colourful way"".
She told BBC News she hoped it would put a spotlight on the town's place in the entertainment industry and ""bring new visitors"" to the town, adding: ""We hope it will help as part of this rejuvenation of Blackpool.""
The town was one of the top destinations for British holidaymakers in the 19th and 20th Centuries. It received 20 million visitors in 2022, but is also now considered one of the most deprived places in England.
Council leader Lynn Williams said: ""Blackpool can get a bit of an unfair turn in the press coverage, and I don't think we realise our contribution to social history. I think it's really important for our residents to be able to celebrate that.
""We know our challenges in Blackpool and we're working really hard to resolve those around health and housing issues.
""There's massive regeneration going on - and for our residents and our visitors this is another fantastic attraction to come to, which is what Blackpool does best.
""It also links with the other cultural stuff that's going on around the town.""
A major new cultural strategy has been drawn up with the aim of bringing together the town's talent and boosting its profile as a creative hub.
It involves big venues along with organisations like Leftcoast, which works with communities on projects that are both practical and creative - such as a People's Pantry, where residents can meet and swap food; and a combined laundry and library that also hosts arts workshops.
Leftcoast is also developing an ice cream business led by an artist, which will cater for tourists during the summer and provide employment.
The idea behind the town's strategy is to ""make sure that the offer here is as attractive as it might be if you go to Manchester or Liverpool or London or Birmingham or Bristol"", Leftcoast artistic director Tina Redford said.
""It's really to elevate what you're seeing here, because it does exist, and it is brilliant. It's just that sometimes it gets lost in the noise of everything else.
""So the ambition really is to make it conspicuous and visible for people to want to get involved in it.""

2024-02-26T11:52:07.000Z,Amy Schumer: Actress reveals she has Cushing's Syndrome,BBC News,"Actress and director Amy Schumer has revealed she has Cushing's Syndrome, caused by having steroid injections in high doses.
She revealed the condition after being swarmed by comments about her face, with fans saying it looked ""puffier"" during recent TV interviews.
In her initial response, Schumer attributed the change in her appearance to endometriosis.
The subsequent Cushing's diagnosis left her feeling ""reborn"", she said.
""There are a few types of Cushing. Some that can be fatal, require brain surgery or removal of adrenal glands,"" the actress told the News Not Noise newsletter.
""I have the kind of Cushing that will just work itself out and I'm healthy [which] was the greatest news imaginable,"" she added.
Cushing's syndrome occurs when a person has elevated levels of cortisol, the body's primary stress hormone, inside the body for a long time. It mostly affects people on steroids.
Jessica Yellin, who founded News Not Noise, said she had reached out to Schumer after reading about the online discourse about her appearance.
Schumer replied that she had sought medical advice after reading the comments.
""I was also in MRI machines four hours at a time, having my veins shut down from the amount of blood drawn and thinking I may not be around to see my son grow up,"" she told Yellin.
""Aside from fears about my health, I also had to be on camera having the internet chime in.
""But thank God for that. Because that's how I realised something was wrong.""
Schumer had appeared on US TV earlier this month to talk about season two of the sitcom Life And Beth, which she writes, directs and stars in.
During the promotional tour, the actress, who has also starred in the sketch show Inside Amy Schumer, the 2015 film Trainwreck and 2018's I Feel Pretty, visited The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon and The View.
Afterwards she faced a barrage of jokes mocking her face, as well as medical speculation and supportive comments.
""I've enjoyed feedback and deliberation about my appearance,"" she said.
Adopting a semi-serious tone, the actress added on Instagram that she had endured such speculation ""for almost 20 years [...] as all women do"".
The NHS website says the syndrome can be serious if not treated, and is uncommon.
It is often a result of people taking steroid medicine, especially tablets, for a long time, which contain a synthetic version of cortisol.
Very rarely, the syndrome can be caused by the body producing too much cortisol, caused by a tumour in the pituitary gland in the brain or in one of the adrenal glands above the kidneys.
Cortisol is known as your ""fight or flight"" hormone. When it sends out alarm signals to the brain in response to stress, it can influence almost every system in the body, from the immune system to digestion and sleep.
The syndrome is usually benign [non-cancerous] and most common in young women.
Symptoms tend to get slowly worse if not treated, and the website said one of the main signs is weight gain and more body fat. Symptoms can include:
Other symptoms include skin that bruises easily, large purple stretch marks, weakness in your upper arms and thighs, reduced libido and fertility problems, depression and mood swings.
The Pituitary Foundation, which provides support about Cushing's Syndrome in the UK, told the BBC they were sorry to hear about Schumer's diagnosis, saying it was ""encouraging to see her raising awareness of her condition"".
They wished Schumer ""all the best in her recovery"" and encouraged anyone who thinks they may have it to contact their GP.
""Cushing's syndrome is rare, affecting only a few  people in every million, per year,"" a spokeswoman said.
""Some people live with symptoms for many years, so raising awareness is key to ensuring that people can get a diagnosis.""
The spokeswoman added that other symptoms could include ""excessive hair growth, irregular periods and feeling more irritable and anxious"".
Praising News Not Noise as her ""favourite credible news source"", Schumer said she wanted to ""advocate for women's health"".
""I want so much for women to love themselves and be relentless when fighting for their own health in a system that usually doesn't believe them,"" she said.
""I want women to value feeling strong, healthy and comfortable in their own skin.""
She has previously spoken about body positivity, and said it was important to ""advocate for self love and acceptance of the skin you're in"".
""The only other thing I'd like to add is that this is a good example of the fact that we never know what is going on with someone,"" she said.
""Everyone is struggling with something. Maybe we can all be a little kinder to each other and ourselves.""
Schumer added that comments about her son's name in 2020 had prompted a similar period of self-reflection.
The actress had initially planned to call him Gene Attell, with his middle name a nod to her friend, the comic Dave Attell.
People online were quick to point out that the name ""sounds like genital"".
As a result, she changed it to Gene David.
""I realised I had named my son something that didn't sound so good,"" she said. ""The internet is undefeated, as they say"".
The actress, who co-hosted the 2022 Oscars, also announced she had Lyme disease in 2020.

2024-03-12T15:44:29.000Z,Tate Britain unveils new counterpoint to offensive Rex Whistler mural,BBC News,"The Tate Britain has unveiled a new work that seeks to contextualise a 1927 mural that has been sealed off from the public since 2020 for its use of racist imagery.
Viva Voce, a film by Keith Piper, has been installed next to Rex Whistler's painting, which includes depictions of black slaves on a leash and caricatures of Chinese figures.
The Tate said the film, which imagines an academic challenging Whistler about his mural, explores ""the social and political context of 1920s Britain"".
The 20-minute video piece also considers the time and place in which Whistler was working, discussing his social circle and their consumption of black jazz music.
It also includes archival footage of black soldiers during the First World War; and the notorious ""Races in Residence"" pavilion at the 1924 British Empire Exhibition.
The latter saw almost 300 people from colonised countries living on the exhibition grounds and providing demonstrations of native crafts - as though they were curiosities on display.
Piper is a multi-media artist and academic, who was part of the British Black Arts movement in the early 1980s.
He said it was important to interrogate the Whistler mural to understand how these images came to be created.
""As a teacher, I speak to young artists all the time, questioning them about their practice,"" he said.
""I want to give a sense of how and why the mural exists,"" he added.
Speaking to The Guardian, he defended Tate Britain's decision to keep the mural rather than remove it.
""I know there is an argument among young people now that these images re-traumatise, but I think we either look or forget,"" he said.
""We are very good at forgetting nowadays and things that are out of sight go out of mind. To keep a clear sense of history we need to see these things.
Rex Whistler's mural, titled The Expedition in Pursuit of Rare Meat, was previously housed in a restaurant at Tate Britain.
In 2020, the Tate's ethics committee said they ""were unequivocal in their view that the imagery of the work is offensive"".
The room was subsequently shuttered during the pandemic and has not reopened since.
In 2022, it was announced the gallery would be commissioning an installation to ""be exhibited alongside and in dialogue with the mural, reframing the way the space is experienced"".
They said the work ""should not be altered or removed"", but noted the ""uncomfortable juxtaposition of the mural and an eating space"".
Tate Britain's director, Alex Farquhar son, said in 2022 the mural presented a ""unique challenge"".
He added: ""The mural is part of our institutional and cultural history and we must take responsibility for it, but this new approach will also enable us to reflect the values and commitments we hold today and to bring new voices and ideas to the fore.""
Zarina Muhammad and Gabrielle de la Puente, who make up art criticism duo The White Pube, previously told the BBC: ""The mural does not need to be kept to be remembered; the mural certainly does not need to be continuously restored with millions of pounds worth of funding in order for us to discuss the problems within its imagery.
""We can still talk about the horrible things it stands for even after it is destroyed, and destruction isn't an end point. So it should go. Tate should stop defending it.""

2024-03-13T05:26:44.000Z,Mel B on moving back in with her mum after 'abusive marriage left her powerless',BBC News,"Melanie Brown made millions from the Spice Girls, but a few years ago, after leaving an abusive marriage, she was left with almost nothing.
She left California, returned home to Leeds and moved into her mum's bungalow.
The singer, 48, says while she ""is all about girl power"", she was in a ""powerless"" situation after the abuse.
Brown has now managed to buy her own home again, something she thought would ""never be on the cards"".
The decision to move back home came while the Spice Girls were wowing the UK on their sold out stadium tour in 2019.
Although the shows were profitable, Brown's proceeds were being spent on legal fees and payments to her ex-husband Stephen Belafonte, who she has alleged was abusive.
Brown told the BBC: ""I wasn't just emotionally and physically abused, there was all the financial abuse too. I didn't realise that I didn't have as much money as I thought I had. So I literally had to eat humble pie, live with my mum.""
She added: ""My mum was the kind of person that would say, 'Oh you've left him now, you're fine'. But that couldn't be further from the truth.
""Obviously any situation is better than being with your abuser, but when you've left that kind of abusive situation, it's like starting all over again. You have to learn to trust people. You have to learn to trust yourself.""
Belafonte, a film producer, has repeatedly denied the claims against him made by the singer.
They reached a private settlement out of court in 2017, and their divorce was finalised a year later.
As part of the settlement, Brown had to pay Belafonte a $350,000 (£274,000) lump sum plus $5,000 (£3,900) a month in child support for their daughter Madison.
The star, who has been opening up about her life after the abuse depicted in her book, Brutally Honest, says being back in Leeds has ""definitely"" helped her find her feet.
""My mum's one of seven so I'm surrounded by friends, family, aunties, uncles, nephews, nieces - the whole nine yards.
""Leeds is beautiful, it's so green and so down to earth and people, I just find them warmer.""
Brown announced on Instagram in February that after working ""bloody hard"" for more than five years she had finally been able to buy her own home.
""I've been looking at houses on and off for the last couple of years, knowing I didn't have the money to afford them,"" she told the BBC. ""But I just put my head down, worked and lived frugally and hence I've been able to buy my own house.""
Part of ""living frugally"" meant Mel had to start shopping on a budget, something she is not giving up any time soon.
""I still love shopping in Aldi and Lidl, I don't think I'm ever going to stop doing that to be honest. I'm still a Leeds girl!""
In 2018, Mel was made a patron of Women's Aid and campaigning for survivors of domestic abuse is now a huge part of her life.
""I bring awareness and I talk about abuse and I talk about what I've been through,"" she said.
""I'm the voice of all the other survivors out there that don't have a voice, that can't be heard, that can't get their point across - especially when it comes to things like trying to change the justice system and trying to enforce more laws that are more supportive to people that are coming out of an abusive situation.""
During her last marriage, Brown said she only felt safe when she was away from home, at work.
She believes employers should help victims in the workplace and be ""fully aware of the tell-tale signs of abuse"".
Meanwhile, this year marks the 30th anniversary of the Spice Girls' first audition - and demand is still high for them to return to the stage as a five-piece.
Brown said the band ""would be back together tomorrow"" if it was up to her and ""it's just a case of logistically getting it going"".
The women are all still friends and chat on a WhatsApp group - which Brown admits she leaves ""quite a lot and then joins again"".
""I'm the funniest because I'm the northerner,"" she laughs. ""Well Mel C is very funny too. We're all funny in all different ways.""
The singer has been engaged to her partner Rory McPhee since 2022, and is planning to get married at St Paul's Cathedral in London.
On rumours that Victoria Beckham will design the dress Mel said: ""Yeah, she'd love to"" - but confessed she was considering several options.
Either way, all of her bandmates will be there for the big day. As their song goes ""friendship never ends"".

2024-03-11T03:29:42.000Z,Oscars 2024: Oppenheimer sweeps awards as Cillian Murphy wins best actor,BBC News,"Cillian Murphy has become the first Irish-born winner of the best actor award, as Oppenheimer swept the Oscars.
The film dominated proceedings, winning best picture, best director for Christopher Nolan, and best supporting actor for Robert Downey Jr.
Murphy was named best leading actor for his acclaimed portrayal of theoretical physicist J Robert Oppenheimer.
The actor said he was ""overwhelmed"" to have won, adding: ""I'm a very proud Irishman standing here tonight.""
He thanked Nolan and producer Emma Thomas for ""the wildest, most exhilarating, most creatively satisfying journey you've taken me on"".
Murphy also paid tribute to ""every single crew and cast member, you carried me through"".
He concluded: ""We made a film about the man who created the atomic bomb, and for better or for worse, we are all living in Oppenheimer's world, so I'd like to dedicate this to the peacemakers everywhere.""
The ceremony saw Oppenheimer win seven prizes overall, while Poor Things took four - including best actress for Emma Stone - and The Zone of Interest scored two.
Downey Jr won best supporting actor for his portrayal of US government official Lewis Strauss in Oppenheimer.
Accepting the award, the actor joked: ""I'd like to thank my terrible childhood, and the Academy, in that order.
""I needed this job more than it needed me,"" he continued. ""I stand here before you a better man because of it.""
The star also paid tribute to his wife Susan Downey, who he said had found him as a ""a snarling rescue pet"", adding that she ""loved me back to life, that's why I'm here"".
Downey Jr, best known for his run as Marvel's Iron Man, has enjoyed a hugely successful Hollywood comeback after serious drug addiction issues more than two decades ago, which saw him serve a prison sentence after missing court-ordered drug tests.
He concluded his speech by telling the audience: ""What we do is meaningful and what we decide to make is important.""
Host Jimmy Kimmel joked the cast and crew were ""getting Oppen-hammered at the bar"", such was the film's success.
As he accepted his first ever best director Oscar, Nolan said: ""Thank you to those who have been there for me, believed in me for my whole career.""
Addressing the Academy, he said: ""Movies are just a little bit over 100 years old, we don't know where this incredible journey is going from here, but to know that you think I'm a meaningful part of it means the world to me.""
A somewhat disorientated-looking Al Pacino appeared to forget to introduce the 10 nominees for best picture, before going straight to announcing Oppenheimer as the winner of the night's top prize.
Accepting the prize, producer Emma Thomas said: ""I think any of us who make movies dream of this moment. But it seemed so unlikely that it would ever actually happen.""
Oppenheimer also won best editing, original score and cinematography. However, it lost several other technical categories, denying it a record-breaking number of wins.
Instead, the unusual steampunk drama Poor Things won best production design, costume design, make-up and hairstyling, as well as best actress for Emma Stone.
The Yorgos Lanthimos film follows an infant whose brain has been implanted into the body of an adult woman, who then goes on an adventure of discovery across the world.
""This is really overwhelming,"" Stone said in her speech. ""I am so deeply honoured to share this with every cast member, crew member, every person who poured their love, care and brilliance into the making of this film.""
Best actress was the only major category that awards watchers had struggled to call - it had been seen as a dead heat between Stone and Lily Gladstone for Killers of the Flower Moon.
But Martin Scorsese's drama about a string of Osage murders in the 1920s went home empty handed despite being nominated in 10 categories at the ceremony.
Barbie, the highest-grossing film of 2023, won only one of the eight prizes it was nominated for - best original song for What Was I Made For? by Billie Eilish.
""Thank you so much to the Academy, I was not expecting this, I feel so incredibly lucky and honoured,"" Eilish said as she accepted the award with her brother and collaborator Finneas O'Connell.
Da'Vine Joy Randolph won best supporting actress for her portrayal of a school chef who is trying to cope with the death of her son in The Holdovers.
In her acceptance speech, Randolph told the audience: ""For so long I have always wanted to be different. And I now I realise I just needed to be myself, and I thank you for seeing me.""
The Zone of Interest won best sound and became the first British film ever to win best international feature. The critically acclaimed Holocaust drama follows a German family who live next to the Auschwitz concentration camp.
In his acceptance speech, director Jonathan Glazer criticised Israel and the ongoing war in Gaza.
Best documentary feature went to 20 Days In Mariupol. Its director Mstyslav Chernov told the audience that he was ""honoured"" to become the first Ukrainian Oscar winner.
""I'm probably the first director on this stage to say I wish I would never have made this film,"" he said, adding: ""I wish to be able to exchange this [for] Russia never attacking Ukraine, never occupying our cities.""
Elsewhere, Anatomy of a Fall won best original screenplay. The film's director and co-writer Justine Triet joked the Oscar would ""help me through my mid-life crisis"".
The film follows a woman accused of killing her husband, with the only nearby witness her visually impaired son.
American Fiction was named best adapted screenplay. Its writer Cord Jefferson said: ""I've been talking a lot about how many people passed on this movie when discussing it, and I'm worried that sounds vindictive, but it's more a plea to recognise there are many people out there who want the opportunity I was given.""
The writer said he understood Hollywood ""is a risk-averse industry"", but said studios should commission more smaller-scale movies. ""Instead of making one $200m movie, try making 20 $10m movies,"" he said.
Japanese fantasy film The Boy and the Heron was named best animated feature film, holding off competition from Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse.
And director Wes Anderson won his first Academy Award in the live action short category for The Wonderful Story Of Henry Sugar, based on the story by Roald Dahl.
For the fourth time, the ceremony was hosted by Jimmy Kimmel. The US chat show host opened with a monologue which reflected on the past 12 months in the film industry.
Recalling the strikes that brought Hollywood to a standstill, Kimmel paid tribute to the efforts made to get a fair deal for actors and writers.
He joked that actors could now stop worrying about ""being replaced by AI, and could go back to worrying about being replaced by younger, more attractive people"".
Turning his attention to Barbie stars Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, he said: ""If neither of you wins an Oscar tonight, I would like to say you won something much better, the genetic lottery.""
Kimmel also suggested the nominated movies ""were too long this year"", adding: ""When I went to see Killers of the Flower Moon, I had my mail forwarded to the theatre.
""Killers of the Flower Moon is so long,"" he continued, ""in the time it took you to watch it, you could drive to Oklahoma and solve the murders yourself.""
Towards the end of the ceremony, Kimmel read out an online post from former US President Donald Trump, who had complained about Kimmel's performance.
Responding to Trump live on air, Kimmel said: ""Thank you President Trump, thank you for watching, I'm surprised you're still up, isn't it past your jail time?""

2024-03-03T16:47:54.000Z,Jamie Laing: Jordan North's replacement says he's 'not just posh idiot',BBC News,"Jamie Laing, the Made in Chelsea star taking over BBC Radio 1's drivetime show, has insisted he is ""not just a posh idiot"" after facing a backlash over his appointment.
Laing, 35, who is replacing long-standing presenter Jordan North, will host his first show on Monday.
When Laing was unveiled as the new host, some social media users complained he was too posh.
But Laing told The Sunday Times it was wrong to assume he ""just swanned in"".
""I've been trying to get this job for eight years, constantly grinding, constantly asking to do little slots,"" he said.
""No-one is given a job here because their mum or dad helped them into it. You have to earn your colours.""
Radio 1 announced last month that Laing would be taking over the Going Home show between 15:30-17:45 Monday to Thursdays alongside Vick Hope.
He had previously presented on the station during Mollie King's maternity leave, describing it as ""an absolute dream"".
But some fans of the station expressed their dissatisfaction at the decision, with one writing on Twitter/X: ""Radio 1 has turned into the posh boys club.""
North, who spent time at a community radio station while still at university, worked his way up in the industry.
Laing, whose great-grandfather founded the McVitie's biscuit empire, was privately educated. He is best known for appearing on the reality television series Made in Chelsea, which follows the lives of affluent young people in West London.
Addressing the criticism directly, Laing indicated he saw his new role as vindication.
""I suppose what people see now is that I'm maybe not just a posh idiot,"" he said.
""After years of doing podcasting, the audience went, 'Oh, hang on, we trust this person'. That's what it's all about, especially in audio, because you don't really see the individual, so you really need to trust them.""
Laing also laughed at some of the abuse he has received online.
""Someone commented, 'I think Jamie Laing's a really great guy', and someone wrote underneath saying, 'What planet are you on? Is there oxygen?' That's actually quite funny,"" he said.
Laing previously co-hosted the Radio 1 podcast 6 Degrees from Jamie and Spencer and also presents the NewlyWeds podcast alongside his wife Sophie Habboo, another Made in Chelsea star.
North is to replace Roman Kemp as host of Capital Radio's breakfast show.
He had presented the drivetime show with Hope since 2021, having previously presented weekend shows like Greatest Hits on Sundays.
He also co-hosts the popular Help I Sexted My Boss podcast with William Hanson.

Some of the world's biggest music stars will appear there when the MTV awards ceremony takes place on 10 November.
The MTV show has not been held in Manchester before, and has not been staged in the UK for seven years.

2024-02-21T12:00:50.000Z,An Enemy of the People: Matt Smith says audiences left in tears by new production,BBC News,"Audience members have been left in tears, walked out halfway through and had ""full-blown"" arguments with each other, Matt Smith has told the BBC of his new play.
The Doctor Who actor is starring in a new production of Henrik Ibsen's 1882 drama, An Enemy of the People.
During the play, audiences are invited to participate in a townhall discussion and ask ""whatever they want"".
The FT called it a ""brilliant idea that drives home the resonance of the play"".
In a four-star review, Sarah Hemming said the audience interaction responds to the play's ""central issue by giving people a platform for engagement"".
However, she added that the section ""could be longer and riskier"".
The play centres around a medical officer who discovers that the water in his town's spa is contaminated. He decides to speak up about the truth, but his community attempt to silence him as it is not in their interest for this to be exposed.
Speaking to the BBC after the opening night of the show, Smith said he was drawn to this classic play because ""the idea of the audience being able to participate has always appealed to me"".
""I really want people to come and engage, put their hands up and say whatever they want to,"" added The Crown star.
The audience's questions, which are entirely unscripted, have already ruffled a few feathers, and Smith said he has witnessed audience arguments, walk-outs and tears.
Alice Saville of The Independent noted that the tone of the questioning ""is more Gardener's Question Time than explosive LBC phone-in"".
In her three-star review, she said there was ""no room for real debate or danger"" and that the ""the targets of the play's actual critique feels frustratingly vague"".
The Telegraph's Dominic Cavendish also awarded the play three stars and said it needed ""a digital-era upgrade, and a shot more vigour, to set the world on fire"".
However, he praised Smith for his performance and noted he was a ""natural fit for the role of Dr Stockmann"" and ""gleams with authority"" throughout.
The 41-year-old actor ""turns from rebel to self-appointed guru and shows how the truth-teller can himself become corrupted"", according to the Guardian's Arifa Akbar.
""His tirade on everything from the postmaster scandal to food banks swings between talking truth to power and loony conspiracy,"" she wrote in her four-star review.
However, she added that ""not all of it works"", referencing various scenes which are brushed over and characters that lack development.
Speaking on the relevance of the play today, Smith told the BBC ""there is a sort of universality to it that stands the test of time"" and raises questions about truth. ""How do you quantify it? Who's telling the truth? If you're undermining it, does it then dilute it?""
Director Thomas Ostermeier, whose play marks his West End debut, added that he wanted to ""promote the idea of how important it is to speak up and even though there are different forces that will try to silence you, you need courage to speak up"".
There was a five-star review from Louise Griffin of the Radio Times, who praised Smith for his performance and said his ""shining moment"" was a ""monologue that single-handedly will prompt standing ovation"".
""An Enemy of the People is full of contradictions that somehow work,"" she continued. ""It's incredibly serious and incredibly funny, it's messy and meticulous, with characters that are simultaneously moral and morally corrupt.""
She also praised other characters including Priyanga Burford who, as Aslaksen, leads the audience questions.
""She easily navigates a sequence that could (and probably will at some point) go badly wrong with humour, tenacity, and incredibly quick wits,"" Griffin wrote.
Paul Hilton, who plays Smith's onstage brother who is mayor of the town, was also praised for his performance.
""Hilton is excellent as the establishment brother and their sibling tensions are well caught: they regress into angry little boys when they fight,"" write Akbar in The Guardian.
Clive Davis of The Times said Hilton ""outshone"" Smith and brings ""a snarl to Stockmann's establishment-minded brother"".
He only awarded the show two stars overall, however, writing: ""Ostermeier's sophomoric attempt to drag the Norwegian playwright into the 21st century is so clumsy it might almost be part of some sinister conservative plot to kill off left-wing theatre once and for all.
""The big query rattling around in my mind,"" he concluded, ""was who would pay £175 or more for a stalls seat just to call for the end of capitalism as we know it.""
Smith last performed in the West End in 2019 in the Old Vic's production of climate change drama Lungs alongside Claire Foy.
The pair also starred alongside each other in the first two series of Netflix's The Crown.

2024-02-23T09:52:01.000Z,Ben Shephard hosts his last Good Morning Britain before move to This Morning,BBC News,"Ben Shephard has hosted his final edition of Good Morning Britain, before he leaves for his new role co-hosting This Morning with Cat Deeley.
He hosted his final programme alongside Kate Garraway, with whom he has presented ITV shows for decades.
Shephard said he had some ""amazing memories"" working on the programme.
He added it was ""a real privilege"" to have covered major news events on the show such as the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II and the King's Coronation.
""But mostly,"" he told his colleagues, ""the things that stand out are the people, working with you guys, the guests that we have come in.""
Fellow GMB presenters Susanna Reid, Charlotte Hawkins, Richard Arnold, Andi Peters, Sean Fletcher and others joined Shephard on the sofa to say goodbye.
His final programme also featured tributes from Lorraine Kelly, Martin Lewis, Chris Kamara as well as messages from viewers.
Folk music group Fisherman's Friends also performed a song in tribute to Shephard.
Referring to the later start he will have hosting This Morning, the host joked: ""I'm going to get a lie-in... the alarm going off has never been something I enjoyed.
""But what I have known,"" he continued, ""is as soon as I get in I'm going to be surrounded by you brilliant, incredible, gorgeous, talented, challenging, chaotic, annoying, fabulous people who make me better at what I do.""
""It's not lost on me that I wouldn't be able to do it if you lot weren't amazing and hadn't been such brilliant friends and colleagues.""
He added: ""It's not just us, we just get to do the glorious bit, when it goes right but the team behind the cameras and everybody, thank you to them and thank you to the viewers as well for trusting me to wake you up in the morning.
Shephard and Deeley will join This Morning next month, replacing Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby, who left the show last year.
The pair will host the show from Monday to Thursday, with Alison Hammond and Dermot O'Leary continuing to present on Fridays.
Reflecting on his move, Shephard said hosting This Morning was an ""exciting opportunity"", but added: ""It's literally the other side of the wall so I'm really, really not going far.""
He also thanked viewers for their ""amazing messages"" of support after the news was announced last week.
Former footballer Kamara, who Shephard worked with on ITV game show Ninja Warrior UK, said his Thursdays and Fridays watching GMB would ""never be the same again"" and called him ""one of the nicest fellas"".
""Without your help and patience I couldn't have gotten through the podcast that we did together last year,"" he said.
The programme also featured messages from Shephard's former GMTV colleagues John Stapleton and Fiona Phillips along with former football manager Harry Redknapp.
""Ben, just wishing you all the very best for your new job,"" Phillips, who is married to This Morning editor Martin Frizell said. ""So excited for you.""
Stapleton said: ""It's 24 years since you walked into that GMTV newsroom and I remember several people saying to me, 'watch that lad, he'll go far'.""
Shephard, 49, occasionally stepped in as a replacement for Schofield on This Morning before joining GMB at its launch in 2014.
Since then, he has been one of the regular hosts alongside Garraway, Susanna Reid and Hawkins. He began hosting more editions of the show in the aftermath of Piers Morgan's exit in 2021.

2024-03-08T01:14:59.000Z,The return of Gossip's Beth Ditto: 'I'm really shy',BBC News,"As indie-rock band Gossip prepare to headline the 6 Music Festival, frontwoman Beth Ditto explains their 12-year absence, reveals her shy side, and discusses the ""fear"" facing America's LGBTQ community.
Any raver worth their glowsticks will, at some point, have lost their breath dancing to Gossip.
With indie anthems like Standing In The Way Of Control and Heavy Cross, the trio perfected a mish-mash of punk, dance and soul that kept dancefloors burning throughout the 2000s.
Frontwoman Beth Ditto became a cultural icon, too. Outspoken and anti-conformist, she charmed the media while challenging their attitudes to femininity and sexuality.
Even the morbidly chauvinist NME succumbed, calling Ditto ""the coolest person in rock"".
In hindsight, she says the attention was unexpected.
""I didn't have a goal to sell a tonne of records,"" she recalls. ""We never wanted to be famous. The only goal was to not work a fast food job.""
Fame knocked anyway, extracting its usual levy: Fractured relationships, frayed nerves and disillusionment.
""Eventually, you just need a break, but in the music industry you're not allowed to have that,"" Ditto explains. ""So you end up making things you don't like. You become a product.""
Gossip dissolved in 2016, with Ditto declaring she ""needed to be independent and stand on my own"".
The singer threw herself into a solo album, launched a plus-size clothing line, and starred in the TV show Monarch - but her personal life was in turmoil.
She divorced her wife of five years, Kristin Ogata, her father passed away, and she lost touch with Gossip co-founder Nathan Howdeshell, after he became a born-again Christian.
So when she joined super-producer Rick Rubin at his studio in Kauai, Hawaii, to sketch out a second solo album, things didn't get off to a flying start.
""My ex-wife is from Hawaii, we got married there,"" she says. ""So trying to make a record there after the divorce was really difficult.
""I was looking out at the ocean, literally in paradise, but I was so down in the dumps.""
Creatively gridlocked and ""beating herself up"", she called Howdeshell and invited him out. They'd repaired their relationship on a short reunion tour in 2019. Ditto now compares their estrangement to a squabble between siblings.
""We're childhood friends and we're family,"" she says. ""It sounds really gross, but it's true.
""I think we just needed to let each other grow and change and make mistakes and do things that hurt each other.""
Encouraged by Rubin, who's worked with Run-DMC, Johnny Cash, Tom Petty and Red Hot Chilli Peppers, Howdeshell began to flesh out Ditto's songs.
Slowly but surely, it began to sound more and more like a Gossip record than her solo material.
""I was watching Nathan playing guitar in this little makeshift studio and I was like, 'I can't in good conscience take that credit away from him',"" Ditto says.
""So I looked at him in that moment and I said, 'Well, this is a Gossip record now'. And he said, 'Oh, I'll try harder, then!'
""I thought that was so funny. He hadn't wanted to step on my toes. After that, it felt more collaborative.""
The pandemic put the sessions on hold but, after restrictions eased, the original trio (Ditto, Howdeshell and drummer Hannah Blilie) reconvened to complete their first album in 12 years.
Titled Real Power, it's a restless and daring 45 minutes of electric pop: The sound of a band ripping through their favourite riffs and rediscovering the joy of playing together.
The title track was inspired by the Black Lives Matters protests of 2020, celebrating anyone who stood up to abuse of power at a time when gathering in the streets ""could literally make you ill"".
Elsewhere, the band are more vulnerable and reflective.
""I like peace and quiet… but the silence is killing me,"" sings Ditto, in one of several songs referencing the end of her marriage.
""You can definitely hear the sadness on the record,"" she says. ""I like sad songs. Every singer loves a ballad. We want the key change, we want Total Eclipse of the Heart.""
But the sadness wasn't exclusively hers.
""Nathan lost someone and it was very upsetting. A lot of his music became very country-influenced, so that was the mood, and those are the words that came up.""
Since the album was finished, however, Ditto has found love again. She's now engaged to musician Ted Kwo, who also happens to be Gossip's touring bassist.
She admits it was hard to introduce him to songs about her ex-wife.
""It's wild when you make a record about something that's so sad, and now you're with somebody else and the music is like a time capsule of all of your downs,"" she says.
Ditto couldn't even bear to have him rehearse the songs in their house. He practiced for their tour ""upstairs with his headphones on"".
""And it's not just him. I don't want to know what anyone thinks. I'm too shy. It makes me really self-conscious.""
That last comment might come as a surprise.
In public, at least, Ditto has never seemed afraid of expressing herself. An outspoken advocate for body positivity and LGBTQ rights, her attitude was inspired by the feminist queer punk scene she fell in love with as a teenager.
But while her quotes jump off the page, her conversation is all sweetness and Southern charm. She giddily confesses to loving Christmas so much that her ""gaudy"" decorations don't come down 'til February, and shyly declines to turn on her Zoom camera.
""I'm so dumb,"" she says. ""I don't want to see my face, because then I'm fixing my hair instead of paying attention.""
Ditto grew up poor in the Bible-toting town of Judsonia, Arkansas. The middle of seven children, she learned self-reliance at an early age.
""If we wanted something, it wasn't like. 'You've got to work for it and earn it', it was, 'Why don't you learn how to make it?'""
She recalls coveting a particular 1960s-inspired trouser suit as a teenager. With no money to save, let alone spend, she took a pair of trousers, drew their outline onto a spare piece of fabric and sewed the outfit herself.
""If you don't have money, and you don't have clout, it makes you incredibly resourceful,"" she says. ""You have to think your way out of things, and figure out how to navigate in a world where all you have is your talents and your skills.""
Independence informs everything she does, from her music to her activism. At a time when pop music was determinedly apolitical, she wrote Standing In The Way Of Control in response to the Federal Marriage Amendment, which would have outlawed same-sex marriage in the US.
It was dedicated to a friend who'd been shaken by the wave of homophobia unleashed by the proposal - not just from politicians, but from family and friends.
""When your entire existence is being debated in public, it stirs things up,"" says Ditto.
""So that song wasn't just about marriage or equality. It was about your right to exist and  be left alone. It was for my friend.""
She sees a parallel with the current spate of Republican-backed laws that limit classroom instruction on LGBTQ issues, restrict access to gender-affirming care and ban drag performances in front of children.
Supporters argue that young people should be shielded from life-altering health care decisions; but more than a dozen major medical organisations have opposed the laws, which the American Civil Liberties Union have characterised as being ""Anti-LGBTQ"".
Ditto sees the fall-out first hand. Her fiancé is a transgender man, and she describes the atmosphere in America as ""chilling"".
""I feel like I need to make it clear that I don't want to speak for the trans experience, because I'll never know what it feels like, but we live in fear of the repercussions every day.
""The lack of compassion is really hard to watch. It really does feel like a dystopian novel. I try not to get upset about it, but it's hard.""
They take pleasure in the small things - celebrating Christmas for three months straight, or ""crying my eyes out"" at the Abba Voyage show.
""We're having such a good time, it's really fun,"" she laughs.
""Teddy's 48 years old but he looks so young that a lot of people think he's my son!""

2024-02-23T16:17:58.000Z,Avatar: The Last Airbender receives mixed reviews from critics,BBC News,"Netflix's newest live-action offering, Avatar: The Last Airbender, is dividing critical opinion.
The eight-part series is a remake of the popular animated fantasy series of the same name by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko.
They both signed up with Netflix to make the live action version, but did not see out the project.
The 2024 Albert Kim remake has been described by Variety as a ""beautifully crafted disappointment"".
Critic Aramide Tinubu said the series ""is far from the mess"" of another remake - the 2010 M. Night Shyamalan film The Last Airbender, but added: ""It will leave fans wishing the streamer had left DiMartino and Konietzko's masterpiece alone.""
She added: ""While the show's visuals and its Asian and Indigenous stars add authenticity to the series, the performances of the majority of the cast, no matter how earnest, don't hold up to the weight of the narrative.
""Many of the series' portrayals lack the extensive emotion needed to carry a show centring on the horrors of genocide, war and totalitarianism.""
The show's legal team will be keen to point out that this has nothing to do with Avatar itself, the highest-grossing film ever made, but is still a big hit with fantasy lovers.
Without giving too much away, the premise of the series is there are four divided kingdoms, defined by fire, earth, water and air - with the ""benders"" who live in them harnessing these elements into some sort of magical power.
Its main characters include 12-year-old Aang, played by Gordon Cormier, who teams up with 14-year-old Katara (Kiawentiio) and her older brother Sokka (Ian Ousley), to save their kingdoms.
The Guardian's Jack Seale was more complimentary, awarding the series four stars.
""The landscapes sparkle, there is a giant six-legged flying bison that carries everyone spectacularly from place to place through the clouds and the young cast are up to the task,"" he wrote.
""The Airbender franchise has confidently revived itself; this won't be the last we see of it.""
However, Empire's Kambole Campbell gave the series just two stars, adding that it ""sadly mostly sheds the original's cartoonish charm and dynamic presentation in favour of more self-serious fantasy"".
He added that it is ""a rather drab and thinly sketched spin on well-worn fantastical tales of oppression and rebellion"" and despite each episode running for an hour, ""the show somehow feels too long and too short at the same time"".
There was a middling review from the Telegraph's Anita Singh, who awarded it three out of a possible five stars.
""It's solid entertainment,"" she said. ""Fast-moving, action-packed, with decent fight scenes and some appealing performances, all done on a generous Netflix budget.
""Don't expect subtlety - this is aimed at children so the characters and plot are broadly drawn.""
Singh said she watched it with her children, the agegroup the series is broadly aimed at, who also gave their own review - ""It's good,"" they said, ""but not as good as SpongeBob SquarePants.""
Whilst most reviews have drawn some positives from the show, the same can't be said for that of Vulture's Jackson McHenry.
""From the very start, the live-action series has a lot of flaws,"" he wrote. ""The acting is wooden, the writing is even more wooden, the costumes are garish, the score drones on annoyingly, and it all looks like it was filmed through a light glaze of mud.
""But worst of all, the self-serious, hour-long premiere of the new series is simply dull. It's hard not to zone out somewhere along the way, and harder still to muster the enthusiasm to continue on for seven more instalments,"" he added.
""What should have felt like an exciting adventure romp instead feels like being handed a homework assignment, which is a rough fate for something based on a Nickelodeon kids' cartoon.""
But Paul Tassi of Forbes was more positive, writing: ""You can tell this is made by a cast and crew that have a lot of love for the source material.
""It is not as good as the animated series,"" he continued. ""Of course it isn't. This is painting the Mona Lisa with coloured pencil, where it may be great in its own right, but it's just an entirely different medium that could never live up to the original masterpiece.""
However, he concluded: Despite a mountain of scepticism, including from myself who counts the original as one of my favourite shows ever, I have to say Netflix's Avatar: The Last Airbender is much better than I thought it would be. By the end, I genuinely enjoyed it.""

2024-02-22T15:48:01.000Z,ITV follows Post Office drama with contaminated blood scandal series,BBC News,"ITV is to follow its hit drama about the Post Office scandal with a new series about what it calls the ""biggest health scandal"" in British history.
Writer Peter Moffat will tell the story behind the contaminated blood scandal.
It is thought that about 30,000 people were infected with HIV and hepatitis C through contaminated blood products in the 1970s and 1980s.
Bafta winner Moffat said victims had been ""let down"" by the state and his show would let ""their voices be heard"".
The announcement comes after Mr Bates Vs the Post Office drew in more than 10 million viewers and dominated the headlines last month.
Following an outcry, the government has announced plans for new legislation to quash the convictions of hundreds of people who were wrongly convicted of false accounting, theft and fraud.
Moffat was working on the contaminated blood scandal series before Mr Bates Vs the Post Office was broadcast, but it has now been ""fast-tracked"" following that show's ""monumental success"", Deadline reported.
More than 3,000 people are thought to have died in what has been described by MPs as the worst treatment disaster in NHS history.
The untitled series will focus on the ""courage and dignity of victims and their families who have campaigned for truth, justice and accountability against impossible odds"", according to ITV.
Moffat, who is behind dramas including Silk, Criminal Justice, North Square and Your Honour, said: ""It's been a great privilege to meet those infected and affected and to learn about what they have been through.
""I'm ashamed to say that when I started researching this story I knew next to nothing about it. I'm even more ashamed that this ignorance is shared by nearly everyone I mention it to.
""The victims of this scandal have been let down again and again by the state - I hope in some small way this drama can help their voices be heard.""
ITV's head of drama Polly Hill said: ""Peter's scripts are brilliant and do justice to this important story, while bringing it to screen with real clarity and compassion.""
Des Collins, senior partner of Collins Solicitors, which represents 1,500 victims and their families, welcomed the news.
The series will ""expose much of what our clients have endured, not only emotionally and health-wise, but also in terms of shoddy treatment by government, in their decades-long battle for justice during which too many lives have unnecessarily been lost"", he said.
A public inquiry into the contaminated blood scandal heard its final evidence last year. Its chairman Sir Brian Langstaff published his final recommendations for a full compensation scheme for those directly affected by the scandal and their relatives.
The government has said it accepts the ""moral case"" for compensation, and interim payouts of £100,000 each have already been made to about 4,000 victims and some bereaved partners.
However, in December it said it was still not in a position to make a final decision on compensation until it has seen the inquiry's findings in full. The publication of the final report has been delayed until May.

Ballroom dance company Burn The Floor said it had ""lost one of its founding members"".
""He danced with us for 20 years, including Broadway, the West End and all our crazy adventures around the world,"" they said in a statement on social media. ""He leaves a void in our hearts.""
Windsor was born in Suffolk, and first began dancing at the age of three when his parents enrolled him in classes in Ipswich, according to his website.
He moved to London aged 15 to pursue a dancing career and went on to represent England in numerous championships, both on the domestic and international levels.
In addition to Strictly, Windsor appeared on Dancing with the Stars Australia and So You Think You Can Dance in Holland.

He was forced to pull out of Strictly Come Dancing in 2014 after suffering ongoing back problems.

""In my eyes he was always a star,"" Du Beke added. ""We're going to miss you, Robin.""
Former judge Arlene Phillips told BBC Morning Live: ""Robin was the most powerful Latin dancer you could wish for. Every step, every move was imbued with the drama of Latin.

""He was sweet and kind and… there was something so lovely about him - passionate, driven. And I am devastated he's so young… he's just a baby, as far as I'm concerned. He'll be very, very, very, very much missed.""
Former Strictly pro Kristina Rihanoff posted that Windsor ""wasn't just my dance partner, he was a friend"".
""When I got partnered with him on Strictly I was blown away by his kindness, light-hearted personality and amazing loyalty.

2024-03-04T14:08:48.000Z,Sinead O'Connor's estate asks Donald Trump not to use her music,BBC News,"The estate of Sinéad O'Connor has asked Donald Trump to stop using her music at his political rallies.
Last month, Mr Trump played O'Connor's best-known song Nothing Compares 2 U at a campaign event in Maryland.
The singer's estate told BBC News it was ""no exaggeration to say that Sinéad would have been disgusted, hurt, and insulted"" by his use of her music.
Mr Trump is running to be the Republican presidential candidate ahead of the US election in November.
A joint statement from O'Connor's estate and her longtime label Chrysalis Records said: ""Throughout her life, it is well known that Sinéad O'Connor lived by a fierce moral code defined by honesty, kindness, fairness, and decency towards her fellow human beings.
""It was with outrage therefore that we learned that Donald Trump has been using her iconic performance of Nothing Compares 2 U at his political rallies.
""It is no exaggeration to say that Sinéad would have been disgusted, hurt, and insulted to have her work misrepresented in this way by someone who she herself referred to as a 'biblical devil'.""
The statement concluded: ""As the guardians of her legacy, we demand that Donald Trump, and his associates desist from using her music immediately.""
The Guardian reported songs including Abba's Dancing Queen, Johnny Cash's Ring of Fire and Elvis Presley's Suspicious Minds were used in addition to Nothing Compares 2 U before Mr Trump took to the stage on 24 February.
Written by Prince, O'Connor's version of Nothing Compares 2 U spent four weeks at number one in the UK in 1990.
O'Connor died last July aged 56. A coroner later said she died of natural causes.
Mr Trump served as the 45th US president after winning the 2016 election, but he lost to President Biden in 2020.

2024-03-13T09:45:20.000Z,Neil Young to put his music back on Spotify after boycott over Joe Rogan,BBC News,"Neil Young has said his music will return to Spotify, ending a two-year boycott over Joe Rogan's podcast.
In 2022, Young told the streaming giant to remove hits like Harvest Moon and Heart of Gold, complaining that Rogan was spreading vaccine misinformation.
However, the singer said his return did not reflect a reversal of his stance.
Instead, the decision came after Rogan signed a $250m deal to make his podcast available on multiple platforms, rather than remaining a Spotify exclusive.
""Other music services [including] Apple, Amazon, Qobuz, Tidal... have started serving the same disinformation podcast I had opposed at Spotify,"" Young wrote on his website.
""Because I cannot leave all those services like I did Spotify, because my music would have no streaming outlet to music lovers at all, I have returned.""
Young said in January 2022 that Spotify represented 60% of his streaming revenue globally, which amounted to ""a huge loss for [his] record company to absorb"", but that he removed his music because he ""could not continue to support Spotify's life-threatening misinformation to the music loving public"".
Other artists, including Joni Mitchell and India Arie, also removed their songs in solidarity.
At the time of writing, Young's back catalogue has yet to be reinstated on Spotify. Mitchell's Spotify page only contains live recordings, while Arie's music returned last year.
The Joe Rogan Experience is consistently the most-played podcast on Spotify. The long-form shows, which often run for several hours, feature wide-ranging interviews with a variety of guests, including comedians, athletes, scientists and conspiracy theorists.
It has frequently been a source of controversy for Spotify. In 2022, the host was forced to apologise for using racist language in early episodes of the podcast, which launched in 2009.
He signed a new deal with Spotify last month, under which the programme will become available on rival services including YouTube and Apple Music.
He previously expressed his disappointment with Young's decision to withdraw from Spotify, and said he was not intentionally giving a platform to Covid-19 vaccine misinformation.
""I'm not trying to promote misinformation,"" he said at the time. ""I'm not trying to be controversial. I've never tried to do anything with this podcast other than to just talk to people.
""I do not know if they're right. I don't know because I'm not a doctor; I'm not a scientist. I'm just a person who sits down and talks to people and has conversations with them.""
However, Neil Young's squabble with Spotify is not entirely over.
In his statement, the star criticised the platform for not offering hi-fi quality, lossless audio to its users.
""[I have] sincere hopes that Spotify sound quality will improve and people will be able to hear and feel all the music as we made it,"" he wrote.
""Hopefully Spotify will return to Hi Res[olution] as the answer and serve all the music to everyone. Spotify, you can do it!""
Most of Spotify's biggest rivals - including Apple, Tidal, Amazon Music and Qobuz - offer lossless audio, which is closer to CD quality than the compressed files served by Spotify.

2024-02-23T09:20:17.000Z,Stuart Organ: Longest-serving Grange Hill actor dies aged 72,BBC News,"Grange Hill star Stuart Organ has died aged of 72, his representatives have confirmed.
The British actor was the longest-serving cast member on the children's TV drama, playing Mr Robson.
Organ, who started his acting career in Leeds in 1975, also appeared in the soap Brookside and Doctor Who.
His other credits include Casualty, The Bill and Holby City and films such as Those Glory Glory Days and Fork In The Road.
The actor ""died peacefully at home after a short illness"", it was announced on Friday.
Organ will be best remembered for his 15-year stint on the BBC's Grange Hill, where his character Peter Robson arrived as the head of PE in 1988, going on to take the headmaster role 10 years later.
The show, which was about life in a London comprehensive school, ran from 1978 to 2008 and made headlines for tackling big issues such as racism, drug abuse, teenage pregnancy, mental illness and HIV and Aids.
The actor decided to leave the series in 2003 after it was announced that production was moving to Liverpool.
Grange Hill made household names of characters such as Zammo McGuire, played by Lee MacDonald, and Tucker Jenkins, played by Todd Carty.
In 2022, creator Sir Phil Redmond spoke about the show returning as a film.
Organ's other memorable roles include playing Kevin Cross in the Merseyside soap Brookside and Bazin in the Doctor Who plotline Dragonfire in 1987.
He began his acting career at Leeds Playhouse in 1975 in a performance of Tom Stoppard's Rosencrantz And Guildenstern Are Dead, a spin-off of William Shakespeare's Hamlet.
His other theatre roles include An Englishman Abroad, where he played Guy Burgess in a 2003 production in York and Major Powell in the play Corpse, which he performed in Hornchurch in 2007.
Whilst a younger audience may have not seen him act, they may have heard his voice elsewhere - he has appeared as the voiceover on cartoons and video games, such as Star Wars: The Old Republic.
He is also a familiar voice to London Underground passengers,  announcing stations, lines, late arrivals and telling users to mind the gap.

2024-02-28T06:09:19.000Z,Kate Bush says she's 'privileged' to become Record Store Day ambassador,BBC News,"Pop star Kate Bush has been announced as an ambassador for this year's Record Store Day, on 20 April.
Bush said it was a ""great privilege"" to support the initiative, which champions independent record shops and vinyl collectors across the UK.
""Isn't it great to see how the resurgence in vinyl has taken the music industry by surprise?"" she said.
""It had decided to leave vinyl far behind, but it would seem that not everyone agrees! I love that!""
She added: ""I know there are many, many artists who are just as excited to see the audience turning the tide.""
This year's Record Store Day will see hundreds of limited edition, one-off albums and singles released, with titles by David Bowie, The 1975, Olivia Rodrigo, Notorious BIG, The Beatles, De La Soul and Gorillaz amongst the most sought-after items.
As an ambassador, Bush will help to promote the event - which often generates long queues of record collectors, as well as in-store performances and other special events.
The star will also lend her support by releasing a special 10-inch vinyl of Eat The Music, from her 1993 album Red Shoes.
Initially intended as the album's lead single, it was scrapped in favour of the more radio-centric Rubberband Girl. The Record Store Day release features the original artwork, printed directly onto the disc, instead of on the record sleeve itself.
""The title, Eat the Music, is meant to be a playful nod to 'If music be the food of love, play on,'  from Shakespeare's Twelfth Night,"" Bush explained in a statement.
While she has not released new music since 2011, Bush has seen a resurgence in popularity thanks to the use of Running Up That Hill in hit sci-fi show Stranger Things.
After exploding on TikTok, it went to number one in the UK charts, and gave Bush her first top 10 hit in the US - just 38 years after it was first released.
Announcing her appointment as Record Store Day ambassador, Bush also reflected on the appeal of vinyl records, and the listening experience they fostered.
""In the same way that some people like to read a book on Kindle but also want to have a book as a physical object, a lot of people like vinyl and streaming,"" she wrote. ""Both have different appeals.
""The added bonus of vinyl is that it encourages people to listen to albums. An art form that I've always thought can be treasured in a unique way.
""An album on vinyl is a beautiful thing, given a strong identity by its large-scale artwork. There's a much more personal connection with the artist and their work.""
She concluded with a message for fans of her music, and Record Store Day itself.
""This year, I hope you have a fantastic time at this very important event, and that you get to celebrate music that's been specially released for you.
""Very best wishes, Kate"".
This year's edition of Record Store Day arrives as sales of vinyl hit a 33-year high in the UK.
Sales rose by 11.7% to 5.9 million units in 2023, increasing for the 16th year in a row, according to data from the British Phonographic Industry (BPI).
Taylor Swift's 1989 (Taylor's Version) was the best-selling LP, followed by the Rolling Stones' Hackney Diamonds.
Record Store Day is supported by BBC 6 Music, and you can read a full list of this year's exclusives on the campaign's official website.

2024-02-28T14:31:07.000Z,Rebecca Ferguson refuses to work with co-star who screamed at her,BBC News,"Actress Rebecca Ferguson has said she once refused to work with a co-star who screamed at her on set and left her in tears.
The Swedish star told the Reign with Josh Smith podcast that she once worked with an ""absolute idiot of a co-star"".
She said she learned to stand up for herself after the star criticised her and she eventually asked for them to turn their back while she was acting.
Ferguson did not reveal the co-star's identity or gender.
The Dune: Part Two actress said the other actor was ""being so insecure and angry because this person couldn't get the scenes out"" and ""would literally look at me in front of the whole crew and say 'You call yourself an actor? This is what I have to work with?'""
She added that she felt ""so scared"" about the confrontation which saw her being ""screamed at"". Ultimately, Ferguson said she called them out on their behaviour.
""Because this person was number one on a call sheet, there was no safety net for me, so no one had my back,"" she explained.
She said she told the individual to ""get off my set"", and said to them: ""I'm gonna work towards a tennis ball. I never want to see you again.""
When producers told her the star had to be allowed on set as they were ""number one"", Ferguson instead requested to act to the back of her co-star's head.
""I thought it shouldn't have to be that way, and I remember going to the director afterward and saying, 'What is happening?'
""The director said, 'You're right, I am not taking care of everyone else. I'm trying to fluff this person because it's so unstable.'
""And it was great from that moment but it took so long for me to get to that,"" she said.
She added that she has only become confident enough to stand up to this type of behaviour ""within my last 10 or 12 years, and I've acted since I was 16"".
Although Ferguson did not name the co-star, she said it was not Tom Cruise who she starred alongside with in Mission Impossible, or Hugh Jackman, who played the main role in The Greatest Showman.
She added: ""Doesn't matter who it is, I'm gonna try and not give this away.""
Dwayne Johnson, who appeared opposite Ferguson in 2014's Hercules, replied to a video clip of the interview on X, writing: ""Hate seeing this but love seeing her stand up to [it].
""Rebecca was my guardian angel sent from heaven on our set. I love that woman. I'd like to find out who did this.""

At Sunday's Independent Spirit Awards, Offerman won best supporting performance in a new scripted series, for playing Bill in the TV drama.
Bill and his partner, Frank, are among the survivors of a fungal brain infection in the hit HBO show.
Offerman thanked HBO for ""having the guts"" to tell such stories.
He added they were ""stories with guts, that when homophobic hate comes my way and says, 'Why did you have to make it a gay story?', we say, 'Because you ask questions like that - it's not a gay story, it's a love story.'""
Offerman's comments were met with loud applause from the audience at the event, in Santa Monica, California.
He was nominated alongside Murray Bartlett, who played Frank; while Bella Ramsey was up for best lead performance, for playing Ellie.
Their co-star Keivonn Montreal Woodard won the award for best breakthrough performance, for playing Sam.
Netflix's Beef also won two awards in the TV categories - best new scripted series and best lead performance, for Ali Wong.
In the film section, Korean-American romance Past Lives won best feature and best director, for Celine Song.
Literary-satire American Fiction won best lead performance, for Jeffrey Wright, and best screenplay, for Cord Jefferson.
And 1970-set boarding-school comedy-drama The Holdovers picked up best supporting performance, for Da'Vine Joy Randolph, and best breakthrough performance, for Dominic Sessa.
The Independent Spirit Awards ceremony, held in a marquee on Santa Monica seafront, is the latest event in the Hollywood awards season, and focuses on programmes and films made outside the major studio system.
A pro-Palestinian protester made sure his message was heard by playing a recorded chant over a loudspeaker throughout the event.

2024-02-29T18:07:24.000Z,"Viral TikTok singer Cat Janice dies of cancer, aged 31",BBC News,"US singer Cat Janice, who found fame on TikTok, has died of cancer aged 31.
Janice, who released the song Dance You Outta My Head from hospice care, had been diagnosed with sarcoma, a rare cancer of the bones or soft tissue, in March 2022.
She revealed during treatment she had transferred the rights to her music to her seven-year-old son, Loren.
Her family said they were ""eternally thankful for the outpouring of love"" they had received.
""Cat saw her music go places she never expected and rests in the peace of knowing that she will continue to provide for her son through music,"" they said.
""This would not have been possible without all of you.""
Since she released Dance Outta My Head, in the first week of this year, it has topped the TikTok Billboard Top 50 and reached the top 10 of Billboard's dance and electronic chart.
Her music video has also had 57 million views online.
Janice, whose real name is Catherine Ipsan, started writing and producing music as a teenager, which she released in her 20s.
She kept her social-media followers up to date with her treatment after being diagnosed.
Four months later, after surgery, chemotherapy and radiation, Janice was told she was cancer free - but the disease returned to her lungs in June 2023.
In a message to her followers, she posted: ""I've got the rough news that cancer has won.
""I've fought hard but sarcomas are too tough.
""I reset all my music to go to my son. And I wanted to put out one more song for my birthday.
""I want my last song to bring joy and fun.

She said she was leaving her songs ""behind for my son"" and encouraged her followers to download her music to help secure his financial future.
Janice, who was from Washington DC, spent her final weeks at home baking and making music when she felt strong enough, according to the New York Times.
Her husband, Kyle Higginbotham, said he hoped her music career would be remembered as more than a ""sob story.""
""It's not just, some girl made a song because she's dying of cancer,"" he said.
""Cat's a real-deal artist and poured every minute of her life into it, right up until the end.""

2024-02-23T10:10:06.000Z,Israel's Eurovision entry under scrutiny over alleged reference to Hamas,BBC News,"Israel says it will pull out of the Eurovision Song Contest if organisers try to censor its entry.
It comes after the lyrics to Eden Golan's October Rain were leaked to the media earlier this week.
According to the Israel Hayom newspaper, the song references the victims of the 7 October Hamas attacks, with lyrics including: ""They were all good children, each one of them.""
Eurovision organiser The EBU said it was currently assessing the song.
The contest's rules forbid political messages, in a gesture to neutrality.
In previous years, the EBU has forced national representatives to change their lyrics. In 2009, Georgia withdrew from the contest after their proposed entry - We Don't Wanna Put In - was rejected for its obvious references to the Russian president.
In a statement regarding Israel's 2024 entry, organisers said: ""The EBU is currently in the process of scrutinizing the lyrics, a process which is confidential between the EBU and the broadcaster until a final decision has been taken.
""If a song is deemed unacceptable for any reason, broadcasters are then given the opportunity to submit a new song or new lyrics.""
However, Israel's public broadcaster, KAN, said it would reject any request to alter the lyrics.
""It should be noted that as far as the Israeli Broadcasting Corporation is concerned there is no intention to replace the song.""
""This means that if it is not approved by the European Broadcasting Union, Israel will not be able to participate in the competition, which will take place in Sweden next May.""
KAN also confirmed that the leaked lyrics for October Rain were accurate, and published them in full on its website on Wednesday.
Described as a ""moving and powerful ballad"" the song is based around the refrain ""I'm still wet from this October rain"".
In the verse, Golan sings: ""Who told you boys don't cry/ Hours and hours/ And flowers/ Life is not a game for the cowards.""
The reference to flowers is significant, according to Israel Hayom, as it is military slang for war fatalities.
The song then ends in Hebrew: ""There's no air left to breathe/ There's no place/ No me, from day to day.""
KAN said that Israel's culture minister Miki Zohar had contacted the President of the EBU to request that the panel approve the song.
""In his letter, the minister wrote that Israel is in one of its most complex periods, and that this fact cannot be ignored when choosing a song to represent it,"" the broadcaster reported.
Writing on X, Mr Zohar said it would be ""scandalous"" to disqualify the song.
""The song of Israel, which will be performed by Eden Golan, is a moving song, which expresses the feelings of the people and the country these days, and is not political,"" he added.
""We all hope that Eurovision will remain a musical and cultural event and not a political arena - where the participating countries can bring their uniqueness and nationalism to the stage through music.
""I call on the European Broadcasting Union to continue to act professionally and neutrally, and not to let politics affect art.""
Separately, musicians from other countries that participate in Eurovision have called for Israel to be suspended over the war in Gaza.
In December, Iceland's Association of Composers and Lyricists published a statement saying Israel's military action made its participation incompatible with an event ""characterised by joy and optimism"".
Similar protests have been raised in Finland, Norway, Denmark and Sweden, with several pointing out that Russia has been disqualified since its invasion of Ukraine two years ago.
So far, Eurovision organisers have resisted calls for Israel's exclusion, saying the situations in Ukraine and Gaza are different.
""Comparisons between wars and conflicts are complex and difficult and, as a non-political media organization, not ours to make,"" Noel Curran, the director general of the European Broadcasting Union said in a statement.
""We understand the concerns and deeply held views around the current conflict in the Middle East,"" he said. However, he added, Eurovision was ""not a contest between governments"".
""The EBU is aligned with other international organizations, including sports unions and federations and other international bodies, that have similarly maintained their inclusive stance towards Israeli participants in major competitions at this time,"" the statement concluded.

""Cillian would do a magnificent job as James Bond on His Majesty's Secret Service,"" Brosnan told the BBC.
Reports suggest Murphy might be in the running although there have always been rumours about who will play Bond next.
Brosnan was speaking at the annual Oscar Wilde awards, which celebrate Irish creative talent in Los Angeles.
Murphy, who was also in attendance at the event at JJ Abrams's Bad Robot Productions in Santa Monica, is favourite to win best actor at the 96th Oscar awards on Sunday for his titular role in Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer.
He said he had not heard the Bond rumours himself and also revealed that he had not really thought about possibly winning the Academy Award: ""I just want to go in and have a good time.""
He's up against Paul Giamatti (The Holdovers), Colman Domingo (Rustin), Bradley Cooper (Maestro) and Jeffrey Wright (American Fiction).
Murphy also spoke about his son Aran, 16, who is making his film debut in Taika Waititi's Klara And The Sun.
""I'm very proud of him, he's a great actor,"" he told reporters on the Irish-themed green carpet, adding that Aran didn't need his dad's advice.
Brosnan said he was ""greatly honoured"" to be given an Oscar Wilde award for his contributions to the film and TV industry.
He praised the ""kinship"" between Ireland and America, adding that he came to the US in 1982 ""on a wing and a prayer... and then got a job, [on drama series] Remington Steele"".
Speaking about his homeland's rich vein of talent, he told the BBC: ""We come from a landscape of poetry... they're great storytellers.""
The other honourees this year were Irish visual effects supervisor Richie Baneham and Irish-American actress and comedian Molly Shannon.
Shannon, who found fame on Saturday Night Live (SNL) in the 1990s, said she was ""so touched... I feel a deep connection to Ireland"".
Two-time Oscar winner Baneham, joked: ""People keep telling me I'm being upstaged by James Bond (Brosnan) - but truly, I know him as Remington Steele.""
Baneham won his first best visual effects at the Academy Awards for 2009 movie Avatar, and then picked up a win in the same category last year for the long-awaited follow-up, Avatar: The Way of Water. The director of both films, James Cameron, presented Baneham with his honour.
Baneham is also working on the third Avatar film, due to be released in December 2025.
Speaking to the BBC about this year's Oscars crop, he said he had ""a soft spot"" for visual effects nominee Godzilla Minus One ""because it's such a small movie"".
He described Oppenheimer as ""a beast of a movie, it's a massive undertaking"" adding: ""Hopefully Cillian does really well out of it (on Sunday).""
But his top tip? ""Poor Things is a real winner. It's a breath of fresh air as far as filmmaking's concerned.""
And the film has a big Irish hand in it - alongside its star Emma Stone and director Yorgos Lanthimos, are Irish producers Ed Guiney and Andrew Lowe of Element Pictures.
Its 11 Oscar nominations mark a record for an Irish-produced film.

2024-03-13T12:41:53.000Z,Jedward hit back after Louis Walsh calls them 'vile' on Celebrity Big Brother,BBC News,"Irish pop singers Jedward have hit back at former X Factor judge Louis Walsh after he told his fellow Celebrity Big Brother housemates the duo were ""vile"".
The twins, who were mentored by Walsh on the talent show in 2009, called his comments ""spiteful and disrespectful"".
The pair watched Tuesday's episode of Big Brother with TV star Gemma Collins.
In a video filmed afterwards in her hot tub, the singers said: ""You've got to stand up for yourself when someone tries to throw you under the bus.""
Collins added: ""Louis, don't be slagging off my boys. They're not vile or they wouldn't be in my hot tub.""
The row erupted when actor Colson Smith asked Walsh what Jedward were like. ""They were vile... I done five million quid with them, I swear on my mother's life,"" he replied.
""They were vile, they were novelty, they were great for the show.""
The ITV show's live audience were heard booing and chanting ""Get Louis out"" before the results of Tuesday's eviction vote were announced.
However, he was saved in the public vote, with Real Housewives of Cheshire star Lauren Simon leaving instead.
John and Edward Grimes, 32, were teenagers when they appeared on The X Factor, and were later managed by Walsh.
In a string of posts on X, they called him ""cold hearted"" and said he ""didn't even send us flowers when our mom died"".
They added: ""Louis reopened these wounds all by himself being spiteful and disrespectful we aren't going to have our character taken. Justice will be served.""
A representative for Walsh declined to comment.
Walsh, 71, and fellow X Factor judge Sharon Osbourne haven't shied away from giving their opinions about other stars in the Celebrity Big Brother house.
In one of the first episodes, Osbourne and Walsh had a conversation about their X Factor co-star Simon Cowell.
""He would always say 'change, change, change'. You're the one that needs changing, mate,"" Osbourne said.
""Someone who dresses the same for three decades, they don't see that it's not right. No-one's gonna tell him, but everything, the same, the same, the same.""
Walsh, nodding along, said he no longer speaks to Cowell: ""I haven't talked to him at all, nothing. Zero.""
In another conversation, Osbourne and Walsh laid into actor and presenter James Corden, Vogue magazine's editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, and TV host Ellen DeGeneres, whose name prompted Osbourne to pretend to vomit.
Osbourne, 71, who was referred to as ""celebrity lodger"" by ITV, left the show on Tuesday after eight days.
She reportedly said she didn't want ""to stay away from Ozzy for too long"". Her rock star husband has Parkinson's disease, and has had a string of operations to correct spinal damage.
""It's just been so better than I could've ever imagined,"" she will be seen telling Big Brother in Wednesday's episode.
The other housemates included the Princess of Wales' uncle Gary Goldsmith, who was the first celebrity to be voted out on Friday.
The show, which is airing on ITV after a six-year hiatus, has attracted the biggest audience in over a decade, with 3.8 million viewers tuning in to last week's launch.

2024-03-07T00:45:53.000Z,Oscars 2024: Are films now 'too long' as Hugh Grant suggests?,BBC News,"""Oompa-loompa, doompity-dee, now the best director categor-ee. Oompa Loompa doompity-dong, most of these films were frankly too long.""
Fresh from starring in Wonka, Hugh Grant's (life-size) onstage appearance at the Baftas not only saw him revive his inner Oompa Loompa when delivering the award for best director, but also openly question the length of this year's awards season contenders.
He may have been thinking of the evening's eventual winner, Christopher Nolan's three-hour epic Oppenheimer, which is also expected to sweep the Oscars this weekend.
But three of the five other Bafta nominees - The Holdovers, Maestro, and Anatomy of a Fall - likewise Oscar contenders, also clock in at over two hours each.
Good thing, perhaps, that Grant didn't have to confront Martin Scorsese's American introspective, Killers of the Flower Moon, an Academy favourite despite its 3hr 26min runtime - the longest of this year's best picture contenders.
But are this year's nominated films part of a (growing) trend? If so, what does this mean for audiences, cinemas and directors?
A rainy afternoon trip to the cinema may have reliably lured families, couples and single souls for decades, but film durations have fluctuated throughout this time.
The sense of screenings themselves becoming an all-day event can first be traced back to the 1960s, as directors revelled in a golden age for the silver screen.
Lawrence of Arabia ran beyond three-and-a-half hours in 1962. Cleopatra, released a year later, originally stretched to four before being cut down.
Intermissions were central to this experience as projectionists transferred over physical reels, giving audiences a natural rest break for the loo and the chance to buy ice cream.
But advancements in projector technology meant intermissions were no longer needed, and this staple of movie-going was phased out, with 1982's Gandhi thought to be the last major western feature to include an intermission as standard.
In the intervening decades, film lengths have steadily increased, quite literally keeping audiences in their seats.
Phil Clapp, chief executive of the UK Cinema Association, told the BBC its members are engaged in ""ongoing discussions"" with studios, distributors and others relevant parties about potentially reintroducing ""structured intermissions"", possibly for films lasting three hours or more.
An analysis by The Economist of over 100,000 feature films released internationally since the 1930s found current popular movie runtimes to be the highest on record.
And there's been a significant spike in recent years. Statista research across the decades reveals that, on average, the highest-grossing movies in the US and Canada have grown by around 30 minutes since 2020 alone, hitting 2hrs 23mins by 2023.
It's not only franchise blockbusters that are responsible (yes, Indiana Jones, John Wick and Avengers: Endgame, we're looking at you), but Oscar nominated films.
Avatar: The Way of Water, 2023's longest best picture nominee also hit the three-hour mark.
""We've seen epic filmmaking do well at the Oscars in every decade,"" says Karie Bible, box office analyst at Exhibitor Relations. ""The very first film to win best picture in 1927 was an aviation epic called Wings that ran for two hours and 24 minutes.""
""Epic films often mean epic storytelling,"" she explains. ""These films are larger than life and often encompass a long, developed story that ask people to be emotionally invested.""
But this artistic rationale is being pushed to its limits - with audience bladders left bursting as directors are empowered like never before.
The Cold War between streaming and cinema over the past decade has made the name behind the camera almost as coveted as any A-list actor.
As streaming services vie with Hollywood for credibility and prestige they've thrown huge amounts of money at directing talent - often far outmatching anything a legacy studio can offer - with success.
Before Scorsese partnered with Apple for Killers of the Flower Moon, he turned to Netflix to fund his Oscar nominated three-and-a-half-hour mob movie The Irishman, telling the BBC he ""couldn't get financing"" from Hollywood to match his ambition.
The template has similarly tempted David Fincher, Rian Johnson and latterly Ridley Scott - who has hinted at releasing a four-hour cut of Napoleon on Apple TV, despite his original version already being nearly three hours.
The dynamic can weaken producer control and inflate runtimes. In his podcast review for Killers of the Flower Moon, Mark Kermode explained: ""We hear stories about... people making films for studios for theatrical exhibition, then you end up having fights with the producers about [length]. If you're a streaming service, they don't care.""
This challenge comes at a hefty price for traditional film studios, at a time when tinseltown is having to find a delicate balance between squeezed costs - exacerbated by the pandemic - last year's strikes and the challenge of tempting people away from lockdown-inspired home streaming.
""Casual moviegoing, where you wait until the weekend to pick what to see, has pretty much been supplanted by streaming,"" Erin Brockovich producer Michael Shamberg told Vanity Fair's Natalie Jarvey for her aptly named article: Why Are Movies Sooooo Long?
""Now when you leave your house to pay to see a movie, you want an emotional sure thing for your time and effort. You also want a bigger experience than streaming a movie in your living room,"" he added.
The knock-on effect of ""event"" cinema, increasingly tied to social media buzz, sees the industry - and cinemas themselves - reliant on goldrush titles, be it Top Gun: Maverick post-lockdown or Oppenheimer last year, to mask over the cracks of reduced pulling power.
And even taking Nolan's popularity as a director into account, the mainstream success of Oppenheimer, on paper, a three-hour historical biopic, benefitted hugely from the Barbenheimer phenomenon: an accidental marketing dream.
Outside that near one-off event, the overwhelming temptation to ""go long"" seems to be partially wearing thin, with cinemas, audiences and directors.
Cinema chains, says Clapp, can struggle with a flurry of longer films, as this ""means less screenings"", choice and ultimately tickets sold - only a fraction of which can be made up by popcorn and fizzy drinks, or luxury seating.
""We would never want to dictate creative licence, but there's a desire amongst a proportion of the audience for a break,"" he says, pointing to the potential for intermissions, and their confectionery window.
Cinema chain Vue was among a handful worldwide to forgo distribution agreements and trial intervals during Killers of the Flower Moon.
""Analysis showed customers would like to see the return of intermissions,"" Vue's chief executive, Tim Richards, told The Guardian last October. ""We've seen 74% positive feedback from those who have tried our interval.""
Clapp describes it as a ""live debate"" especially with intermissions remaining in other global markets.
""The concern is that wherever you drop the curtain, so to speak, you'll kill the narrative structure, but this doesn't need to be the case with careful planning - arguably people getting up midway through a film causes more disruption,"" he says.
Scorsese, for his part, urged viewers to show ""commitment"" to cinema, lambasting complaints in light of TV binge-watching at home.
""You can sit in front of the TV and watch something for five hours… there are many people who watch theatre for 3.5 hours … give cinema some respect,"" he told Hindustan Times.
But not every director agrees. As Holdovers' mastermind Alexander Payne bemoaned: ""There are too many damn long movies these days."" Lengthy runtimes, he added, should always be ""the shortest possible version"".
For Nolan, the relationship with the audience remains foremost in his mind: ""I view myself as the audience. I make the films that I would really... want to watch,"" he told BBC Culture editor Katie Razzall.
For younger audiences however, frequently cast as rejecting long-form viewing in the age of TikTok and YouTube shorts, Nolan's epics - often near three hours - should not appeal.
But Dune director Denis Villeneuve says Oppenheimer's success proves the opposite. He argues younger audiences value watching and paying for longer films, provided they offer ""something substantial"". ""They are craving meaningful content,"" he told The Times.
Dune: Part Two, released last week, outlasts the original film's 155-minute runtime by ten minutes, providing five hours of desert adventure in total.
One nationwide chain, Showcase Cinemas, offered both instalments back-to-back across the opening night.

2024-03-11T13:45:05.000Z,"Oscars after-parties: Emma Stone, Cillian Murphy and Billie Eilish celebrate their victories",BBC News,"After the Oscars, the stars hit Hollywood to celebrate their victories - or drown their sorrows.
Robert Downey Jr, who won best supporting actor for his role in Oppenheimer was amongst the lucky few who got to party with their very own statuette.
Earlier in the evening, he'd posed for a selfie backstage with former supporting actor recipients Ke Huy Quan, Sam Rockwell, Mahershala Ali, Christoph Waltz and Tim Robbins.
Billie Eilish was accosted by Public Enemy rapper Flava Flav at the Vanity Fair afterparty, who gifted her one of his trademark timepieces.
Emma Stone, who won best actress for Poor Things, said on stage that she'd suffered a wardrobe malfunction while dancing to Ryan Gosling's performance of I'm Just Ken.
So it was lucky that she had a change of outfit ready to go for the Vanity Fair red carpet.
Margot Robbie also went for a change of outfit, ditching the all-black ensemble she wore to the ceremony (allegedly in protest at the lack of nominations for Barbie) for a gold corset that was reminiscent of the Oscar statue itself.
Over at the Governors Ball, Takashi Yamazaki posed with a miniature Godzilla and a life-size Christopher Nolan and Emma Thomas. Yamazaki had earlier won best visual effects for the monster movie Godzilla Minus One, while Nolan and Thomas picked up best picture for Oppenheimer.
Da'Vine Joy Randolph was all smiles as she posed with her best supporting actress trophy. The former Broadway star was recognised for her role in the comedy-drama The Holdovers, where she plays a cafeteria manager and bereaved mother.
Ten years after Ellen De Generes' Oscar selfie broke the internet, the stars are still lining up to take photos of each other. Here, Chris Hemsworth grabs a shot of his Thor co-star Matt Damon, alongside their respective wives, the actress Elsa Pataky (left) and Luciana Barosso (right).
Meanwhile, Arthur Harari and Justine Triet - who won best screenplay for the courtroom thriller Anatomy Of A Fall - posed their Oscar statuettes in a passionate embrace. The magic of storytelling.
Cillian Murphy - pictured here pretending to recognise someone who's name he can't remember - became the first Irish star to win the Oscar for best actor, for his role in Oppenheimer. He celebrated the occasion with the film's editor Jennifer Lame, who also picked up an Oscar for her work.
Earlier in the evening, Emily Blunt raised eyebrows with a dress that looked like it had underpants sewn into the fabric, Superman-style. She switched to a more traditional outfit for the Vanity Fair Party, while her husband John Krasinski opted for a white tux.
One of the great things about the Oscars after parties is that its not just for the nominees.  Singer Demi Lovato was on the guestlist at the 2024 Vanity Fair Oscar Party and cut a striking figure on the red carpet.
Sheer looks have been all the rage at this year's Oscars - and rapper Ice Spice, who features on the Barbie soundtrack, will be glad she got the memo after turning up in this lacy black outfit.
Fresh from reprising his role as a Ken alongside Ryan Gosling at the awards ceremony, Simu Liu was pictured with his partner Allison Hsu.
Kim Kardashian recently made her acting debut in the TV show American Horror Story, so it's not out of the question that she'll finds her next role after a bit of networking at the Vanity Fair party.
Much like the rest of us, Saltburn's Barry Keoghan has jumped on the Taylor Swift friendship bracelet-making bandwagon. Bonus points for guessing what his says, though...
Lily Gladstone was one of the favourites to win best actress for her soulful performance in Martin Scorcese's Killers Of The Flower Moon. There were no bad feelings between her and Emma Stone, though. The pair hugged it out at the Oscars, before Gladstone left to attend Vanity Fair's party.
Over at Elton John's Oscar party, Gladstone's co-star Cara Jade Myers, looked incredibly elegant in her billowing red gown.
Actress and model Paris Jackson didn't leave much to the imagination with her outfit choice, also opting for a sheer, thigh-high split look.
Also in attendance was British actress and former Bond star Jane Seymour. As a former Emmy and Golden Globe winner, she'll be in good company at the evening's parties.
Heidi Klum and her husband Tom Kaulitz also attended Sir Elton's 32nd annual Oscars viewing party, which is held in West Hollywood, just down the road from the ceremony, and raises money for his Aids foundation.
They were joined by Elizabeth Hurley and her son Damian who, much like his mother, has found fame as a model.

Emma Stone (above) was among the best-dressed in a custom Louis Vuitton pale mint peplum gown. She was later named best actress for Poor Things.
Margot Robbie was controversially not nominated for her role in Barbie, but she was one of the fashion winners in a black sequined Versace gown.
Co-star Ryan Gosling brought some 'Kenergy' in a classic black outfit with sparkly silver trim.
In a nod to the preppy style of 1995 film Clueless, Billie Eilish's outfit included a Chanel tweed blazer, tall socks and heeled Mary Jane shoes. The singer won best song for her Barbie theme What Was I Made For?
America Ferrera wore a shimmering pink gown in a tribute to Barbie. Ferrera had a best supporting actress nomination for her role in the film.
Da'Vine Joy Randolph continued her ability to bring dramatic looks to red carpets this awards season, wearing a shimmering periwinkle dress with pom-pom sleeves and a long train. She went on to scoop the prize for best supporting actress.
Best actress nominee Lily Gladstone honoured her Native American heritage by wearing a collaboration between Gucci creative director Sabato De Sarno and Indigenous artist Joe Big Mountain.
Bradley Cooper, who was nominated for best actor for Maestro, wore a black suit without a tie but with turquoise buttons to add a modern twist. His mother Gloria was his date.
Cooper's Maestro co-star Carey Mulligan, who was up for best actress, oozed elegance in a black-and-white mermaid dress.
Jennifer Lawrence brought polka dots to the red carpet with a gorgeous Dior gown.
Dune star Zendaya chose a single-strapped striking rose Armani Privé dress with a metallic palm tree pattern.
Her Dune co-star Florence Pugh strode down the red carpet in a sculpted and beaded Del Core design.
Emily Blunt and husband John Krasinski had a matching cream look, with the best supporting actress nominee in a structured Schiaparelli gown with Superman-style underwear detailing.
Paul Giamatti, who walked the carpet with actress and girlfriend Clara Wong, was among the favourites in the best actor category for his role in The Holdovers.
Cillian Murphy, who won best actor for his role in Oppenheimer, looked dapper in traditional suit and bow tie.
Last year's best actor winner Brendan Fraser returned with his partner Jeanne Moore.
Last year's best actress winner Michelle Yeoh also returned, wearing a silver custom Balenciaga Couture gown.
Lupita Nyong'o arrived with Stranger Things actor Joseph Quinn - her co-star in the forthcoming A Quiet Place prequel, Day One.
Anya Taylor Joy, who was one of the night's presenters, wore a strapless sequined Dior Haute Couture ball gown.
Jamie Lee Curtis won best supporting actress last year, and was among the presenters this time.
Dwayne ""the Rock"" Johnson sported a silk slate three-piece suit and a burgundy silk scarf.
Singer Ariana Grande channelled Glinda the Good Witch, her character in the new Wicked films, in a custom Giambattista Valli Haute Couture creation.
Her Wicked co-star Cynthia Erivo wore a green leather Louis Vuitton design - a nod to her character Elphaba.
Pitch Perfect star Brittany Snow co-ordinated with the Oscars statuettes in a dazzling gold dress.
Snow stars in Oscar-nominated short film Red, White and Blue, which was made by British director Nazrin Choudhury.
Eugene Lee Yang made a dramatic entrance in a voluminous burgundy statement skirt and matching jacket. He voices a heroic knight in Netflix's animated sci-fi comedy Nimona, which was nominated for best animated feature.
English actress Andrea Riseborough, who was nominated for best actress last year, adapted a Scottish tartan pattern in her polo neck dress.
High School Musical star Vanessa Hudgens - who co-hosted the official pre-show coverage - revealed her pregnancy with a full-length black gown that showed off her baby bump. The actress is married to baseball player Cole Tucker.
Julianne Hough, co-host of the official red carpet show alongside Hudgens, wore billowing white trousers with shimmery detailing around the bust.
Actress and host Liza Koshy took a tumble on the red carpet, but she managed to style it out.
Grace Linn was probably the oldest person to attend this year's ceremony at 101. She inspired and appears in The ABCs of Book Banning, which was up for best documentary short, and her outfit was a testament to her love of books.
West Side Story star Rita Moreno - who won an Oscar 62 years ago - is 92 years young.
Sean Wang made as short film about moving in with his grandmothers during Covid - and they are all at the Oscars after Nai Nai & Wài Pó was nominated for best documentary short.
British influencer Amelia Dimoldenberg, best known for her Chicken Shop Dates series, fronted the Oscars' official social media campaign. She plumped for a classic full-length dress in pink.
Members of the Native American Osage Nation brought some of their traditional finery to the red carpet. Martin Scorsese's Killers of the Flower Moon, which tells the story of the persecution of the Osage Nation in the 1920s, was up for 10 awards but did not end winning any.

2024-02-29T12:28:10.000Z,"The Hairy Bikers star Dave Myers, who had cancer, dies at 66",BBC News,"Dave Myers, one half of TV cooking duo The Hairy Bikers, has died at the age of 66, two years after revealing he had been diagnosed with cancer.
Myers, from Barrow-in-Furness, found fame alongside Si King 20 years ago.
The bearded pair were known for travelling around the UK and the world on their motorbikes, sampling and cooking food from different regions.
King said he ""will miss him every day and the bond and friendship we shared over half a lifetime"".
Others paying tribute included fellow celebrity chef James Martin, who called him ""a very special man"".
The Great British Bake Off judge Paul Hollywood said he was ""gutted"".
The Great British Menu host Andi Oliver wrote that she was ""so so sad to hear"" the news, adding: ""My heart goes out to you all xx.""
Food critic Jay Rayner remembered Myers as ""a brilliant cook, a superb communicator and most of all a seriously lovely man"".
Strictly Come Dancing's Karen Hauer, who partnered Myers on the show in 2013, said she was ""heartbroken"".
Announcing the news on Thursday, King wrote: ""I'm afraid I bear some sad news. Most of you will know Dave has been fighting cancer for the past couple of years.""
He ""passed away peacefully at home"" on Wednesday with wife Lili, family and close friends at his side, King wrote.
""All who knew Dave are devastated at his passing. His beloved wife brought him such happiness as did her children, Iza and Sergiu who Dave loved like his own.
""Personally, I am not sure I can put into words on how I feel at the moment. My best friend is on a journey that for now, I can't follow.
""I will miss him every day and the bond and friendship we shared over half a lifetime. I wish you God's speed brother; you are and will remain a beacon in this world. See you on the other side. Love ya.""
King continued that Myers would want him to thank everyone who sent messages of support during his illness. ""We are eternally grateful for them.""
He added: ""May I ask you all for one further kindness and allow Lili, his wife, his family, close friends and I some time and some peace to process our huge loss. I am sure I will see you all soon.""
The pair's latest series, The Hairy Bikers Go West, started this month and sees them travel down the UK's west coast.
In the first episode, he told viewers it was ""a dream come true"" to be back on his motorbike because he ""wasn't sure I'd ever get back in the saddle again"".
""There was a time I couldn't balance, I couldn't walk, I didn't think I'd be getting on a bike,"" he said.
Myers and King met in the 1990s and went on to become household names while presenting The Hairy Bikers' Cookbook on BBC TV together.
The pilot episode was broadcast in 2005 before the first full series went out in 2006, and saw them ride across countries including Romania, Ireland and Namibia.
Future series included The Hairy Bikers Ride Again, The Hairy Bikers' Food Tour of Britain, The Hairy Bikers: Mums Know Best, The Hairy Bikers' Asian Adventure and Hairy Bikers: Best of British.
The Hairy Bikers published more than 30 recipe books, selling more than six million copies, and documented their weight loss in Hairy Dieters: How To Love Food And Lose Weight.
Myers also fronted a show called The Hairy Builder, about historic buildings.
Paying tribute, BBC chief content officer Charlotte Moore said: ""Everyone at the BBC is incredibly sad to hear this news.
""Dave made cooking a truly joyful adventure and he shared that joy with millions. The public loved him and his unique partnership with Si.
""Together they made every viewer feel like a friend. More than that he was simply a lovely man. Our thoughts go out to his family and many friends.""
Viewers also paid tribute, with one writing on X that ""Si and Dave have been a big part of me learning to cook, and their recipes a source of joy among my family"".
Another posted: ""Rest in peace mate, you and Si are directly responsible for so much of my love of cooking.""
Myers gained a love of food at an early age from his mother, a crane driver at the local shipyard as well as an excellent cook. His father, the foreman of a paper mill, would take him on fishing trips the back of his motorbike.
But when his mum developed multiple sclerosis, the responsibility for food shopping and cooking fell to Myers around the age of 12.
Alongside his dad, he was a young carer for his mother. ""In those days there wasn't much support for that,"" he told BBC Radio 4 in 2019. ""It was very hard, really. I've got a lot of sympathy for young carers today.""
Around that time, Myers developed alopecia, which doctors put down to the shock of his mother's illness.
""There's an irony, as a Hairy Biker,"" he said. ""I had no hair, no eyebrows, no eyelashes.""
He remained largely bald until his early 40s, when he had an operation to remove a cyst from his brain - which he suspected may have been the cause of the alopecia all along.
""My hair grew back complete as it is now with male pattern baldness. So that's the story of the unhairy Hairy Biker.""
After leaving home, Myers studied fine art at Goldsmiths in London, before spotting an advert to train as a make-up artist at the BBC.
He had little experience of make-up and was surprised to get the job. ""Much to my amazement I turned up for work and I was the first male make-up artist at Television Centre.""
He stayed for 23 years, working on shows ranging from Doctor Who to period dramas, and was said to have once painted the white stripe on pop star Adam Ant's face.
It was while doing make-up for a TV adaptation of Catherine Cookson's The Gambling Man that Myers met King, who was employed as a second assistant director.
The pair ""got on like a house on fire"", Myers said, and they began going on road trips to sample food in different places. One day, they had an idea - what if they filmed themselves on their foodie excursions.
They pitched a TV show to several producers they had previously worked with. ""And we never looked back.""
Myers met future wife Liliana Orzac while filming The Hairy Bikers in Romania, and she was the manager of the hotel.
""For many years my biggest regret in life was the fact I hadn't had children,"" he once said. ""But when I married Lil I had this ready-made family with two stepchildren and it brought me such joy.""

2024-03-04T11:56:28.000Z,"Dan Wootton: GB News show with Laurence Fox breached rules, Ofcom says",BBC News,"An episode of Dan Wootton Tonight on GB News broke broadcasting rules, media regulator Ofcom has concluded.
Comments made during the programme by Laurence Fox about a female political journalist, Ava Evans, prompted 8,867 complaints to Ofcom.
Viewers complained his remarks were sexist, misogynistic and offensive.
Ofcom said his remarks ""constituted a highly personal attack on Ms Evans and were potentially highly offensive to viewers"".
The broadcasting regulator also said it has ""significant concerns about GB News' editorial control of its live output"" and is requiring the channel to ""provide further detailed information about its compliance practices in this area"".
Fox, an actor turned politician, drew condemnation after asking what ""self-respecting man"" would ""climb into bed"" with her, during a live show on 26 September.
Wootton could be seen smiling and laughing throughout Fox's remarks, before adding for ""a touch of balance"" that Evans had qualified her comments, and called her a ""very beautiful woman"".
""[The comments] reduced her contribution to a broadcast discussion on mental health - in her professional capacity as a political journalist - to a judgment on whether she, or women like her who publicly expressed their political opinions, were sexually desirable to men,"" Ofcom said in its ruling.
""As such, we considered that Mr Fox's comments were degrading and demeaning both to Ms Evans and women generally and were clearly and unambiguously misogynistic.""
Ofcom added that Mr Wootton's reaction and limited challenge ""did not mitigate the potential for offence"" and instead ""exacerbated it by contributing to the narrative in which a woman's value was judged by her physical appearance"".
It added that ""no apology was made after the interview with Mr Fox in the remainder of the two-hour programme - nor were any other editorial techniques used to address the potential for offence"".
Following the comments, GB News suspended both presenters from the channel and said the insults were ""totally unacceptable"".
The publisher for the MailOnline also announced it had sacked Wootton, who had previously written a column for the newspaper since 2021, ""following events this week"".
The 41-year-old remains suspended from GB News, while Mr Fox was sacked in September.
In a statement, Evans, who is PoliticsJOE's political correspondent, told BBC News she was ""pleased"" that Ofcom had recognised that the remarks made were sexist.
""My journalism is open to criticism, and it's important that takes place in a free and fair society, but remarks of this nature only serve to stifle meaningful debate and dissuade young women from choosing journalism as a career,"" she said. ""That is to all of our detriment"".
She added that Ofcom needs to do be able to ""impose meaningful sanctions for conduct of this kind, not just slap its perpetrators on the wrist, should they be unwilling to change their behaviour"".
At the time of the events, Evans told the BBC the comments made her feel ""disgusting"" and she had since received threats online, including a message telling her to ""watch her back"".
The regulator said it is also investigating a number of other complaints including whether Nigel Farage broke rules requiring news and current affairs to be presented with due impartiality during a show on GB News in January.
In September, Ofcom confirmed to the BBC it had 12 investigations still open into GB News, which launched promising to ""change the face of news and debate in the UK"".
Ofcom launched the investigation into Wootton's show under rule 2.3 of the Broadcasting Code, in which broadcasters must ensure material which may cause offence is justified by the context.
The episode was the most complained about broadcast of 2023.
This is the second time that Ofcom has asked GB News ""attend a meeting at our offices"". It first made the request in May 2023 after Ofcom found the broadcaster had breached rules when it aired ""unopposed"" claims about the Covid-19 vaccine from guest Dr Naomi Wolf.
The BBC has asked GB News, Dan Wootton and Laurence Fox for comment.

2024-03-12T09:16:47.000Z,"What is Eurovision, and where and when is the 2024 final taking place?",BBC News,"A year after Eurovision fans descended on Liverpool for a hugely successful event hosted on behalf of Ukraine, the annual song contest is heading to Sweden.
Singer Olly Alexander is representing the UK.
Israel has unveiled a revised song, after its original entry was rejected for breaching the contest's political-neutrality rules.
The Eurovision Song Contest is an annual televised song writing competition which is organised by The European Broadcasting Union (EBU).
The 2024 contest features 37 performers chosen by EBU member broadcasters to represent their country.
Songs must be original and no more than three minutes long.
Lead vocals must be performed live, and a maximum of six singers and dancers can be on stage during the performance.
Most Eurovision countries are European. But Australia takes part every year after being invited to send an act to the 2015 contest for Eurovision's 60th anniversary celebrations.
However, Australia cannot host. If it ever won, it would have to nominate a European nation to stage the contest on its behalf.
Other non-European countries including Israel are allowed to participate because they are members of the EBU.
The 2024 contest is being held in Sweden after Loreen won in 2023 with her song Tattoo.
She became the first woman to win the contest twice, after triumphing in 2012 with Euphoria.
This is the third time Malmo has hosted Eurovision, and the seventh time the contest has been held in Sweden.
As 2024 is the 50th anniversary of Swedish group Abba's first Eurovision win with Waterloo, there had been speculation about the band's potential involvement.
But Abba members Bjorn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson told the BBC they would neither perform at the final, nor compose Sweden's entry.
The grand final will be held in the Malmo Arena on Saturday 11 May.
The semi-finals will take place on Tuesday 7 and Thursday 9 May.
Both semi-finals and the grand final will be broadcast live on BBC One and BBC iPlayer.
Pop star Olly Alexander is representing the UK at the 2024 contest, with his song Dizzy.
The former Years and Years frontman is hoping to improve on the UK's disappointing performance in 2023, when Mae Muller came second to last.
Alexander is well-known around Europe for hits including Desire, King and If You're Over Me.
He is also a Bafta-nominated actor, having played the lead role in Channel 4's hard-hitting Aids drama It's A Sin.
Israel's representative, Eden Golan, will now sing a song called Hurricane - a rewritten version of the country's original entry, October Rain, which was thought to reference the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel.
The lyrics now tell the story of a woman experiencing a personal crisis, according to Israel's public broadcaster, Kan.
Kan initially said it would withdraw from the contest rather than change the lyrics.
But after the organisers barred the song for its political content, the country's President, Isaac Herzog, called for ""necessary adjustments"" to ensure Israel could compete.
Separately, musicians from a number of participating countries have called for Israel to be suspended over the war in Gaza.
In December, Iceland's Association of Composers and Lyricists published a statement saying Israel's military action made its participation incompatible with an event ""characterised by joy and optimism"".
Similar objections have been raised in Finland, Norway, Denmark and Sweden, with many pointing out that Russia has been disqualified since its invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
So far, Eurovision organisers have resisted calls for Israel's exclusion, saying the situations in Ukraine and Gaza are different.
The semi-finals are decided entirely by a public vote from competing countries and people in the rest of the world.
For the final, every country which qualifies awards two sets of scores: one from a jury of experts and one by fans.
Each of their 10 favourite songs is given points - but they can't vote for their own country's song.
Their favourite act receives 12 points, their second-favourite ten points, their third choice eight points, and then seven points, and so on, down to one point for their tenth favourite.
Eurovision was one of the first televised competitions to let viewers vote.
Fans in Austria, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK began voting by phone in 1997.
The rest of the world was allowed to vote in 2023, with points given to the 10 most popular songs worldwide.
Each participating broadcaster pays an entrance fee to the EBU. France, Germany, Italy, Spain and UK pay the most, although the BBC does not make its contribution public.
BBC News was told that other countries were asked to pay more after Russia's suspension. Three countries pulled out of the 2023 contest as a result.
It is thought staging the 2023 event in Liverpool cost the BBC between £8m and £17m. The UK government pledged £10m towards operational costs, while local authorities in Liverpool committed £4m.

2024-03-11T04:17:20.000Z,"Ryan Gosling, John Cena nudity and a dog who stole the Oscars",BBC News,"This year's Oscars brought more than three hours of glamour, tears, and full-frontal nudity. Here are some of the best moments from the biggest night in Hollywood.
We all knew it was coming but Ryan Gosling's full-throated rendition of the Barbie movie's hit I'm Just Ken was even better than we could have hoped for.
He started out the Oscar-nominated original song sitting just behind Barbie co-star Margot Robbie, who could not seem to control her laughter as Gosling crooned into her ear.
Carrying on in his all-pink tuxedo, Gosling made his way to the stage where he danced a choreographed routine with a dozen accompanying cowboy-hat-wearing Kens transforming the sometimes stuffy evening into a rousing concert. And, if that wasn't enough, Slash appeared to lend his talents for a guitar solo.
There were even suggestions the choreography was a homage to Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend.
The Kenergy was infectious - Gosling solicited energetic singalongs from the star-studded front row, including best actress winner Emma Stone and Barbie's director, Greta Gerwig.
Stone even had a wardrobe malfunction due to all the excitement - as she walked up to the stage to collect her best actress nomination, she was struggling with the back of her dress.
Appearing backstage, she said: ""They sewed me back in! I genuinely think I busted it during I'm Just Ken. I was so amazed by Ryan and that number just blew my mind. I was just going for it and things just happen!""
Jimmy Kimmel returned to the Dolby Theatre for his fourth turn as Oscars' host.
He's had some practice and it showed. Kimmel nodded to the months-long strikes that brought Hollywood (nearly) to a halt in his tone-setting monologue, celebrating the actors and writers who had pushed for a deal.
""As a result, actors no longer have to worry about getting replaced by AI,"" he said. ""Thanks to this historic agreement, actors are now able to go back to worrying about being replaced by younger, more attractive people.""
Kimmel also got into a spat with Donald Trump that went viral. In response to the former US President posting on Truth Social: ""Has there EVER been a WORSE HOST than Jimmy Kimmel?"", the comic quipped back on stage: ""Isn't it past your jail time?""
But not all his jokes landed. A jab at Robert Downey Jr and his history of substance abuse drew some blank stares from the crowd, and a ""wrap it up"" from Downey Jr himself.
Downey Jr was the only winner who didn't come to the winners' room to speak to the press later. Although he skipped it at the Baftas too. Maybe he's just too cool for skool.
The streets of Hollywood were flooded with demonstrators protesting Israel's war in Gaza, snarling traffic and slowing the arrival of several stars.
Protesters chanting ""ceasefire now"" walked down Sunset Boulevard to the sound of honking horns, while Los Angeles police stood by in riot gear.
There were reminders of the conflict inside the ceremony too, with several big-name stars including Billie Eilish, Mark Ruffalo and Ramy Youssef sporting red pins in support of a ceasefire (Artists4Ceasefire) between Israel and Hamas.
The pins were from Artists4Ceasefire, a group of stars and others who work in the entertainment industry who signed an open letter urging President Biden to call for a ceasefire.
Israeli-American founder of Marvel Entertainment, Avi Arad, wore a yellow ribbon, to raise awareness of the hostages who are still being held by Hamas since the 7 October attack on Israel.
And the war was noted from the Oscars stage itself, as the British director Jonathan Glazer accepted the best international film statue for his film The Zone of Interest, which follows the domestic life of a Nazi officer and his family.
Glazer, who is Jewish, said he rejected his ""Jewishness and the Holocaust being hijacked by an occupation which has led to conflict for so many innocent people"".
""Whether the victims of October 7th in Israel, or the ongoing attack on Gaza, all the victims of this dehumanisation, how do we resist?""
The Oscars made lots of super-fans happy this year by returning to an old presenting format, with past winners announcing the nominees for the four acting categories. The personal tributes gave us some nice moments of real emotion from the stars.
This was especially true for Da'Vine Joy Randolph who was moved to tears by a heart-felt introduction from Lupita Nyong'o.
Randolph had us crying ourselves moments later when she accepted the trophy for best supporting actress - her first win after her first nomination.
""I didn't think I was supposed to do this as a career,"" she said in her speech. ""For so long, I've always wanted to be different, and now I realise I just need to be myself. And I thank you. I thank you for seeing me.""
Backstage, she spoke about encouraging creatives from under-represented backgrounds to keep going: ""The beautiful thing that erupts is your imagination and creativity because you don't have much…. Something I think as black people, we are very good at, is making a lot out of very little. It's our superpower.""
The award for costume design won't be easily forgotten this year, thanks to the presentation by John Cena.
Prompted by Kimmel, Cena - a wrestler and actor - appeared on stage entirely naked, save for a pair of Birkenstocks and a strategically placed envelope carrying the name of the winner.
Cena shuffled on stage to the sound of roaring laughter, before a quick exchange with Kimmel - one of the better sketches of the evening.
""The male body is not supposed to be funny,"" Cena said.
""Mine is,"" Kimmel replied.
It wasn't the only moment of the night that had people sitting up in their chairs. Al Pacino nearly gave us a panic attack right at the end of the ceremony.
We still haven't recovered from the Moonlight/La La Land mix-up back in 2017.  So when Pacino hesitated before announcing Oppenheimer as the best picture winner - and then uttered his announcement so casually - there was a sharp intake of breath in the auditorium. Thankfully, no-one rushed on to the stage to correct him. Phew.
The best picture-nominated Anatomy of a Fall boasted a four-legged break-out star: Messi, the black-and-white border collie who plays Snoop the dog in the French courtroom drama.
Following days of speculation over whether he would show, Messi appeared at the ceremony, sitting in a plush red seat with a black bow-tie around his neck.
Messi even got some screen time later in the evening. The camera panned to him to show his paws up in applause for Robert Downey Jr's best supporting actor win.
Gosling also looked delighted to see Messi again, having previously made his acquaintance at the Oscars Luncheon last month.

2024-03-07T11:19:30.000Z,"Adam Sandler's Netflix hits make him Hollywood's best-paid actor, Forbes says",BBC News,"Adam Sandler may not be up for any Oscars this weekend for Netflix's Murder Mystery 2 - but he can console himself with the fact that the rom-com-thriller sequel helped make him the best-paid actor in Hollywood last year, according to Forbes magazine.
Sandler's success on Netflix, appearing in and producing three films for the streamer in 2023, contributed to his $73m (£57m) earnings, Forbes said.
That put him above Barbie star Margot Robbie, who at 33 is the youngest person in the top 10 by a decade.
She was also a producer on Barbie, which was the biggest box office hit of 2023, and cult hit Saltburn.
Tom Cruise is third on the Forbes list, with Robbie's Barbie co-star Ryan Gosling joint fourth with Matt Damon, and Sandler's Murder Mystery castmate Jennifer Aniston in sixth.
Sandler and Aniston play hapless husband-and-wife private detectives in the enjoyably throwaway film series.
Murder Mystery 2 was Netflix's fifth most-watched film of last year, with 173 million hours viewed.
The film was never likely to trouble the Oscars voters and was panned by some critics - with The Observer calling it a ""crass comedy caper"" and CNN saying the best thing about it ""is that it's mercifully short"".
Other reviewers were pleasantly surprised, however. The Los Angeles Times admitted its stars ""are better than they need to be"", while Vulture demanded to know: ""How dare Murder Mystery 2 be any good?""
Last year, Sandler's lucrative relationship with Netflix also saw him write, produce and voice animation Leo; and appear in and produce comedy You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah.
This year, he has already starred in sci-fi drama Spaceman - also for Netflix.
""There's no such thing as too much Sandler,"" the company said when renewing his deal following the success of 2019's original Murder Mystery.
His earnings were boosted by 44 stand-up comedy dates last year, Forbes reported.
It is the first time Sandler has topped the magazine's list since 2002.
Tyler Perry was best-paid in 2022, with Dwayne Johnson on top for the three years before that. But neither star is in the latest top 10.

2024-03-09T01:20:54.000Z,Neil Corbould: The Brit competing against himself at this year's Oscars,BBC News,"It's not every day you get nominated for an Oscar. But special effects supervisor Neil Corbould has gone one - or should we say two - better.
The Briton has been nominated for three Oscars in this year's visual effects category, describing the experience to the BBC as ""quite unbelievable"".
He is recognised for his work on Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One, The Creator and Napoleon.
He joked that competing against himself was probably ""the kiss of death.""
""It's amazing to be nominated three times,"" he told me in the opulent lobby of his hotel on Hollywood Boulevard.
The suggestion that perhaps the pressure is off given Corbould's numerous previous nominations and Oscar wins (for Gladiator and Gravity) is quickly dismissed: ""I'm very competitive, so I always want to win.""
He has no idea where he's going to sit at the ceremony on Sunday: ""I might have three seats and have to play musical chairs!""
But the biggest plus? ""I get invited to three different after parties.""
Neil got into special effects after his uncle Colin Chilvers (who later won an Oscar himself for his efforts) took him on to the set of the 1978 Superman movie.
""I was a big Superman fan as a youngster and I kept bugging him to take me into work with him, which he did eventually. The first set I saw was the Fortress of Solitude set, with Christopher Reeve flying down the middle of the stage with all the smoke and the dry ice.
""And from that day on, I thought, 'This is what I want to do', and 46 years later, I'm still doing it.""
We spoke to Corbould about the challenges of each of his very different Oscar-nominated projects.
""That was probably one of the most challenging movies only because Chris McQuarrie (the director) wants to do as much on camera as he can. We built full-size steam trains, bridges, railway track, a remote control train,"" Corbould explains.
""It's great for the special effects guys to work on those movies as they are so grounded in practical effects.""
And his favourite part?
""It's easy really, it's the train going off (the bridge), just because of the scale of it. The amount of preparation that went into it, the building of the train, the picking of the quarry. And we had one go at it and that's it. God forbid if it derailed before it got to the bridge! Once that train's moving... it was extremely hard to do. There's a lot of money at stake.""
Describing long-time collaborator and fellow Brit Ridley Scott as ""a genius"", Corbould says the 86-year-old, who directed Napoleon starring Joaquin Phoenix and Vanessa Kirby, ""works harder than anyone.""
""Because I've worked with him so much over the years, I have a sort of second sight into what he wants.
""The most challenging thing was the sheer pace and those big staged battles, like Waterloo - it was this massive field in churn and it was a kilometre and a half round to the other side, with the English army on one side and the French on the other.
""I really hope they do that extended version (director's cut).""
""Visually, it's stunning, it's like a work of art,"" Corbould says of Gareth Edwards' sci-fi action movie about a future war between humans and AI robots.
The film was made on a relatively low budget, quite the contrast to Mission Impossible and other blockbuster movies Corbould's worked on.
""We only sent two people out to Thailand (for filming) and a local special effects crew helped us out. We had one container and crammed as much stuff into it, smoke machines etc. I like a challenge!""
He adds: ""Gareth is such a talented director, you have to buy into his way of filmmaking.""
Corbould also praised films like Mission Impossible for being ""so grounded in practical effects"".
""In this day and age, you don't know how long that's going to go on for. These big grand scale movies, we've just got to keep making lots of money or they will die out.""
Having said that, he adds: ""They said to me 30 years ago that the practical effects were going to be a thing of the past with the new digital era. But today we're stronger than ever.""
He says that's ""down to the directors like Chris Nolan (whose film Oppenheimer has 13 Oscar nominations), Steven Spielberg and Ridley Scott because they're grounded in the practical area of it... not just special effects, but film celluloid. I think the two go together.""
So why is there such a healthy visual effects industry in the UK, with companies like Framestore, DNEG and of course, Neil Corbould SFX?
""We're a very tight community... being a small industry, on a small island, you have to be good,"" Corbould explains.
Speaking about the recent announcement in the Budget of various measures including an increase in tax relief for special effects costs, Corbould welcomed the news: ""It's a great step in the right direction.""
And there's no rest for the wicked with his next project already lined up.
""Looks like I'm going to be working with Gareth again on the new Jurassic film,"" he says.
A release date has already been set for July 2025.

2024-02-21T16:59:32.000Z,Stray Kids: How K-Pop took over the global charts in 2023,BBC News,"Inevitably enough, Taylor Swift was the biggest-selling artist in the world last year - but new figures from the recording industry suggest that Western artists have lost their grip on the charts.
Four of 2023's top 10 best-selling acts came from South Korea, with bands such as Stray Kids and Seventeen outselling stars like Drake and The Weeknd.
The international sales figures were compiled by the IFPI, which represents the global music industry. Bad Bunny and Lana Del Rey also made the top 10.
Although none of the South Korean bands in the list have broken the UK Top 40, they are responsible for millions of streams around the world, as K-Pop continues its phenomenal growth.
In the 12 years since Psy's Gangnam Style, the genre has continually expanded its reach - even making a notable impact on America's typically impenetrable music industry.
The charge was led by boyband phenomenon BTS, whose high-concept anthems (with references to Carl Jung and Herman Hesse) found them topping the charts worldwide, even before their swerve into English-language pop on hits like Butter and Dynamite.
In 2019, they became the first K-Pop band to headline Wembley Stadium. Within two years, they were performing at the Grammys and collaborating with Coldplay.
Their female counterparts, Blackpink, have achieved similar levels of success - last year headlining both the Coachella festival in California, and London's BST Hyde Park.
Their success can be chalked up bleeding-edge pop hits like Whistle, Ddu-du Ddu-du and Shut Down, the latter of which samples Paganini's second violin concerto.
But neither band featured in the IFPI's best-seller list: BTS are on hiatus while its members complete compulsory military service; while Blackpink spent the latter half of 2023 renegotiating their contracts with YG Entertainment - the media conglomerate that put the band together in 2016.
Entertainment companies like YG and Big Hit, which represents BTS, are the main engine of K-Pop's success, putting their acts through gruelling auditions and years of training before they're revealed to the public.
""If you were on an Olympic team you would have to be trained and we see no difference,"" Chris Lee, head of SM Entertainment told The Guardian in 2022.
""If they want to be the best in the world, it takes a lot of work. They get media training. They study languages so that they can communicate with many different audiences. We teach them how to have good personalities.""
Last year, Blackpink singer Rosé told James Corden how arduous the K-Pop regime could be.
""We wake up at like 9 to get ready, then we go at 11am and we practice all through 2am - we all come home at 2am, even on weekends,"" the 26-year-old said of the band's six-traineeship, during which the then-teenage members were separated from their families.
""We weren't really looking back to our homes or anything. We were just like, let's survive this.""
But the success of K-Pop is down to more than military-grade bootcamps.
Stray Kids, in particular, have won an ardent fanbase for their dark and experimental albums, which fuse elements of hip-hop, dubstep, heavy metal, electro-clash and jittery dance pop.
The eight piece - Felix, Changbin, Lee Know, Han, Seungmin, I.N, Bang Chan and Hyunjin - are unusual in that they write most of their own material. And they take pride in the fact that their songs often take major stylistic and temporal detours.
""The goal is to continuously pioneer new [musical] subjects and to have our music be recognized as a 'Stray Kids' genre,"" Changbin told Time Magazine., as it named the band one of its ""Next Generation Leaders"" last year.
The group scored two US number one albums in 2023, and ended the year as the third biggest-selling act on the planet, according to the IFPI, which represents the global music industry.
One place above them (and one below Swift) came the boyband Seventeen - which boasts a whopping 13 members, all of whom are also involved in the writing and production process.
When the group released their 11th EP, Seventeenth Heaven, last year it attracted 5.2 million pre-orders, making it the most pre-ordered K-pop album in history.
Other big sellers last year included Tomorrow X Together, a boyband put together by the team behind BTS; and NewJeans, a group of teenage girls, who fuse the old-skool R&B sounds of  TLC with playful, hooky melodies.
Unusually in the streaming era, these bands all generate huge CD sales - partly because they bundle discs with exclusive and collectible posters, stickers and lyric cards.
Many albums also come in multiple formats, with a different cover (and sometimes exclusive bonus tracks) dedicated to each specific member. Diehard fans try to collect them all.
That's not to suggest their success is purely down to marketing: NewJeans' breakout single SuperShy made multiple ""best of the year"" lists at the end of 2023, including those compiled by Rolling Stone, NME and Billboard Magazine.
And with BTS and Blackpink both expected to return with new music in 2024, K-Pop's global domination can only grow from here.

2024-03-02T02:18:27.000Z,Raye could break Brit Awards record for most awards in a single year,BBC News,"Singer-songwriter Raye could make Brit Awards history later if she becomes the most-awarded artist in a single year.
The star has already broken records by getting seven nominations, beating the six received in previous years by Craig David, Gorillaz and Robbie Williams.
And she has one award in the bag - songwriter of the year, which was announced ahead of Saturday's ceremony.
The 26-year-old will face competition in other categories from artists like Dua Lipa, Olivia Dean and J Hus.
A big year for British hip-hop is reflected in rapper Central Cee earning four nominations, with three nominations each for J Hus, Dave and Little Simz.
The event will be hosted by BBC Radio 1 DJ Clara Amfo, former Capital FM presenter Roman Kemp and TV personality Maya Jama.
Here is everything you need to know about the ceremony.
The singer is nominated for best artist, album, song (twice), new artist, pop act and R&B act.
Because of her double nomination in the best song category - for Prada and Escapism - she could scoop a maximum of six trophies on Saturday night.
But after she was named best songwriter - an award that wasn't part of the main nominations process and was announced separately on Wednesday - she could theoretically win seven 2024 Brit Awards in total.
The current record for the most Brits at a single ceremony is four, jointly held by Blur (1995), Adele (2016) and Harry Styles (2023).
Last year, there was criticism after all the nominees for the best artist prize were male.
So this year, the best artist shortlist has been extended from five to 10 artists, and includes six female artists.
Co-host Kemp told BBC News: ""In terms of music this year, the artists that have really just shone through are female artists.
""I think everyone who was nominated deserves to be there in their own right - it's not like they've said, 'Oh we need more female nominations, let's just put them in there.' It's genuinely who has provided some of the best work.
""Artists like Raye and Dua Lipa are the megastars right now.""
Another addition is a new award for the best R&B act, after many artists felt the genre was not celebrated enough.
It was previously represented in the best pop/R&B category, but that was dominated by more mainstream artists like Dua Lipa and Styles.
R&B acts who have had success in the past 24 months, instead of the usual 12, were eligible for nomination this year, so that artists who might have missed out in 2023 can be recognised.
Singers nominated in that category include Raye, Jorja Smith and Mahalia.
A host of artists will take to the stage at the ceremony, with Dua Lipa and Raye topping the bill.
Dance duo Jungle, Nigerian rapper Rema and Canadian pop sensation Tate McRae will also appear, while drum and bass veterans Chase & Status will be accompanied by two-time Brit winner Becky Hill.
Ellie Goulding and Calvin Harris will team up for a special performance, while Australian superstar Kylie Minogue is set to perform a medley of her hits after she is crowned this year's global icon.
Kylie follows in the footsteps of the likes of Taylor Swift and Sir Elton John after being announced as the recipient of the global icon award.
Raye has been named songwriter of the year, while Chase & Status have been named winners of producers of the year.
In December, it was announced that indie band The Last Dinner Party had won the Brits Rising Star prize.
The five-piece are one of the year's most talked-about new acts, thanks to their swooping, dramatic singles and theatrical stage costumes.
Singer Abigail Morris told the BBC it was ""a bit like having an out-of-body experience"".
The Brit Awards will be broadcast live by ITV1 and ITVX from 20:30 GMT on Saturday.
Outside the UK, viewers will be able to watch the ceremony on the Brit Awards YouTube channel.
The BBC News website will also have extensive coverage including live text updates from the red carpet and the ceremony itself from 17:00 GMT.

2024-02-21T10:52:12.000Z,Robin Windsor: Deborah Meaden pays tribute to Strictly Come Dancing star,BBC News,"Dragons' Den star Deborah Meaden has paid an emotional tribute to her former Strictly Come Dancing partner Robin Windsor.
Windsor, who died aged 44 earlier this week, competed with Meaden in the 2013 series of the BBC One dancing show.
In a tribute post on Instagram and X, Meaden described the news of Windsor's death as ""devastating"".
She said she was ""thinking of his family, friends and loved ones [who] will be aching at the loss"".
""Robin was a good man,"" she continued. ""He was kind and incredibly generous, supporting so many charities, helping so many people and giving so much of himself wherever he went.
""He lit up a room with his fun and energy and certainly his sparkle… he was never happier than when he was covered in crystals!
Meaden remembered him as ""talented, clever (a great partner for a quiz), and fun"".
Windsor and Meaden were the fourth couple to be eliminated in the 2013 series of Strictly and also took part in the show's live UK tour the following year.
Meaden recalled: ""He taught my mother to dance for her 80th birthday party and they whirled around the dance floor at her party… he knew how to make people feel good.
""He was also complex and human and open about the struggles of life after the limelight. I was lucky to have known you Robin, it's hard to know you are gone.""
During his time on Strictly Come Dancing, Windsor was also paired with Patsy Kensit and Anita Dobson, both of whom were eliminated eighth, and Lisa Riley, who made it to the semi-final.
The year after Windsor partnered with Meaden, he was forced to pull out of the dancing series due to a back injury.
But although he was not partnered with a celebrity, he did return to the show part way through the 2014 series and appeared in group dances with the other professionals.
He also continued to appear in the Strictly Christmas specials until 2015, when he competed with Alison Hammond.
After his death was announced, a huge number of Strictly stars past and present paid tribute to Windsor, including hosts Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman, judges Darcey Bussell, Craig Revel Horwood and Shirley Ballas, and pro dancers Oti Mabuse and Dianne Buswell.
Windsor's cause of death has not been confirmed. He had most recently been starring in Come What May, a Moulin Rouge tribute show.
The dancer was also an advocate for mental health and worked closely with the Sane Charity.

2024-02-27T12:41:45.000Z,More music leaving TikTok over Universal Music row,BBC News,"TikTok says it has started removing more music from its platform as part of a continuing row over royalties with Universal Music Group (UMG).
The app has already silenced songs by artists signed to the label, but is now having to do the same with writers too.
This means that videos featuring songs by artists such as Harry Styles and Adele, who have written with Universal-signed artists, could soon be muted.
TikTok says up to 30% of what it calls ""popular songs"" could be lost.
But some industry estimates say up to 80% of all music on TikTok could be muted.
That's because of something called ""split copyrights"". In other words, if a songwriter signed to Universal Music's publishing arm has contributed even a tiny part to a song, that entire recording will, in theory, have to come down.
That would include songs by artists on other labels, including the two remaining majors, Sony and Warner, and hundreds of independents.
Universal's music was licensed to TikTok until earlier this year - but they let the license lapse after failing to reach an agreement over how much the app should pay artists.
As a result, the label's recording catalogue, which is around three million songs, was removed at the start of February.
The publishing catalogue deal runs out at the end of the week, which means another four million songs are expected to be pulled from the platform.
Universal has accused TikTok of ""bullying"" them by wanting to pay a ""fraction"" of the rate other platforms do for their music.
UMG says that just 1% of their total revenue comes from the platform, which is owned by Chinese company ByteDance, despite having more than one billion users.
TikTok said Universal was presenting a ""false narrative and rhetoric"".
Music is a big part of the appeal of TikTok - content creators often add songs to their videos.
The app has also become a tool for artists to gain popularity and get their songs heard - there's even a TikTok Billboard top 50 chart in the US, which is calculated from user engagement.
Songs have been used to create viral moments like dance trends or challenges, popular musicians have embraced the platform to feel closer to fans and new artists have broken through to mainstream success as a result of it.
Mae Stephens, a 20-year-old from Kettering, quit her job at a supermarket and signed to a record label after her song If We Ever Broke Up went viral on TikTok.
She told the BBC, ""It's a bit of shock to be honest, I still can't believe everything that happened to me.""
The row over royalties has raised concerns that artists who found a fanbase on TikTok before signing to a major label will no longer be able to capitalise on their following.
Cody Fry, an artist signed to a record label owned by UMG, said in a TikTok video he felt ""like a person standing between two colliding planets"" - having seen reports about the licensing agreement expiring just as one of his tracks was going viral in China.
He told the BBC that he thought TikTok should ""value music more than it does currently"" and he wished the two companies could have resolved their differences without ""leaving it to the expense of artists on the ground"".
But pop star Kim Petras, whose music has been muted on the platform, says she supports Universal's position.
""I feel very protected by Universal,"" she told the BBC last week. ""I know people who have number one records and can't afford their rent, so I'm proud Universal is taking a stand.
""Of course, right now, all of us Universal artists are screwed a little bit, but you've gotta take one for the team. The intentions are noble.""

2024-02-26T13:00:04.000Z,Pattie Boyd reveals 'love triangle' letters from George Harrison and Eric Clapton,BBC News,"Model Pattie Boyd is selling letters that lift the lid on her notorious love triangle with guitarist Eric Clapton and Beatles star George Harrison.
Boyd was a muse to both men in the 1960s and 70s, inspiring Harrison's classic song Something and Clapton's hits Wonderful Tonight and Layla.
Initially married to the Beatle, she was pursued by his close friend Clapton in a series of passionate love letters.
Now she is auctioning notes from both men, along with other possessions.
The sale will take place at Christie's in London next month, with the items on public view from 15 to 21 March.
Boyd met the Beatles when she was cast in their 1964 film A Hard Day's Night and instantly felt a connection with Harrison, their famously ""quiet"" guitarist.
""He was quite shy, like me. I think that's why we got on,"" she said in an interview published on the website of auction house Christie's.
They dated for two years before marrying in January 1966, during which time the Beatles were often away on tour,
""George was so adorable when he was away,"" she said. ""He missed me, and I missed him terribly, and he would write amazing letters and wonderful postcards.""
One note in the auction sees Harrison write: ""Hope you're OK. I miss you. I'm starving - many grilled cheese sandwiches. Love you.""
Clapton was a frequent guest at the couple's house in Surrey but, unbeknown to Harrison, harboured feelings for Boyd.
In 1970, he sent her a letter in impeccably neat, angular longhand. ""I am writing this letter to you, with the main purpose of ascertaining your feelings towards a subject well known to both of us,"" it began.
""What I wish to ask you is if you still love your husband?"" he continued. ""All these questions are very impertinent, I know, but if there is still a feeling in your heart for me… you must let me know!""
""Don't telephone! Send a letter... That is much safer.""
Boyd initially thought the letter was from a fan, only realising the truth when Clapton phoned her later that day.
A second letter was written several months later, on a page Clapton had torn from a copy of John Steinbeck's novel Of Mice and Men.
""Dear Layla,"" Clapton began, using his nickname for Boyd. ""Why do you hesitate, am I a poor lover, am I ugly, am I too weak, too strong, do you know why?
""If you want me, take me, I am yours… if you don't want me, please break the spell that binds me. To cage a wild animal is a sin, to tame him is divine. My love is yours.""
He later wrote the rock standard Layla for Boyd.
""It was so beautiful and so magical,"" Boyd recalled. ""I was so flattered, but I was also so worried that George would work out why Eric had written this song.""
Boyd originally rebuffed Clapton's advances but, after her marriage faltered in the early 1970s, the musician invited Boyd to join him on tour.
Their romance flourished and they married in 1979 - with the blessing of Harrison, who took to calling Clapton his ""husband-in-law"".
Ultimately, however, Clapton's alcoholism and infidelity undermined the marriage, and they divorced in 1989.
Boyd, the daughter of a retired RAF bomber pilot, was a famous fashion model in the 1960s before turning her attention to photography.
She will sell her memorabilia including letters, paintings, photographs, jewellery and fashion next month.
Among the lots is a doodle by Harrison, in which he drew himself sitting beneath an apple tree, and a Christmas card he made for her in 1968.
""I've had them all for so many years - far too long,"" Boyd, who turns 80 this year, told The Telegraph. ""I thought, why don't I just sell everything and let everybody else enjoy it?""
The sale will be led by the the painting La jeune fille au bouquet by Emile Théodore Frandsen de Schomberg - which served as the cover for the 1970 album Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs by Clapton's band Derek and the Dominoes.
Clapton had originally bought the painting from the artist's son because the model's blonde hair and alluring almond eyes reminded him of Boyd. It is expected to sell for between £40,000 and £60,000.
Boyd told the Telegraph she sought Clapton's permission before selling the possessions.
""He asked if I was selling the Layla painting, and I said yes,"" she said. ""He said, 'Maybe there are other things you could sell as well.' So he's absolutely fine with me auctioning everything.""

2024-03-03T15:31:54.000Z,Eurovision 2024: Israel agrees to October Rain lyrics change,BBC News,"Israel's public broadcaster has requested changes to the lyrics of a song submitted for this year's Eurovision contest.
Organisers barred it last week for breaking rules on political neutrality.
Israeli broadcaster Kan had pledged not to alter the lyrics of October Rain - an apparent reference to the Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October.
But Israel's President Isaac Herzog called for ""necessary adjustments"" to ensure Israel can enter the show.
Israel has won the Eurovision Song Contest four times before. This year's event will be held in Sweden - who won last year's contest - in May.
Kan is in the process of choosing its entry, with October Rain the leading submission and Dance Forever in second place.
In a statement on Sunday, Kan said it had contacted the lyricists of both songs and asked them to ""readapt the texts, while preserving their artistic freedom"".
President Herzog, it added, had ""emphasised that it is precisely at a time when those who hate us are seeking to repress and boycott the State of Israel"" that the country ""must raise its voice"" in international forums.
Last month, when the European Broadcasting Union said it was assessing the lyrics, Kan said it had ""no intention to replace the song"".
Israel's entry, to be performed by 20-year-old singer Eden Golan, is due be confirmed next Sunday.
The original lyrics of October Rain - written in English - were published on Kan's website last month.
They include the lines ""They were all good children, every one of them"" and ""Who told you boys don't cry/ Hours and hours/ And flowers/ Life is not a game for the cowards.""
The reference to flowers was significant, according to Israel Hayom newspaper, as it often denotes war fatalities.
In previous years the EBU has forced national representatives to change their lyrics.
In 2009, Georgia withdrew from the event after its proposed entry - We Don't Wanna Put In - was rejected for its obvious references to the Russian president.
Separately, musicians from other Eurovision countries have called for Israel to be suspended over the war in Gaza.
These include artists in Iceland, Finland, Norway, Denmark and Sweden, with several pointing out that Russia has been disqualified since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine two years ago.
So far, Eurovision organisers have resisted those calls, arguing that the situations in Ukraine and Gaza are different.

2024-03-09T01:46:39.000Z,Barbie 2? Warner Bros boss says she would 'love' to make sequel,BBC News,"Warner Bros boss Pam Abdy has said the film studio would ""love"" to make Barbie 2, after director Greta Gerwig's movie ""ignited audiences around the world.""
The film took $1.4bn (£1.1bn) at the box office globally, making it the most successful movie of 2023.
Abdy, the co-chair and CEO of Warner Bros Motion Picture Group, said the film had ""smashed so many records"".
She added both parties were ""always talking"" about a follow-up, but that it would ultimately be Gerwig's decision.
Earlier this week, Gerwig said she is open to the idea, if she can find an ""undertow"" for the film.
With the Oscars on Sunday, Abdy said ""of course"" it hurt that Margot Robbie missed out on a nomination for best actress, and Gerwig for best director. She's a ""visionary"" and ""one of the best filmmakers working today"", Abdy said.
When it comes to Academy voters, Abdy told me: ""I don't want to say that they are sexist"".
But she does worry that not enough of them actually watched the movie.
The Academy has worked to diversify its 10,000-strong membership in recent years. But it's still a predominantly white, male organisation.
Abdy and I were talking at the Warner Bros. backlot in Burbank, Los Angeles - 110 acres of sound stages, painted facades and recognisable streets where some of cinema's best loved movies have been shot.
This studio celebrated its centenary last year and every inch of the lot feels familiar. We all really have seen it before.
The café in Casablanca where Humphrey Bogart's Rick and Ingrid Bergman's Ilsa kindled their Parisian romance sits around the corner from the stately courthouse used in Ben Affleck's Oscar-winning Argo.
My Fair Lady's Covent Garden was created in a nearby soundstage.
We pass a building adorned with a zigzag of metal fire escape steps where Tom Cruise was chased in Steven Spielberg's Minority Report.
Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling walked along these backlot streets in La La Land.
And Christopher Nolan filled a vast soundstage with water for Dunkirk.
The Oppenheimer director spent most of his career with Warner Bros, shooting the Dark Knight Trilogy, Inception, Dunkirk, Interstellar and other classics.
But in 2020 Nolan walked away, furious about the company's decision to put a year's worth of new movies onto its streaming platform.
Nolan then made his Bafta-winning and heavily tipped Oscar favourite about the theoretical physicist J Robert Oppenheimer with Universal, a bitter blow for the rival studio and one they seem to have learned from.
Abdy says she ""can't judge what they were doing"" - it was before her time - but thinks Warner Bros. was trying to adapt ""in the middle of a pandemic"". However, she accepts it lost one of its biggest stars and ""of course"" would like to woo Nolan back.
Pam Abdy began her career at Jersey Films, the company behind Pulp Fiction, first as a receptionist and then Danny DeVito's assistant. The director and actor picked her, she thinks, because he liked her strong New Jersey accent.
She drove DeVito to work each day and ""when he was off studying lines, I would go sneak around"" on the sets, hanging out ""to absorb every single thing I could and understand how each department worked and what they needed to do in a day"".
""I learned everything there, I really did,"" she says.
Abdy rose to become president and has since worked in many top roles including at Paramount Pictures, MGM and now Warner Bros. It makes her one of the most powerful women in Hollywood.
She and her co-chair Michael De Luca were hired by Warner Bros less than two years ago, with a mission to restore the studio to its past glories.
Warner Bros hasn't won a best picture Oscar since Argo in 2013.
The company is part of Warner Bros Discovery, owner of amongst other media titles CNN, the Discovery channel and HBO. The TV side of the business has been struggling with a sharp decline in advertising revenue.
The movie side has also had its own problems.
It didn't just squander the relationship with Nolan, it laid off staff and made some embarrassing, high profile decisions, including cancelling Batgirl, a movie which had reportedly cost $90m (£70m) to make.
The new regime has set about luring big names, the biggest so far being Tom Cruise who's formed a new partnership with Warner Bros.
Abdy wouldn't tell me what Cruise is making for her with director Alejandro González Iñárritu - it's still top secret - except to say it ""deserves to be seen on the biggest screens possible all around the world"".
She seems to be signalling that the studio has listened to Nolan.
He previously told me he makes his films for the big screen and that, when streaming happens too immediately, ""it's not good for the health of cinemas"".
Abdy agrees, although she doesn't think ""one size fits all"". She says they've made ""a shift"" when it comes to the window between when a movie is released in cinemas and when it appears on the streamers.
The studio is now telling filmmakers ""we all believe in the theatrical experience"" (American movie-speak for films shown on the big screen).
""You're in a room, it's dark, you're with an audience, you're laughing, you're crying, you're getting scared together, you're experiencing something together.""
Abdy has a good track record, including overseeing Oscar-winning films The Revenant, The Big Short and Birdman. Her tip to best picture glory is ""picking the best director"".
But according to a new UCLA Hollywood diversity report, only three female directors were at the helm of movies with budgets of $100m (£78m) or more, compared with 25 men. Directors of colour are slowly getting more opportunities on bigger projects, but women of colour continually get left out.
Abdy calls the slow progress for women in film ""frustrating"". She says it's all about educating younger people that they have ""an entry way"" into the business and believes that is happening.
But she also concedes: ""We have a lot of work to do.""
For now, she and De Luca are riding high on the commercial success of Barbie and have locked Margot Robbie and her production company LuckyChap in for future movies.
""We feel like their collision of art and commerce is just magical.""
And Abdy and De Luca have reintroduced one of the traditions devised by the company's co-founder Jack Warner who would present a key to the lot to his star talent - including Marilyn Monroe - to welcome them to the studio.
They recently presented Robbie with her own key. De Luca had found some of the originals for sale on eBay.
""Margot's is actually Marilyn Monroe's key.""
As she looks ahead to Sunday's Oscars ceremony, Abdy optimistically says there's ""always a chance"" that Barbie could win best picture.
The smart money is on Nolan's Oppenheimer. She says audiences have a relationship with Nolan's ""complex"" storytelling and they ""show up"" for his films - this one ""felt like an event"".
She believes the film industry had previously fallen into a rut - ""everything had to be a superhero movie"" - but says that isn't what people actually want.
If Barbie and Oppenheimer prove anything, it's that there are big audiences for different types of stories, if the filmmakers get them right.

2024-03-01T02:13:49.000Z,Olly Alexander: Can Dizzy put Eurovision 2024 in a spin?,BBC News,"For decades, Eurovision fans have wondered why the UK underplays its hand so badly.
We produce world-beating pop stars like Ed Sheeran and Dua Lipa - but our Eurovision entrants have largely been untested amateurs, singing songs so underwhelming they might has well have walked on stage with a white flag.
The tide turned in 2022, when Sam Ryder brought the Bowie-inspired Space Man to Turin, blowing away cobwebs (and more than a few loudspeakers) with the Taurean force of his live vocals.
He duly claimed second place - the UK's best result since 1998.
Buoyed by that success, the UK sent rising pop star Mae Muller to last year's contest.
Her song, the archly titled I Wrote A Song, was a bubbly pop anthem that won approval from fans - but lacklustre staging and a problematic vocal performance torpedoed her chances.
The UK ended the night in 25th place, out of 26.
So what next? The BBC could have admitted defeat and returned to the ranks of reality show runners-up, or they could have doubled down.
They chose the latter.
Enter Olly Alexander - the former frontman of chart-topping pop group Years & Years, and a Bafta-nominated actor, who's been obsessed with Eurovision his whole life.
""It goes right back to being a kid and watching the show with my family - ordering pizza and spending all night in front of the TV watching this insane, amazing show,"" he told BBC News last year.
""It's a bit like a spiritual homecoming for me because I love Eurovision so much.""
His participation was revealed on the grand final of Strictly Come Dancing last December - another sign of how seriously the BBC is taking the contest this year.
Three months later, he's finally revealed the song he'll be performing. A pulsing electro anthem called Dizzy, it dropped on streaming services at midnight, ahead of its radio premiere on Zoe Ball's Breakfast show on Friday morning.
""It's funny, I've never had a song with this much anticipation,"" he told Graham Norton, in an interview that will be screened on BBC One at 10:40pm on Friday.
So will it make you giddy with excitement, or simply leave you nauseous?
The first impressions are good. This is a sleek, streamlined slice of modern pop (imagine the Pet Shop Boys on a trip to the disco) anchored by a descending chord progression that'll be instantly recognisable to anyone who's heard Gloria Gaynor's I Will Survive or Miley Cyrus's Flowers.
Unlike those songs, which are all about emerging from a break-up, this is more about falling head-over-heels, whisk-me-off-my-feet-and-kiss-me-on-the-mouth in love.
""Won't you take my hand and spin me / Round and round so the moment never ends.""
The verses, meanwhile, are (intentionally?) written in the mangled English that characterises Eurovision's best songs. ""Beautiful garden / Eternal flowers,"" sings Alexander, apparently quoting directly from the Interflora website.
Crucially, however, the hook is instantly memorable - a huge advantage in a competition where you only have one chance to make an impression.
If there's a criticism, it's that the song could go harder. Instead of building to a climax, that final chorus is too polite. Without wanting to trivialise things, the song is desperately in need of a donk.
9 Iconic Eurovision Moments
Dizzy for Eurovision? Here's a look back at must-see moments: legendary wins, scandals, controversy & more.

But that can all be tweaked for the performance. There's no rule that says the live version has to sound like the radio edit; and a few well-timed pyrotechnics could easily bring the house down (not literally, one hopes).
As always, the staging is crucial, and that's one area where Alexander excels.
His 2021 Brits performance of It's A Sin, striding across Sir Elton John's piano, was one of the ceremony's most memorable performances in years. A blissed-out, intricately-choreographed Glastonbury set the following year proved he has the ability to command a huge audience.
The other variable is his competition.
After Loreen's victory for Sweden last year, several countries have entered up-tempo bops - from the techno bounce of Lithuania's Silvester Belt to the percolating synthpop of Spain's Nebulossa.
Others have drawn inspiration from 2023's runner-up, Kaarija, with Ireland's Bambi Thug and Croatia's Baby Lasagna putting forward gloriously chaotic songs that test the very boundaries of pop music.
In other words, the UK needs to work hard to distinguish itself.
Personally, though, I can't see Dizzy tripping up too badly. Alexander is a beloved performer with name recognition across Europe, and the song capitalises on his cheeky charisma.
It might not attract ""douze points"" across the board, but it would be hard to relegate to last place.
All eyes will be watching when Alexander twirls into Malmö this May.

2024-03-10T02:55:42.000Z,How to watch the Oscars and who is nominated,BBC News,"The biggest night in the entertainment calendar is finally upon us - the 96th Oscars.
Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer, which has 13 nominations, is expected to sweep up at the ceremony later.
Many film fans will also be cheering on Barbie, last year's biggest hit at the box office, which has eight nods.
US television host Jimmy Kimmel will be presenting the awards from Los Angeles, with the show starting at 16:00 (PT), 19:00 (ET) and 23:00 (GMT).
Here are all the hot talking points and things to look out for at the ceremony  (we've already placed a bet on Margot Robbie wearing pink).
More formally known as the Academy Awards, the Oscars have been recognising big screen talent since 1929.
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, based in Los Angeles, annually nominate and vote across more than 20 categories including best picture, best actor and best actress.
While film awards ceremonies including the Golden Globes and the Baftas attract plenty of attention, the Oscars is the pinnacle of achievement in the awards season calendar. The awards are voted for by Academy members.
Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer, about the life of the man who helped develop the atomic bomb, is leading the charge with 13 nominations including best picture, best actor (Cillian Murphy) and best supporting actress (Emily Blunt).
Titanic, Ben Hur and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King jointly hold the record for the most wins with 11, so could Oppenheimer match it or even do better?
Its British-born filmmaker Nolan is the hot favourite to pick up best director. While his films have collected Oscars previously, the man behind movies including Interstellar, Inception and The Dark Knight Rises has never won this prestigious category.
In fact, despite his pedigree, he's only been nominated for best director once previously (Dunkirk in 2018). This is surely his year.
Four out of five nominated directors this year are European (Nolan has dual US/British citizenship but he was born and grew up here so we're claiming him).
If, as widely expected, Oppenheimer's Robert Downey Jr picks up the award for best supporting actor, it will also be a first Oscar win for him.
Chasing down Oppenheimer with 11 nods is Yorgos Lanthimos's brilliantly bizarre Poor Things. Its star, Emma Stone, is a frontrunner in the best actress race alongside Lily Gladstone from Martin Scorsese's Killers of the Flower Moon. If Gladstone triumphs - and it's hard to call at this point - she will be the first Native American to win the award.
Killers of the Flower Moon, about the murder of members of the Osage Indian tribe by white settlers who are after their oil, scored 10 nominations in total.
Scorsese has now been nominated for a best director Oscar 10 times, which makes him the most nominated living director in Academy Awards history. He's also the oldest best director nominee at 81.
His long-time collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker is the most nominated editor in history with nine nods, and this could be a record-breaking fourth win for her (she currently holds the joint record with three wins).
Unless you've been hiding under a rock since Christmas (and we've all felt like doing it in this weather), Barbie director Greta Gerwig and the film's star, Margot Robbie, missed out on individual nominations when they were announced in January.
Barbie did land eight nods in total though, with America Ferrera and Ryan Gosling recognised in the best supporting actress and supporting actor categories respectively. But it's still not Kenough for some.
All the films above are up for the coveted best picture prize, and are joined by French courtroom drama Anatomy of a Fall, romantic drama Past Lives, Leonard Bernstein biopic Maestro, incisive satire American Fiction, warm comedy tale The Holdovers and chilling Nazi drama The Zone of Interest.
The Barbenheimer juggernaut that sparked a thousand memes has done the Oscars no harm this year; the commercial success of these two films which have put bums on seats and also won over the critics, may bring new audiences to this year's event.
While some categories appear to have it all wrapped up - The Holdovers' Da'Vine Joy Randolph and Oppenheimer's Robert Downey Jr have picked up pretty much every film prize going in the run-up to the Oscars - there could still be some surprises in store.
The race for best actress between Stone and Gladstone is too close to call, but could Gladstone's recent Screen Actors Guild (SAG) win get her over the line? That's what happened with Michelle Yeoh last year.
However, Stone has the showier role as Poor Things' charming protagonist Bella Baxter, while Gladstone's dignified and resilient Molly Kyle in Flower Moon is a more understated part that enjoys considerably less screen time. It's an intriguing contest.
Best actor is also up in the air with Paul Giamatti (The Holdovers) and Cillian Murphy (Oppenheimer) in a two-horse race, although Murphy seems to have his nose in front following recent wins at Bafta and SAG. If he wins, he will be the first Irish-born actor to triumph, although Daniel Day-Lewis, who holds both British and Irish citizenship, has won three best actor Oscars previously.
In best picture, could The Holdovers pull an Argo, winning best picture for a film in which the director (Alexander Payne) isn't nominated for best director? It will take some doing to overhaul the Oppenheimer steamroller, but stranger things have happened.
Slightly in the realms of fantasy now, but if Rustin's Colman Domingo also pulls off a big shock by winning the Oscar for best actor for playing gay Civil Rights activist Bayard Rustin, he will be the first Afro-Latino actor to win the prize. And there are people of colour in every acting category.
Jodie Foster was nominated for best supporting actress for her portrayal of the gay swimming coach Bonnie Stoll in Nyad. It's the first time two gay actors have been nominated for playing two gay characters in the same year.
There's progress elsewhere, too. But it's slow progress. Anatomy of a Fall's Justine Triet is only the eighth woman to be nominated for best director (the Oscars director branch is made of up 75% men). However a record three films directed by women - Triet, Gerwig and Celine Song (Past Lives) - are up for best picture (out of a possible 10).
Other categories are also worth paying attention to - the short film and short animation categories are buckling under the strain of stardust this year.
Both shortlists are worth checking out in their own right but some names you might recognise include Wes Anderson, who has directed The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar, a Roald Dahl adaptation starring Benedict Cumberbatch, Ralph Fiennes and Dev Patel.
Meanwhile, David Olewoyo stars in Misan Harriman's The After, which tackles grief.
And Robbie Robertson could pick up a posthumous Oscar for best score for Killers of the Flower Moon. He sadly died aged 80 in August last year.
Dave Mullins, who worked at Pixar for 20 years, wrote and directed animated short War is Over! Inspired by the Music of John & Yoko. The famous pair's son, Sean Lennon, is the executive producer.
Anyone who is anyone will be there, is the short answer. Most of the nominees will be gracing the red carpet (we think it's red anyway, last year they switched to a champagne colour but it got dirty very quickly).
Presenters include Zendaya, Al Pacino, Lupita Nyong'o, Bad Bunny, Dwayne Johson, Regina King, Matthew McConaughey, Mahershala Ali, Ke Huy Quan, Brendan Fraser and Michelle Pfeiffer.
Never mind the A-listers, we're hoping Messi, the dog from Anatomy of a Fall, makes another star appearance.
The best song nominees will all perform, including Barbie's Ryan Gosling and Mark Ronson with I'm Just Ken. Gosling gave a hilarious reaction to the song's win at the Critics' Choice Awards earlier this year - bemused and almost suspicious.
Billie Eilish will also sing her Barbie track, the favourite to win, What Was I Made For?
US late night presenter Jimmy Kimmel returns to hosting duties this year - it will be his fourth time, including his stint at the helm last year, which marked a smooth return after the chaos of 2022's ceremony when Will Smith slapped one of the awards presenters, Chris Rock.
Kimmel joked when his return was announced: ""I always dreamed of hosting the Oscars exactly four times."" We bet it's not his last, though.
The 2024 Oscars will air live on Sunday 10 March from the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, where the ceremony has been held since 2002.
The show can be watched in the US on ABC and on various streaming services. It's also broadcast around the world in more than 200 territories.
In the UK, you might actually be able to stay awake to watch this year. The awards start an hour earlier and the clocks in Los Angeles - PST - go forward an hour on Oscars Sunday. The show starts at 16:00 (PT), 19:00 (ET) and midnight (GMT). UK viewers can watch on ITV and ITVX from 22:30.
As well as Nolan, other Brits in the running include Emily Blunt (Oppenheimer), Carey Mulligan (Maestro), Jonathan Glazer (director, The Zone of Interest), Jacqueline Durran (costume design, Barbie) and Holly Waddington (costume design, Poor Things).
And what about this for an effort? Special effects whizz Neil Corbould (who already has two Oscars under his belt) is up for three this year in the visual effects category for The Creator, Napoleon and Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One.
Meanwhile, if Sandra Huller picks up best actress (Anatomy of a Fall) she will be the first German to do so in 60 years.
It's also the first time two international films not in the English language have been nominated for best picture in the same year (Anatomy of a Fall and The Zone of Interest).

The hit musical Sunset Boulevard scooped 11 nods, including Scherzinger for best actress in a musical and Tom Francis for best actor in a musical.
And Dear England, James Graham's play about Gareth Southgate, has nine, with Joseph Fiennes receiving his first.
The Oliviers is seen as the most prestigious awards event in UK theatre.
Sunset Boulevard, a new production of Andrew Lloyd Webber's story of a fading film star, also received nominations in all the acting categories for a musical, as well as best musical revival, and best director for Jamie Lloyd.
The National Theatre garnered the most nominations for a single company, with its productions Dear England, Hadestown, The Motive and the Cue, Till the Stars Come Down and The Effect all recognised across a number of categories.
Footballing drama Dear England is the most nominated play, with nods including Fiennes for best actor, Gina McKee for best actress in a supporting role, Rupert Goold for best director and best new play.
Many television, film and music stars have received recognition, including James Norton for A Little Life and Parker, who scored her first Olivier nomination, for Plaza Suite.
The Sex and the City star is appearing opposite her husband Matthew Broderick in Neil Simon's 1968 play, with critics praising her performance as ""a revelation"".
A number of one-person plays received nominations in the best actor and actress categories - include Snook's first, for The Picture of Dorian Gray, Andrew Scott for Vanya and Sheridan Smith for Shirley Valentine.
The Picture of Dorian Gray, based on Oscar Wilde's 1890 novel, is running in London's West End until May.
Snook, who starred in Succession, plays 26 characters in the play and is surrounded by a camera crew so her performance can be beamed onto overhead screens.
""I'm pretty stoked, yeah, just a bit overwhelmed,"" the Adelaide-born actress told the BBC upon learning of her nomination.
""Australia's asleep so I haven't called my parents yet to tell them. I'm excited when they wake up to give them a call.""
David Tennant also scored a best actor nomination for his portrayal of Macbeth at the Donmar Warehouse.
Others who made the shortlist include Haydn Gwynne, posthumously nominated for best actress in a supporting role for When Winston Went to War with the Wireless.
And, in an unusual twist, one performer is still in the dark about their Olivier nomination.
Marisha Wallace is up for best actress in a musical for her portrayal of nightclub singer Adelaide in Guys And Dolls; but she went straight from the West End to the Celebrity Big Brother house, alongside the likes of Sharon Osbourne and Fern Britton.
The reality show's producers confirmed on Tuesday that she won't be told about her nomination ""until she leaves the house"".
The best new musical nominees are The Little Big Things, Next to Normal, Operation Mincemeat and A Strange Loop.
The best musical revival category also has a number of strong favourites, including Groundhog Day, Guys & Dolls, Hadestown and Sunset Boulevard.
The annual awards ceremony takes place on 14 April at the Royal Albert Hall, hosted by Hannah Waddingham.

2024-03-07T13:07:23.000Z,Michael Sheen in his element as NHS founder Nye Bevan say theatre critics,BBC News,"Michael Sheen has been praised by critics for his performance as Nye Bevan, in a National Theatre production. Nye tells the story of the left-wing politician who was credited with being the founder of the modern day National Health Service.
The FT's four-star review said Sheen delivered an ""electrifying performance driven by a fantastic ensemble"".
It also praised the staging, noting the ""canny set design of sliding hospital curtains to send scenes tumbling over one another as they do in dream"".
However Sarah Hemming added that we ""don't get enough of an up-close study of Bevan the man, or when the Labour party heaved the welfare state into being"".
The Guardian's Arifa Akbar agreed  and wrote that the pacing of the script was off, and ""the momentous invention of the NHS is tackled, as if in summary, in the last half hour"".
She added that the ""narrative is too long-reaching and schematic"" and the well researched material is ""not fully absorbed dramatically"".
But she complemented the Welsh actor who ""brings a furious fey playfulness and vulnerability"" to his character.
The co-production between the National Theatre and the Wales Millennium Centre, tells the story of Nye Bevan in a series of flashbacks as a morphine-induced Bevan lies in a hospital bed battling terminal stomach cancer in 1960.
Through hallucinations we see everything from Nye being bulled by his teacher as a young boy for his stammer, to his beginnings in local council politics, all the way to his lone vocal opposition against Churchill during the war.
The Telegraph's four-star review said Sheen ""is in his element here too - by turns down to earth and messianic, tender and full of clenched tenacity"" and that ""the death-bed climax is rousingly poignant"".
Dominic Cavendish also praised the rest of the cast ""with fine work especially from Sharon Small, as his self-sacrificing wife Jennie Lee"" who was also an MP for a number of years.
Clive Davis of the The Times also praised Small but commented ""it's a shame we don't see more of her"".
A new play entitled Jennie Lee will be touring the UK from April and will chart the Scottish politician's life as Westminster's youngest MP.
Aneurin Bevan was born in Tredegar, Wales in 1897 into a large mining family and left school at 13 to work in the mine.
By 19 he was active in trade unionism and was head of his local miners' lodge, becoming a well-known orator and social commentator.
He became a councillor on Monmouth County Council in 1928, then a member of parliament for Ebbw Vale in 1929. His maiden speech was an attack on Winston Churchill, who he saw as the main enemy of the miners.
Bevan married a fellow left-wing Labour MP, Jennie Lee, in 1934. They had no children.
In 1945 the Labour Party won the general election. As Minister for Health and Housing, Bevan created the National Health Service on 5 July 1948.
In 1955 he ran for the leadership of the party but was defeated by Hugh Gaitskill.
In 1959 he was elected deputy leader of the Labour Party, but died in 1960 of cancer.
Some critics were overall less positive of the production, with the Independent's three-star review calling the premise a ""tired theatrical set-up, to have an ageing famous figure reliving his life in convenient vignettes"".Despite the ""saggy texts"", Alice Saville wrote that director Rufus Norris manages to ""keeps things nimble and strange"".
The Evening Standard's review criticised the script by Tim Price, and said it was ""lumpy and obvious"".
""The comparisons Price draws between self-serving, right-wing politicians then and now feel heavy-handed,"" he added.
Nonetheless, Nick Curtis noted that Sheen's ""charisma, along with goodwill toward the NHS, gets Rufus Norris's playfully earnest co-production over the line"".

2024-03-07T19:21:16.000Z,Eurovision 2024: Israel allowed to compete after lyric change,BBC News,"Israel will be allowed to compete at the Eurovision Song Contest 2024 after changing the lyrics to its song, organisers have confirmed.
Eden Golan will represent the country at the contest in Sweden this May.
Her original song, October Rain, was thought to reference the Hamas attacks of 7 October and had been barred for breaking rules on political neutrality.
Israel's public broadcaster agreed to amend the song, now titled Hurricane, and will unveil it this weekend.
In a statement, The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) - which organises the contest - said earlier: ""The EBU can confirm that the official submission from its Israeli Member Kan has been deemed eligible to compete in the Eurovision Song Contest in May.
""The Contest's Reference Group, its governing board, made the decision to accept the song 'Hurricane' for the upcoming competition after careful scrutiny of the lyrics.
""It was agreed that 'Hurricane' met the necessary criteria for participation in accordance with the rules of the competition.""
Israeli broadcaster Kan had previously pledged not to alter the lyrics, but the country's President Isaac Herzog later called for ""necessary adjustments"" to ensure Israel can take part in the contest.
The original lyrics of October Rain - written in English - were published on Kan's website last month.
They included the lines ""They were all good children, every one of them"" and ""Who told you boys don't cry/ Hours and hours/ And flowers/ Life is not a game for the cowards.""
On Wednesday, Belgium's French-speaking Culture Minister Benedicte Linard called for Israel to be banned from Eurovision as long as the war in Gaza continues.
""Just like Russia has been excluded from competitions and Eurovision following its invasion of Ukraine, Israel should be excluded until it puts an end to its flagrant violations of international law, which are causing thousands of victims, especially children,"" she wrote on X.
Israel insists that its ground offensive against Hamas in Gaza is being carried out in line with international law. Its military has repeatedly said that it goes out of its way to try to avoid harming civilians.
Ms Linard also told parliament on Wednesday that she would ask public broadcaster RTBF, which is organising Belgium's entry to Eurovision, to voice the concerns to the EBU.
Her Flemish counterpart, Benjamin Dalle, said an Israeli suspension would be appropriate while so many Palestinian civilians were suffering, according to a report by Flemish broadcaster VRT.
Musicians in several countries have called for Israel to be suspended from the contest.
In December,  Iceland's Association of Composers and Lyricists published a statement saying Israel's military action in Gaza made its participation incompatible with an event ""characterised by joy and optimism"".
In Finland, a petition signed by more than 1,400 music industry professionals accused their national broadcaster Yle of double standards, saying it was among the first to demand the ban on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
The EBU soon after banned Russia from participating.
Before he was selected to represent the UK, Olly Alexander also endorsed a statement accusing Israel of genocide.
An Israeli official later told the UK's Daily Telegraph newspaper the arguments were ""absurd"" and accused Alexander and his fellow signatories of ""anti-Israel bias"".
Israel has won the Eurovision Song Contest four times before.
Its military launched an air and ground campaign in Gaza after Hamas's attacks on Israel on 7 October, in which around 1,200 people were killed and 253 others were taken hostage.
More than 30,800 people have been killed in Gaza since then, the territory's Hamas-run health ministry says.

His play Saved, set on a south London council estate, sparked controversy for its portrayals of violence, which initially saw it banned when first staged in 1965.
Actor Samuel West described him as ""a theatrical giant"" in a post on X.
""His work was like nobody else's: passionate, serious, principled, anguished, strange, completely original,"" added West, who performed in Sam Mendes' 1991 production of The Sea at the National Theatre.
Bond was born in north London in 1934 and taught himself to read from his mother's shopping catalogues, before quitting school at 15.
He said his lifelong love affair with theatre stemmed in part from seeing his sister being sawn in half as a conjuror's assistant at a local music hall.
Novelty aside, experiences of wartime society informed his peacetime works of societal and community tensions in a changing world.
Bond's incendiary approach, which ultimately saw him fall out with collaborators and cast members, initially helped him make an instant impact as part of the Royal Court theatre's writers' group.
His first full play, goadingly titled The Pope's Wedding, opened in 1962 and explored the banality of rural life and growing isolation.
But it was Saved, three years later, that really set his reputation and public reaction alight. Its depictions of mindless, frustration-filled urban violence, including a baby being stoned to death in a pram, caused outrage.
Looking back on the furore when speaking to the BBC in 2010, Bond said: ""When it was produced... the scandal and shock and the horror... people were fighting in the theatre... the abuse in the papers. I used to get letters written in blood and excreta. I was regarded as some sort of moral hyena.""
Defences from Sir Laurence Olivier and other theatre icons failed to stop it being censored by Lord Chamberlain, who refused to licence the play.
Paradoxically, this banishment saw the work become a sensation outside the UK, establishing Bond as a ""colossus of the world stage"", wrote Claire Armitstead for The Guardian.
The Royal Court, perhaps spurred by the international interest, pushed forward unapologetically in putting on Bond's next play - the surrealist Early Morning.
This escalated shock value further - portraying Queen Victoria as killing Prince Albert and raping Florence Nightingale, as well as delivering conjoined twins. Heaven turns out to be a world of cannibalism.
Despite its satirical edge, the rewriting of Victorian monarchy once again incurred the wrath of censors. Showings did unofficially go ahead, however, billed as dress rehearsals.
Bond's two censored plays, banned so close in time, worked to force a rethink. Taken together, they are credited with playing a pivotal role in the abolition of theatre censorship by 1968.
""It is hard to imagine the explosion of visceral drama in the 1990s - especially the work of Sarah Kane - without his example,"" said Dominic Cavendish in his obituary for the the Telegraph.
But although these early plays contained a ""high quotient of violence"", he was neither a ""sensation-seeker nor a despairing nihilist"", wrote theatre critic Michael Billington in the Guardian.
Social themes were evident in his Shakespearean works, including 1971's Lear - a modern rewriting of King Lear.
In Bingo, he turned his focus upon the Bard himself, casting Patrick Stewart in the lead role.
""Bond's Shakespeare was an unforgettable portrait of the artist as an old man, confronting his ineffectualness in mitigating the world's cruelty"", added Billington.
When Billington asked if he saw this reflecting his own work, Bond replied: ""All I can do is write the best plays I can and keep describing reality as I see it.""
This honesty continued to be his greatest artistic weapon, but arguably also his sharpest career vice.
Arguments with institutions, including the Royal Shakespeare Company, saw him walk out over the standard of rehearsals for the 1985 imagining of The War Plays.
""The men who run the National and the RSC - I call them the floating dead,"" he raged.
The Royal Court's artistic director, Max Stafford-Clark, would also call him ""the most difficult person I have worked with"" in a very public spat.
Whatever his personal faults, the fiery stage genius remains undeniable.
Alongside his stage work, Bond also worked on a number of screenplays, including Blow Up, Laughter In The Dark and Walkabout.

2024-02-24T00:11:52.000Z,Gareth Edwards: The Creator director on shaking up Hollywood's visual effects,BBC News,"Hollywood director Gareth Edwards has always done things differently. Now his latest film has all the tech heads in Tinseltown talking.
Best known for blockbusters such as Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016) and Godzilla (2014), and now rumoured to be helming the next Jurassic Park movie, his sci-fi action film The Creator is in the running for best special effects and best sound at the Oscars next month.
The film sees John David Washington play Joshua, an ex-special forces agent, as a future war rages between humans and artificial intelligence (AI). The movie also stars Gemma Chan and Alison Janney.
Speaking to BBC Click's Spencer Kelly, Edwards says: ""I used to jokingly refer to the style of the film [as] if Terrence Malik had sex with James Cameron and had a baby... that was the ultimate high benchmark of what this film was trying to do!""
Its impressive visuals - check out that huge military spaceship called The Nomad - have been widely praised, especially given the film had a budget of around $80m (£63m), a third of what a special effects-heavy movie like this would usually cost.
Working with pioneering studio Industrial Light and Magic (ILM), which was founded in 1975 in order to create the visual effects for Star Wars, British-born Edwards took inspiration from his first film Monsters (2010), an indy made on a tiny budget with a small team.
Most big films meticulously plan and build elaborate sets before shooting the majority of their special effects against a blue/green screen, which is hugely expensive.
But Edwards switched things up, shooting on location in countries including Cambodia and Thailand, then adding the special effects later.
Referencing Monsters, which had a crew of just six and also shot on location, Edwards says: ""[I was] trying to get back to the positives of doing a guerrilla film.
""It's a way more efficient, exciting and interesting process. If you go to a location that's like the place in the scene and... if the crew is small enough, it's cheaper to fly anywhere in the world than it is to build a set.
""Whatever was the best place in the world we could find for that scene, we would go and shoot it there, knowing that in the computer afterwards, we can change things.
""And [it] already looks good before you hand it over to the visual effects company.""
Working that way has been made easier with recent advances in technology, Edwards explains.
""We tried to keep everything small and what allowed for that, which couldn't have happened five years ago, was that the camera technology had become really good.""
A Sony FX3 camera was the tool of choice: ""It's very cheap and small, I could just move with the camera. It was a massive, liberating thing.""
The careful choice of locations also helped keep the budget down.
""It looks bigger than your average film because every location is an Instagram destination,"" Edwards tells Kelly.
A significant chunk of The Creator was filmed in Thailand because ""money goes a lot further there"".
But creating a film in this way requires a lot of trust on behalf of the visual effects company, who come in at the tail-end of the project.
Edwards explains that he showed the early stages of the scenes to ILM so any misunderstandings could be ironed out quickly.
Shooting on location was also an advantage for the cast.
Londoner Andrew Roberts was the on-set special effects supervisor for the film.
""It's great to have something real for the visual effects artists to build on top of, and also for the actors to be in a space where there is something real that can inform their emotion and their performances, rather than being surrounded by blue or green [screen] and being told to imagine.""
The film has received much praise for its special effects, although some critics have not been quite as impressed with the storytelling itself.
The Guardian's Wendy Ide awarded it four stars, writing: ""British director Gareth Edwards finally gets to make the sci-fi spectacular he was always destined to tackle.
""And with this ambitious, ideas-driven, expectation-subverting, man-versus-machines showdown, he has co-written and directed one of the finest original science fiction films of recent years.""
But the Evening Standard's Hannah Strong had reservations, awarding it just two stars: ""It's a handsome film and demonstrates the filmmakers' vivid imagination, but this doesn't quite extend to the story itself, or its dialogue which often veers into cheesy territory.""
For Edwards, the film posed a different challenge to the likes of Rogue One, his last movie which came out eight years ago.
Reports claimed that Lucasfilm left Edwards out in the cold towards the end of the project, bringing in Tony Gilroy to write new dialogue and shoot extra scenes.
Edwards has disputed this, however, telling KRCW's The Business podcast that when Gilroy was brought in, they both worked together until the very end of the movie.
""Having done these massive franchises, there's pros and cons,"" Edwards tells BBC Click.
""The cons are you have this giant fanbase and all this pressure and you cannot fail; it had better be a massive hit because there's so many people waiting to see it.
""When you do an original science fiction [film], you've got the opposite problem - no-one's heard of it, no-one cares, you've got to educate the world about what it's about... why they should go and see it.
""It's a double-edged sword. [You're] trying to do something new but if it's too out there... I just made this stuff up in my head and everyone is helping me create it but what if I'm wrong and it doesn't work?""
Perhaps surprisingly given his pedigree, Edwards, who hails from Nuneaton, is his own worst critic.
""I always think I'm not pushing things enough, I always think I've conformed and sold out... I always look at my heroes and beat myself up. My heroes growing up were Spielberg, Lucas, James Cameron.
""We could go a lot further and do something more unique..."" he trails off.
""[But] the day you get through a film, and everything about it was easy and fun and enjoyable, is the day you made your worst movie and you should probably retire.""
And on The Creator's Oscar chances?
He modestly points out that he's not personally nominated as the recognition is for the visual effects team (Roberts, Jay Cooper, Ian Comley and Neil Corbould) and the sound crew.
""As a proud parent of the film, it's a nice end to the journey,"" he concedes.
Roberts adds: ""I was born and grew up in the UK, my parents are from the Caribbean, a working class family and... to be at this point of being an Oscar nominee and potentially getting to win... I never could have dreamed this.""
BBC Click's interviews with Gareth Edwards and Andrew Roberts will feature in the latest episode of the programme, which airs on the BBC News Channel at 0030 on Saturday 24 February.

2024-03-11T05:01:03.000Z,Cillian Murphy: Oscar win makes Oppenheimer star a Hollywood heavyweight,BBC News,"After making his name battling zombies in 28 Days Later and ruling a ruthless gang in Peaky Blinders, Cillian Murphy has now been recognised as a Hollywood heavyweight after winning his first Oscar for playing the father of the atomic bomb in Oppenheimer.
As an actor with a serious reputation and a serious talent, it was refreshing that the first thing to come out of Murphy's mouth when he went on stage to accept his best actor statuette was a joyful laugh.
Not someone usually given to public displays of emotion, it was clear how much winning an Oscar meant.
He may have been the frontrunner to win throughout awards season, but he was still ""a little overwhelmed"" to have the Oscar in his hand, he told the audience.
Declaring himself ""a very proud Irishman"" - the first Irish-born star to win best actor at the Oscars, in fact - he did then get serious.
Clearly conscious of his winning role as J Robert Oppenheimer, the US theoretical physicist whose work gave humanity the potential for nuclear annihilation, he dedicated the award to ""the peacemakers everywhere"".
As ITV's Oscars night host Jonathan Ross said, it was ""nice for him to use that moment to point out that we are living in a world which is forever changed by what that film's about"".
Ross added: ""That's one of the problems I had with the film, that it sort of lionised that man without really forcing the audience to look at what he'd done, even though he was going through that anguish.""
Although the early part of the film focuses on the creation and development of the atomic bomb, the last hour sees Oppenheimer grappling with what he's done, as he comes to terms with the many lives lost as a result of his work.
""This is actually a very human story,"" Murphy told BBC culture editor Katie Razzall last month.
""And if you think about the sort of dilemmas they were wrestling with at the time, they are the biggest, most profound, most paradoxical, most important kind of moral dilemmas that we're still wrestling with as a race and as the world.""
Born in the suburbs of Cork in 1976, Murphy's interest in acting developed in secondary school after he took part in a drama module.
But he actually pursued music as a career first - Murphy played guitar alongside his brother Páidi in a string of rock bands in his late teens and early 20s.
He also studied law at University College Cork, but failed his first year exams because his heart had increasingly become set on acting. His professional debut came with a theatre performance in 1996.
Film roles followed in Danny Boyle's horror film 28 Days Later, Ken Loach's hard-hitting drama The Wind That Shakes The Barley and science fiction thriller Sunshine, another Boyle production.
""There isn't a genre or a medium the actor has shied away from over the years,"" wrote Variety's Jenelle Riley.
""And while some films might not always work as a whole, Murphy always shines. He's also a true actor's actor, one who understands every role is integral and is comfortable taking on supporting parts.""
One particular role proved key to his career - with Murphy's appearance in 2005's Batman Begins marking his first collaboration with director Christopher Nolan.
Murphy had been asked to audition for the lead role in the first film of the Batman trilogy, and although he did not see himself as being the right fit, the actor jumped at the chance to work with Nolan. His instincts were right, and he was instead cast as Dr Crane, whose alter-ego is the villainous Scarecrow.
Over the following years, Murphy and Nolan reunited on Inception and Dunkirk, and the pair have now worked together on six films.
""It's a 20-year relationship,"" Murphy said. ""We met when we were much younger and we were kind of starting out in the business. He was a lot further ahead than I was.
""I have a huge respect for him, I've always loved the types of films that he makes. There's all sorts of films that I go to the cinema to see. But we've developed over the years.
""Above all, the most important thing, I think, is trust. I really like being pushed as an actor, and he really, really pushes me, in the best way possible.""
Although Murphy's film career was going from strength to strength, it was a BBC drama series about a Birmingham street gang in the early 20th Century that made him a household name.
The actor played Tommy Shelby in Peaky Blinders, and the show's popularity grew over six series as it was sold overseas and audiences caught up on streaming platforms.
As Peaky Blinders drewto a close, Murphy was cast in the role that would define his career so far.
Oppenheimer was released last July - on the same day as Barbie - and the resulting Barbenheimer phenomenon helped propel both to box office success.
Commercial success came with high critical acclaim for Oppenheimer, and it has now cleaned up at the Oscars, with trophies for Murphy and Nolan among seven wins.
The actor already has his next film in the pipeline. Small Things Like These, an intense drama in which he plays a taciturn coal merchant in 1985 Ireland - earned glowing reviews when it opened the Berlin Film Festival last month.
As Hollywood now knows, Murphy is an actor who brings gravitas to every performance - but can still allow himself a well-deserved laugh.

2024-03-02T00:19:36.000Z,"Black female country singers: 'We're tolerated, not celebrated'",BBC News,"Last week, Beyoncé made history on the US country charts - becoming the first black woman to score a number one single, with her latest single Texas Hold 'Em.
The release is the first taste of an entire country album - a follow-up to the house music-focused Renaissance - which Beyoncé has referred to as Act II.
But while she's blazing trails in a genre where black artists have traditionally struggled to gain recognition, there are a handful of black women who've walked that path before her.
Rissi Palmer, 42, from Missouri is one of them. She broke a 20-year wait for a black woman to appear on the country charts with her 2007 single Country Girl. Before her, it was Dona Mason in 1987.
Speaking about Beyoncé's achievement, Rissi told the BBC World Service's OS Conversations documentary: ""I'm glad that a black woman has finally had a number one.
""I think it's absolutely ridiculous that in the history of having this chart, there's only been eight of us. That's not a good thing, it's not a happy thing.
""She's a Houston girl. She's just as southern as anybody else that makes country music. One of the great things about this Beyoncé moment is that it has dispelled this myth that country radio has always tried to teach artists that you have to do things in a certain way for your music to be played.""
It comes after a station in Oklahoma went viral for refusing to play Beyonce's song - saying it didn't consider her new material to be country. After a backlash from fans, the station later added Texas Hold 'Em to the playlist.
But it cuts to the heart of the country music experience for black artists, longing to be accepted into the genre.
Enter Holly G, from Virginia. She's the founder of Black Opry - an organisation dedicated to creating connections between black artists in country and Americana.
""For somebody who loves country music so much, to go so long and not see yourself in it, I just got to a point where I got frustrated with that,"" she says.
""I kind of had a decision to make, I could either stop listening to it or try to figure out a way to make it better. And I decided to stick around and see what we could do.
""I think the way that Beyoncé is being celebrated should be the rule for all of the black women that are trying to work in this space. They're being more tolerated recently than they have been in the past, but they're still not being celebrated.""
""They're still not being included in meaningful ways. And Beyoncé topping the chart changes nothing structurally,"" Holly says.
Black Opry now tours across the US to champion the work of black artists and the change they want to see.
Holly expresses a sense of urgency about the cause, adding: ""There's not going to be another black woman at the top of the country charts, if they behave the way they did before Beyoncé entered the space.""
Rissi chimes in with her agreement, knowing the struggle all too well.
""I was on a radio tour for nearly a year trying to get Country Girl to go up the charts,"" she recalls. ""I wanted to talk about being black, and was kind of told not to do that. So instead I put black girl Easter Eggs in the song.
""I think country means something different to white and black people in America. We don't necessarily long for the good old days, because what were the good old days for us, you know? It was Jim Crow, it was slavery.
""We tend to look toward God, the future and black joy,"" says Rissi.
After a lengthy legal battle, Rissi lost the rights to her master recordings and parted ways with her record label in 2010. She now releases music independently, deciding to move away from the hub of Nashville to North Carolina as she felt it was the ""healthiest thing for her"".
Beyoncé has nodded to the traditional sounds of the genre on Texas Hold 'Em - featuring Grammy Award-winning Rhiannon Giddens playing the banjo, who has been credited for highlighting that black people created and played the banjo before it was popularised by white country artists.
""It's ancestral,"" points out Taylor Crumpton, 28, on the influence of country music in her life. As a black woman from Texas, just like Beyoncé, she reflects on how the genre is connected to her identity.
""I come from a proud line of sharecroppers and cowboys. My grandfather was buried in his cowboy boots,"" she shares.
As a writer, part of her job is to be analytical about the country universe. But for the most part, she says, the connection comes naturally.
""I think it feels more like a warm embrace and a hug from an elder who has passed - or maybe when I spent summers at my grandmother's farm and I'm running from chickens and there's hogs.""
""I've grown up hearing stories from my family members about how they were made fun of for their accent. I think people forget that when Beyoncé first debuted, she was made fun of for her accent in the press.
""In this moment, I've been getting messages from black woman about how they feel like they can come back into a wholeness of self.""
