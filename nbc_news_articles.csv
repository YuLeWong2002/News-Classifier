2024-03-11T20:14:03.468Z,Lady Gaga calls out ‘hatred’ over Dylan Mulvaney’s International Women’s Day post,NBC News,"Pop star Lady Gaga did not mince words in a lengthy Instagram message Monday calling out the negative responses to an International Women’s Day post she was featured in last week with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney.
The initial post, shared Friday from Mulvaney’s Instagram account, included several images and a video of Mulvaney and Lady Gaga with a message that said, “Happy international women’s day.” The day is celebrated annually on March 8. The post garnered more than 340,000 likes and over 3,200 comments, including many that misgendered Mulvaney.
“It’s appalling to me that a post about National Women’s Day by Dylan Mulvaney and me would be met with such vitriol and hatred,” Lady Gaga wrote Monday on Instagram, where she has more than 56 million followers. “This is not backlash. This is hatred.”
While the Grammy- and Oscar-winning singer-songwriter said she was appalled by some of the reactions, she added that they were “not surprising given the immense work that it’s obvious we still have to do as a society to make room for transgender lives to be cherished and upheld by all of us.”
“I feel very protective in this moment, not only of Dylan, but of the trans community who continues to lead the way with their endless grace and inspiration in the face of constant degradation, intolerance, and physical, verbal, and mental violence,” Lady Gaga continued. “I hope all women will come together to honor us ALL for International Women’s Day, and may we do that always until THE DAY that all women are celebrated equally.”
Mulvaney responded to Lady Gaga’s post, writing in the comments, “You mean the world to me. Love ya.”
Mulvaney, a 27-year-old trans advocate, actress and social media star, gained national recognition after she started chronicling her gender transition in October 2022 in her “Days of Girlhood” videos on TikTok, where she currently has more than 10 million followers.
It wasn’t until April of last year, however, when she partnered with Bud Light on a March Madness social media campaign that she became the target of a viral, right-wing hate campaign. In June, Mulvaney responded to the onslaught, revealing in a TikTok video that she was subjected to “more bullying and transphobia than I could have ever imagined.”

2024-03-11T11:04:45.640Z,"Father kills wife and 3 children in murder-suicide at home in Honolulu, police say",NBC News,"A man stabbed his wife and three children to death in their family home in Honolulu before he died by suicide Sunday, police said, in one of the deadliest crimes in Hawaii's capital.
None of the victims have been named. Police said the children were ages 10, 12 and 17. All five were pronounced dead at the scene.
Honolulu Police Lt. Deena Thoemmes said at a news conference that officers were called to reports of an argument at a house in the city's Manoa district around 9 a.m. Sunday and found five people dead.
Their identities will be released in a report from the medical examiner's office, police said.
""Based on the evidence found at the scene and the investigation thus far, it appears that the adult male killed the female and the juveniles with a knife that was recovered from the scene. The motive is still under investigation,"" Thoemmes said.
She added the evidence so far suggests ""these don't appear to be random acts."" Police are interviewing neighbors and reviewing security camera video to find out more.
Thoemmes said the killings were the deadliest crime in Honolulu since seven people were shot dead at a Xerox Corp. building in 1999, still the worst mass shooting to take place in Hawaii.
Police Chief Arthur ""Joe"" Logan said at the news conference: ""I’d like to give our heartfelt condolences to the families. It's unfortunate and very sad.""
He said he visited the crime scene to ensure that his officers were ""mentally and physically fit to do their job, which they are.""
Logan said that officers were first called to the house at 8:30 a.m. and may have knocked on the door and spoken to someone but that they then left without taking any further action — only to return soon after, following another 911 call.
""So really, they didn't have enough information to make entry into the dwelling until we came back at 9 a.m. and spoke to another witness who provided more information,"" Logan said.
He added that such a brutal crime ""doesn't happen in Hawaii very often."" He said the scenes inside the house will stay with the officers ""for the rest of their lives.""
Honolulu Mayor Rick Blangiardi said in a statement that he was ""heartbroken by the tragic incident ... claiming the lives of an entire family, "" Hawaii News Now reported.
Hawaii News Now spoke to neighbors who describe the so-far unnamed family as normal and typical, describing how they would put up decorations for festivals and let the children play in the street.

2024-03-14T07:43:27.843Z,Oklahoma’s push to weaken penalties for cockfighting is frustrating opponents of the bloodsport,NBC News,"WILSON, Okla. — Before Oklahoma became one of the last places in the U.S. to outlaw cockfighting in 2002, it wasn’t uncommon to see hundreds of spectators packed into small arenas in rural parts of the state to watch roosters, often outfitted with razor-sharp steel blades, fight until a bloody death.
More than 20 years after the ban took effect, some worry Oklahoma is starting to waver.
A proposal to weaken cockfighting penalties cleared the Oklahoma House. A political action committee is raising money to support farmers who raise game fowl. And in a video since pulled from YouTube, Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt recorded a message supporting the group known as the Oklahoma Gamefowl Commission, saying he would “cheer you on from the sidelines.”
“They’ve tried to make an official sounding name,” said Wayne Pacelle, president of Animal Wellness Action, which two decades ago worked to turn out Oklahoma voters and outlaw the activity. “But they’re just a bunch of cockfighters.”
He said before the ban, rural Oklahoma counties were peppered with cockfighting arenas set up in large barns with stadium-style seating, overhead lights and even concession stands. Events attracted hundreds of spectators, even children and families. After a major event, it wasn’t uncommon to see the property littered with dead bird carcasses after fights to the death.
“We went from 42 arenas, to... maybe there are 10 or 15 pits in the state,” he said.
The reemergence of cockfighting as an issue in the Oklahoma Capitol is frustrating opponents who, until recently, considered the matter long settled. Rooster fighting is illegal at the federal level, punishable by up to five years in prison for some offenses. But a spate of recent cockfighting-related arrests in both Oklahoma and elsewhere is also a reminder that the practice has not been eliminated so much as driven underground.
Police in Hawaii have vowed to step up enforcement after one of the most serious mass shootings in that state’s history happened last year at a cockfight where five people were shot, including two who died.
For his part, Stitt said he records dozens of videos each week and didn’t give his participation much thought. “Of course, I’m not for gamecock fighting in the state of Oklahoma,” he told The Associated Press. But he also suggested he is open to reducing penalties if the state’s GOP-controlled Legislature sends him a bill.
The video unleashed bipartisan blowback across Oklahoma, including from former Gov. Frank Keating, a fellow Republican. Oklahoma football legend Barry Switzer — whose nickname in the state is simply “The King” after winning three national championships and a Super Bowl with the Dallas Cowboys — also came after Stitt.
But the backlash doesn’t faze Anthony Devore, head of the Gamefowl Commission, who says his organization has 15,000 members and described them as mostly hard-working rural Oklahomans. His group has raised more than $70,000 to lobby lawmakers and is seeking to replicate the same model in several other conservative Southern states, including in Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky and Mississippi.
Devore said he and others raise the birds to participate in poultry shows and sell them as breeding stock overseas. While cockfighting is illegal in many countries, it remains legal and popular in some Mexican states, the Philippines and some countries in southeast Asia.
“We represent game fowl farmers who breed and raise game fowl, but not for fighting purposes,” said Devore, himself a game fowl breeder.
But Devore acknowledged a former district director for his organization who has since resigned was arrested and charged with facilitating a cockfight after authorities in Carter County raided a cockfighting pit with more than 100 people in attendance. That criminal case is pending.
Devore and other members acknowledge they’re operating in a gray area of the law and say reducing the penalties would remove the fear of felony criminal charges hanging over their heads.
The effort is welcome news to Troy Thompson, a former high school teacher and coach who now works full-time raising thousands of birds every year on his 55-acre ranch dotted with white, tent-like structures near the town of Wilson in far southern Oklahoma, just 30 miles north of the Red River border with Texas.
Thompson, 50, said the chickens on his farm, who are kept on foot tethers so they don’t fight with one another, are given vitamins, green grass year round and the highest quality feed he can buy. He said his chickens have a much better life than they would on a typical poultry farm, where they’re raised in a tiny cage and slaughtered at about six weeks old.
“I had a rooster pass away last week that was 10 years old,” he said. “They have a lot better life living here than they’re going to have on a Tyson poultry farm.”
Thompson said he grew during a time when rooster fighting was legal and dozens of farms dotted the rolling hills of southern Oklahoma. The name of his boyhood T-ball team was the Dillard Fighting Cocks.
“Would that go over today?” he asked. “It’s mind blowing that you went from perfectly legal to facing a 10-year prison sentence.”
And while some law enforcement officers and prosecutors have been cracking down recently on those who raise and fight birds, with busts recently in both urban and rural communities, prosecutors say it’s unlikely anyone has been sentenced to prison for cockfighting.
“I would say there’s probably almost none (in prison),” said Greg Mashburn, the top prosecutor for three central Oklahoma counties. “In the 18 years I’ve been DA, we’ve only had two cases.”
Still, Mashburn said it’s important to enforce anti-cockfighting laws because there is often a criminal element engaged in the activity that often involves illegal drugs and gambling.
“It’s also cruel to the animals,” Mashburn said. “And where do you draw the line? If we allow that with chickens, why not dogs or other animals fighting to the death?”
Still, some animal rights supporters say other local sheriffs and prosecutors often turn a blind eye to the practice. Although the cockfighting ban passed in 2002 with 56% of the vote, 57 of the state’s 77 counties were in favor of keeping cockfighting legal.
Drew Edmondson, a former county prosecutor and attorney general for Oklahoma, now serves as a law enforcement co-chair for Animal Wellness Action. He said it’s easy to understand why some elected officials in Oklahoma, even sheriffs, might look the other way when it comes to cockfighting.
He called it a combination of money and politics.
“For local politicians, it’s a pretty easy call when 60, 70, 80% of their county voted ‘no’ on the issue, to soft pedal it and not treat it like a serious crime,” he said.

2024-03-11T14:56:02.360Z,Virginia bans public universities from considering legacy in admissions,NBC News,"Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin signed a bill banning considering legacy in public university admissions, making the commonwealth the second state to end admission advantages through family connections.
Such ties to alumni and donors cannot be taken into consideration for application under the terms of House Bill 48, which Youngkin, a Republican, signed Friday.
That family connections will no longer be of any help to applicants to such prestigious institutions as the University of Virginia and the College of William & Mary.
The University of Virginia and William & Mary were ranked the Nos. 24 and 53 national universities in the most recent ratings by U.S. News & World Report. No. 47 Virginia Tech, in Blacksburg, announced last year that it had removed legacy from its admissions calculations.
Colorado adopted a legacy ban in 2021.
Proponents of affirmative action have long taken aim at legacy — but particularly so in recent months after the conservative U.S. Supreme Court in June struck down policies at the University of North Carolina and Harvard that had included race as a consideration for admission.
Affirmative action supporters argue that legacy boosts applicants who were born into privilege. Rep Barbara Lee, D-Calif., has bluntly said that ""affirmative action still exists for white people. It’s called legacy admissions.""
Virginia state Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, a Democrat, hailed the state's ""bipartisan"" agreement ""to ban legacy preferences in college admissions.""
""We were the first state post-Students for Fair Admissions to do so,"" he said a in a statement Monday, referring to the Supreme Court case.
U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said he hopes the legacy ban becomes a national movement.
""Proud to see Virginia be a leader in banning legacy admissions at colleges and universities,"" Kaine said in statement. ""Now Congress should pass my bipartisan bill to do the same nationwide.""

2024-03-14T01:17:08.748Z,Mississippi Medicaid expansion is at a crossroads over work requirement,NBC News,"In Mississippi, the poorest state in the nation, Republican lawmakers have loosened their decadelong resistance to expanding Medicaid and making health insurance available to roughly 200,000 of the state’s low-income residents.
But some Republican leaders have said they will not approve a bill without a work requirement, a provision critics say could still leave the most vulnerable Mississippians behind.
Medicaid expansion would bring coverage to state residents with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level — $20,783 for an individual, or $35,632 for a family of three. Currently, families of three with earnings up to 28% of the poverty level or $7,230 are eligible.
But many health policy experts, advocates and politicians say the work requirement would limit the bill’s reach. In a largely rural state, residents who lack employment, child care and transportation options could face insurmountable hurdles in meeting the work requirement and gaining access to Medicaid.
“There’s always this Gordian knot that poor people have to untie just to even get to the services they deserve,” said Leroy Johnson, a supervisor in Holmes County, where more than a third of residents live in poverty.
“We don’t have the number of jobs we need in the county, so that means the folks got to go outside of the county,” which often means driving dozens of miles to larger employers, he said. “In order to have a good working vehicle,” he added, “you’ve got to have money to buy it.”
People with long periods of illness could also be shut out.
Jara Harvey, 26, worked as a nurse in a college town about 80 miles from her home outside of Jackson before a condition that causes extreme fatigue and difficulty walking hindered her ability to work. Her parents have covered her on a private insurance plan, she explained, but it costs them $281 per month.
She’s applied for disability benefits but has been waiting months for approval. Legislators intent on a work requirement, she said, are ignoring people like her.
“If there was a requirement for me to work, there’s no way on God’s earth I would be able to do it,” she said.
The House bill, which passed on Feb. 28., includes a work mandate but would allow Medicaid expansion to advance without one.
The Senate has until Thursday to vote on its own bill, which thus far is a placeholder, or “dummy bill,” without key details. Senate Medicaid Committee Chair Kevin Blackwell has said that he doesn’t think a deal can be reached without a stronger work requirement than the one passed by the House.
But that’s likely to bump up against resistance from the federal government, which has pushed to limit hurdles to enrollment. Thirteen states sought permission for work requirements under the Trump administration. Several backed away from them after legal challenges. Under the Biden administration, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has also revoked previous approvals for the requirements.
Arkansas, which no longer has a work requirement, was the only state whose Medicaid program penalized beneficiaries who failed to work. At least 18,000 residents lost coverage while the requirement was in effect.
Medicaid recipients were required to log their work hours online, presenting a challenge for those who lacked internet service. Researchers found that many low-income adults were unaware of the policy, putting them at risk of being wrongfully kicked off.
In Georgia, the only state with an active work requirement, only 2,344 residents gained coverage in the first six months of the expansion, according to the state. The program, an alternative to traditional Medicaid expansion known as Georgia Pathways to Coverage, serves residents making up to 100 percent of the federal poverty line and doesn’t qualify for the federal government’s match that would pick up nearly all of the state’s tab.
As the South struggles with rural hospital closures, some advocates see Medicaid expansion as a way to help them keep their doors open. Growing a state’s share of insured residents can help decrease the amount of uncompensated care — treatment to patients who are uninsured or otherwise unable to pay — that hospitals provide.
Laura Harker, senior policy analyst with the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan research group, said the low enrollments in Georgia’s program have limited its impact.
“That’s more people than before, which is nice,” she said. “But for hospitals and health systems, that’s not making a big dent in their high uninsured rate and the rural hospital closure rate.”
In Mississippi, the future of Medicaid expansion is murky. Gov. Tate Reeves, a Republican, reiterated his opposition to the expansion on X, formerly known as Twitter, after President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address last week. “Our country is going broke and he wants to add millions more to the welfare rolls,” he wrote after the president praised the Affordable Care Act. “We have to stand strong in Mississippi! NO Obamacare Medicaid expansion!”
Lawmakers would need the support of two-thirds of both chambers to override his veto.
Still, House Minority Leader Robert Johnson, a Democrat, is not willing to dismiss the momentum of the first Medicaid expansion proposal to advance this far in the state.
For years, none were even brought up for a vote in committee.
“We will fight to perfect a bill to make it as good as we can make it,” he said. “But at some point, we will realize this is as good as we can do, because some Medicaid expansion is better than no Medicaid expansion.”
CORRECTION (March 13, 2024, 9:17 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated the income figure for 138% of the federal poverty level for an individual. It is $20,783, not $20,873.

2024-03-11T21:10:40.828Z,"Florida teachers can discuss sexual orientation, gender ID under ‘Don’t Say Gay’ settlement",NBC News,"ORLANDO, Fla. — Students and teachers will be able to speak freely about sexual orientation and gender identity in Florida classrooms, provided it’s not part of instruction, under a settlement reached Monday between Florida education officials and civil rights attorneys who had challenged a state law which critics dubbed “Don’t Say Gay.”
The settlement clarifies what is allowed in Florida classrooms following passage two years ago of the law prohibiting instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in early grades. Opponents said the law had created confusion about whether teachers could identity themselves as LGBTQ or if they even could have rainbow stickers in classrooms.
Other states used the Florida law as a template to pass prohibitions on classroom instruction on gender identity or sexual orientation. Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky and North Carolina are among the states with versions of the law.
Under the terms of the settlement, the Florida Board of Education will send instructions to every school district saying the Florida law doesn’t prohibit discussing LGBTQ people, nor prevent anti-bullying rules on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity or disallow Gay-Straight Alliance groups. The settlement also spells out that the law is neutral — meaning what applies to LGBTQ people also applies to heterosexual people — and that it doesn’t apply to library books not being used in the classroom.
“What this settlement does, is, it re-establishes the fundamental principal, that I hope all Americans agree with, which is every kid in this country is entitled to an education at a public school where they feel safe, their dignity is respected and where their families and parents are welcomed,” Roberta Kaplan, the lead attorney for the plaintiffs, said in an interview. “This shouldn’t be a controversial thing.”
In a statement, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’s office described the deal as a “major win” with the law remaining intact.
“Today’s mutually agreed settlement ensures that the law will remain in effect and it is expected that the case will be dismissed by the Court imminently,” the statement said.
The law, formally known as the Parental Rights in Education Act, has been championed by the Republican governor since before its passage in 2022 by the GOP-controlled Florida Legislature. It barred instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through the third grade, and it was expanded to all grades last year.
Republican lawmakers had argued that parents should broach these subjects with children and that the law protected children from being taught about inappropriate material.
But opponents of the law said it created a chilling effect in classrooms. Some teachers said they were unsure if they could mention or display a photo of their same-sex partner in the classroom. In some cases, books dealing with LGBTQ topics were removed from classrooms and lines mentioning sexual orientation were excised from school musicals. The Miami-Dade County School Board in 2022 decided not to adopt a resolution recognizing LGBTQ History Month, even though it had done so a year earlier.
The law also triggered the ongoing legal battles between DeSantis and Disney over control of the governing district for Walt Disney World in central Florida after DeSantis took control of the government in what the company described as retaliation for its opposition to the legislation. DeSantis touted the fight with Disney during his run for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination, which he ended earlier this year.
The civil rights attorneys sued Florida education officials on behalf of teachers, students and parents, claiming the law was unconstitutional, but the case was dismissed last year by a federal judge in Tallahassee who said they lacked standing to sue. The case was appealed to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals.
Kaplan said they believed the appellate court would have reversed the lower court’s decision, but continuing the lawsuit would have delayed any resolution for several more years.
“The last thing we wanted for the kids in Florida was more delay,” Kaplan said.

2024-03-12T02:46:44.318Z,Lakers say typos on Kobe Bryant statue outside team's arena to be corrected,NBC News,"The Los Angeles Lakers said Monday that spelling errors on a Kobe Bryant statue unveiled last month outside the team's arena will be corrected.
The errors were pointed out and amplified by German journalist André Voigt, who published his finds Sunday on X. They include spelling Toronto guard José Calderón as “Jose Calderson"" and spelling former Laker Von Wafer as “Vom Wafer,"" according to NBC Los Angeles.
The word ""decision"" is set in bronze as ""decicion,"" the station said.
The statue’s pose was inspired by the late player’s index-finger-in-the-air postgame response to his epic 81-point game in the Lakers’ 122-104 win against the Toronto Raptors on Jan. 22, 2006.
It was the second most points a single player had scored in an NBA game. Wilt Chamberlain’s 100 points in the then-Philadelphia Warriors’ 169-147 win against the New York Knicks in 1962 remains the high mark.
The 19-foot statue of Bryant, who spent his entire career with the Lakers, features a re-creation of the Toronto game’s scorecard, where Calderón and Wafer's names, as well as ""decision,"" are spelled correctly, NBC Los Angeles said.
“We have been aware of this for a few weeks and are already working to get it corrected soon,"" a Lakers spokesperson said in a statement Monday.
The bronze of Bryant in his earlier No. 8 jersey was unveiled Feb. 8 at Star Plaza outside Crypto.com Arena in downtown Los Angeles.
Widow Vanessa Bryant said at the event that it would be the first of three statues commissioned to immortalize the five-time NBA championship winner.
The others include Bryant in his No. 24 jersey and Bryant with daughter Gianna, who died with him and seven other people in a helicopter crash in January 2020.

2024-03-09T01:17:59.954Z,"Broken power pole and downed wires caused largest fire in Texas history, investigator says",NBC News,"The largest wildfire in Texas history was caused by a power line after a pole that “appeared to be decayed at the base” fell into a grassy area, a Texas A&M Forest Service investigator concluded in a report released Friday.
The Smokehouse Creek fire has burned more than 1 million acres in the Texas Panhandle since it broke out on Feb. 26 near the small town of Stinnett.
Fueled by high winds, it was one of several large fires in the Panhandle that have killed two people and destroyed an estimated 500 structures.
The cause of the Smokehouse Creek fire was determined to be a power line, the investigation report from the Texas A&M Forest Service, a state agency, concluded.
A “power pole that appeared to be decayed at the base where it made contact with ground had broken off at ground level,” the investigator wrote, adding that the pole, the cross member and wires fell and made contact with fine grassy fuels.
Utility company Xcel Energy said Thursday that “its facilities appear to have been involved in an ignition of the Smokehouse Creek fire,” but it disputed any claims that the company acted negligently in maintaining its infrastructure.
The Texas A&M Forest Service investigation report does not allege negligence.
A lawsuit filed by a homeowner last week against Xcel Energy Services, Southwestern Public Service Company and Osmose Utility Services claimed they “failed to properly inspect, maintain, and replace” the pole that fell.
The Smokehouse Creek fire has burned 1,058,482 acres and was 87% contained Friday, the Texas A&M Forest Service said.
A power line also caused another of the wildfires in the Panhandle, the Windy Deuce fire, the forest service said.
That fire was reported at 6:23 p.m. on Feb. 26 at an oil field, and was caused when a power line that “ran directly thru the top of a small tree” made contact with tree limbs, a forest service report concludes.
That contact caused a spark or molten metal that fell into grass below, the report said.
A spokesman for Xcel Energy said the company does not believe its equipment was involved in causing that fire, and is not aware of any allegations that its equipment was involved.
There are power lines owned by other companies in the area where the Windy Deuce fire began, Xcel spokesperson Kevin Coss said.
The Texas A&M Forest Service investigation reports do not mention which company owns the lines in either fire.
The Windy Deuce fire was at 144,045 acres Friday and was 92% contained, the forest service said. Firefighters continued to mop up and patrol the fire area, it said.

Michael Christian Green was charged with one federal count of deprivation of rights under color of law, according to a criminal information filed earlier this month.
The document alleges that Green, who was a patrolman for the Pearl Police Department, forced someone to lick urine off the cell floor after a December arrest.
The man, who was being booked after a disturbance at a Sam’s Club on Dec. 23, knocked on the door of a holding cell and said he needed to urinate, prosecutors wrote.
After a period of time, the man urinated in a corner, the document states. Green allegedly threatened to beat him with a phone and commanded him to “lick it up,” prosecutors wrote.
Green stood in a doorway while the man, who gagged and later vomited in a trash can, did so, the document says. Green recorded it on his cellphone, prosecutors wrote.
Green was charged by criminal information this month, but the case was unsealed Wednesday, according to court records. Informations are typically used by the Justice Department to charge in cases where people have agreed to plead guilty.
Green’s attorney did not immediately return requests for comment Wednesday night. Court records do not indicate a plea, and an initial appearance was scheduled for Thursday.
A Pearl Police Department spokesman did not immediately return a call seeking more details about Green's employment or status Wednesday night.
Pearl is a city of around 27,000 east of Jackson.

2024-03-11T17:20:06.676Z,2 Georgia men indicted on charges of setting off bomb at woman's home and plotting to release python to 'eat' her daughter,NBC News,"Two Georgia men have been federally indicted in connection with a ""sinister"" plot they allegedly hatched last year to release a python to devour the daughter of one of their ex's, prosecutors announced.
Stephen Glosser, 37, and Caleb Kinsey, 34, of Richmond Hill, were arrested in February 2023 on charges of setting off a homemade bomb at the home of a woman with whom one of them had a previous relationship.
On Thursday, they were indicted on multiple federal charges related to the bombing and their alleged plot — which included mailing dog feces to the ex's home, releasing a snake in her residence, and scalping her, the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Southern District of Georgia announced.
They had plotted to acquire and release “a large python into the victim’s home to eat the victim’s daughter,” the release said.
The men face charges that include stalking, conspiracy to use an explosive to commit a felony, use of an explosive to commit another felony offense, and possession of an unregistered device. Kinsey was further charged with false statement during the purchase of a firearm and possession of firearms by a convicted felon.
The men had the victim under surveillance from December 2022 to January 2023 “with the intent to kill, injure, harass, or intimidate,” prosecutors said in a news release.
They conspired to shoot arrows into the victim’s front door, mail dog feces or dead rats to the victim’s home, scalp her and blow up her home.
Glosser located the victim’s home using internet searches and mapped out a path to her residence, prosecutors said. Kinsey then allegedly acquired and built an explosive device at Glosser’s home using Tannerite, which he purportedly purchased online.
Then the two used it to blow up the victim’s home on Jan. 13, 2023, the prosecutors said.
On that day, Bryan County emergency services responded to a report of an explosion at a residential structure on Demeries Lake Court in Richmond Hill at 5 a.m., Georgia’s Office of Commissioner of Insurance and Safety Fire said in a release.
A multi-agency investigation found the cause of the explosion was an “IED comprised of a binary explosive compound.”
No one was injured in the explosion, WTOC of Savannah reported at the time.
The agency announced Glosser and Kinsey were arrested in connection with the explosion. Kinsey had fled the state and was arrested in Louisiana, and Glosser was arrested locally.
Bryan County Sheriff Mark Crowe previously described the attack as ""sinister.""
He told WJCL-TV of Savannah that a woman and child had moved into the residence the day before the explosion — and one of the suspects had a prior relationship with the woman.
Glosser and Kinsey are in custody awaiting further court proceedings. The docket for the federal case did not list lawyers for the men.
Prosecutors said that, if convicted, the conspiracy charge carries a statutory penalty of up to 20 years in prison, and the charge of using an explosive to commit a felony carries a penalty of an additional 10 years. The release noted, given these are federal charges, the men won't be eligible for parole.

2024-03-13T19:58:22.737Z,3 men face federal firearms charges in Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl parade shooting,NBC News,"Three men face federal firearm charges in connection to the Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl parade that left one person dead and 22 others injured.
Fedo Antonia Manning, 22, was charged in a 12-count criminal complaint unsealed Wednesday, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Missouri said.
Ronnel Dewayne Williams, Jr., 21, and Chaelyn Hendrick Groves, 19, were charged in a four-count federal criminal complaint.
The defendants are not accused of opening fire on Feb. 14 in downtown Kansas City, next to Union Station, where the parade had ended and the rally was held. Two juveniles were arrested by police and charged last month in a Jackson County court on gun-related and resisting arrest offenses.
Federal authorities, instead, said Manning, Williams and Groves were involved in illegal firearms trafficking and straw purchases of firearms.
A straw purchase, as defined by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, involves someone who purchases a gun for someone who is prohibited by law from possessing one or for someone who does not want their name associated with the transaction.
""At least two of the firearms recovered from the scene of the mass shooting at Union Station were illegally purchased or trafficked,"" U.S. Attorney Teresa Moore said in a statement. ""We work diligently with our law enforcement partners to keep firearms out of the hands of criminals by investigating and prosecuting those who illegally buy and sell dangerous weapons.""
Twelve people brandished firearms and at least six people fired their weapons during the shooting, according to court documents. Authorities believe the shooting stemmed from a dispute among several people.
Police recovered several firearms, spent shell casings, and other items from the scene, the U.S. Attorney's Office said.
One of the firearms found at the scene was a loaded pistol. It was in a backpack next to two AR-15-style firearms and backpacks, the U.S. Attorney’s Office said. An affidavit alleges that the pistol was purchased by Manning in 2022.
The affidavit also accuses Manning, who was not a licensed firearms dealer, of purchasing dozens of guns, many of which were recovered by law enforcement in the possession of people who were prohibited from having firearms.
Several other firearms allegedly purchased by Manning had been recovered during investigations of various crimes, the U.S. Attorney's Office said.
He was charged with one count of conspiracy to traffic firearms, one count of engaging in firearm sales without a license, and 10 counts of making a false statement on a federal form. It's not clear if Manning has obtained an attorney.
Another pistol found at the scene was allegedly purchased by Williams during a gun show last year. Federal authorities said he bought the gun for Groves, who accompanied him to the gun show but was too young to legally purchase a firearm of his own.
Groves told investigators that the firearm was stolen during a ""shootout"" but he did not report it and had another friend purchase him a different one, the U.S. Attorney's Office said.
Manning and Williams also allegedly bought firearm receivers or frames, which house the firing mechanism and other internal parts of a firearm, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office. Receivers can be used to build illegal firearms or can be loaded and fired, the office said.
The criminal complaint charged Williams and Groves together with one count of conspiracy to make false statements in the acquisition of firearms and one count of aiding and abetting making false statements in the acquisition of firearms. They are each charged separately with one count of making a false statement to a federal agent. It's not clear if they have an attorney who can speak on their behalf.

2024-03-09T00:13:09.867Z,Investigation finds Colorado DNA analyst intentionally manipulated data,NBC News,"A Colorado Bureau of Investigation DNA analyst intentionally manipulated data in the testing process for at least 15 years, according to an internal affairs investigation.
Yvonne “Missy” Woods, a now-former DNA scientist who worked at the CBI crime lab for 29 years, has been under investigation since September 2023, according to the bureau, known as CBI.
The investigation concluded that Woods manipulated data in the DNA testing process and in some cases posted incomplete test results.
“At this time, 652 cases have been identified as affected by Woods’ data manipulation between 2008 and 2023,” the CBI said in a release. “A review of Woods’ work from 1994 to 2008 is also underway.”
The investigation, dated Feb. 26, found Woods ""Omitted material facts in official criminal justice records,"" ""Tampered with DNA testing results by omitting some of those results,"" and violated the bureau's code of conduct and lab policies ""ranging from data retention to quality control measures.""
According to the investigation, a DNA forensics team found Woods manipulated her work by deleting and changing data that hid the fact that she interfered with controls and failed to troubleshoot problems that arose during the testing process. It also found she did not provide adequate documentation in case records related to tests she performed.
""These manipulations appear to have been the result of intentional conduct on the part of Woods,"" the CBI said.
The CBI said the findings “puts all of her work in question.""
Ryan Brackley, an attorney representing Woods, said she ""will continue to cooperate with law enforcement to preserve the integrity of her work that resulted in true and just criminal justice findings — whether arrests, convictions or exonerations.""
The bureau launched the investigation in September after becoming aware that a DNA sample testing performed by Woods ""may have deviated from standard operating procedures.""
Woods was placed on administrative leave on Oct. 3, and later retired from her post on Nov. 6. The CBI said she did not perform any additional lab work during that time.
Since Oct. 3, the CBI, in collaboration with members of the Kansas Bureau of Investigation, looked into all of Woods' work over the course of her 29-year career with the bureau.
Ultimately, the review did not find that Wood ""falsified DNA matches or otherwise fabricated DNA profiles.""
""She instead deviated from standard testing protocols and cut corners, calling into question the reliability of the testing she conducted,"" CBI said, adding that Woods ""should have conducted additional testing to ensure the reliability of her results in these affected cases.""
Her attorney said the investigation's findings ""support Ms. Woods earlier statements she’s never created or reported any false inculpatory DNA matches or exclusions, nor has she testified falsely in any hearing or trial resulting in a false conviction or unjust imprisonment.""
A separate criminal investigation into Woods launched late last year is still underway, according to the CBI.
The CBI said it is working to implement changes that will ""enhance the integrity of its testing processes and their results"" and to prevent this kind of issue from arising in the future.
""Public trust in our institutions is critical to the fulfillment of our mission,"" CBI Director Chris Schaefer said. ""Our actions in rectifying this unprecedented breach of trust will be thorough and transparent.""
The bureau said it is also working through an audit of all of its DNA analysts ""to ensure the accuracy and completeness of its entire catalog of records.""
Over the course of the audit, the CBI found that an additional analyst who works for the Weld County Sheriff’s Office at the Northern Colorado Regional Forensic Laboratory may have also manipulated DNA testing data, but noted that this case is separate from Woods'.
That analyst, Chiara Wuensch, was fired by the Weld County Sheriff’s Office last month after an internal investigation that centered on “anomalies” in her work. The investigation, which began Jan. 31, found she “violated the Weld County Code for expectations of proper conduct, and the sheriff’s office standards of conduct policy for not cooperating with the agency’s internal investigation,” according to the sheriff’s office.
Wuensch did not immediately respond to a request for comment on her termination or the circumstances surrounding it.
The sheriff's office said it intends to pursue criminal charges against Weunsch.

2024-03-11T14:53:13.623Z,NAACP calls on Black student-athletes to boycott Florida public colleges over anti-DEI policy,NBC News,"The head of the NAACP is calling on Black student-athletes to reconsider their decisions to attend public colleges and universities in Florida, challenging a new state policy that bars those institutions from using government funds on diversity, equity and inclusion programs.
In a letter sent Monday to current and future student-athletes of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, NAACP leader Derrick Johnson implored college-bound Black athletes to “choose wisely.”
“Diversity, equity, and inclusion are paramount to ensuring equitable and effective educational outcomes,” Johnson said in a statement accompanying the letter, which was first reported by NBC News. “The value Black and other college athletes bring to large universities is unmatched.”
“If these institutions are unable to completely invest in those athletes, it’s time they take their talents elsewhere,” said Johnson, the civil rights organization’s president and chief executive.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis last year signed a bill that largely prohibits public colleges and universities from using state and federal funds on programs commonly grouped together under the acronym DEI.
Johnson’s letter was sent 10 days after the University of Florida eliminated all diversity, equity and inclusion positions in accordance with a state rule — a move that drew condemnation from NFL Hall of Famer Emmitt Smith, an alum of the school, who said on X that minority athletes there should “be aware and vocal about this decision.”
In response to a request for comment Monday, a spokeswoman for DeSantis directed NBC News to a March 1 tweet from the governor. ""DEI is toxic and has no place in our public universities,"" he said on X. ""I'm glad that Florida was the first state to eliminate DEI and I hope more states follow suit.""
In recent years, Republican politicians, conservative activists and right-wing social media influencers have railed against DEI programs and an array of sociopolitical ideas they characterize as “wokeness.” The proponents of DEI in education have argued that such efforts are essential to make schools more racially and socially inclusive.
Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, signed a law last year ordering DEI offices at all state-funded colleges and universities to shut down. In the current legislative session, GOP lawmakers in more than 30 states have introduced or passed more than 100 bills to either restrict or regulate DEI efforts writ large, according to an NBC News analysis.
Meanwhile, the mayor of Birmingham, Alabama, said on social media last month that if his state passed a bill to block funding for DEI in public colleges, he would encourage student-athletes to seek out programs in other states.
Florida is a major player in Division I athletics. The University of Florida, Florida State University and the University of South Florida are homes to some of the most prominent football and basketball programs in the country.
Florida college athletics are also big business. The University of Florida’s sports teams, for example, generated more than $177 million in revenue in a one-year period spanning July 1, 2021, through June 30, 2022, according to data compiled by the U.S. Department of Education.
NAACP leader Johnson, in his letter to student-athletes, said he recognized that not all Black student-athletes have the financial freedom to participate in a boycott of Florida’s public school system.
“While it is our duty to spread awareness, and encourage action around these egregious assaults, we also recognize that protest can come at a price,” Johnson said. “The sad reality is, for many Black student-athletes, collegiate sports may be their sole opportunity at achieving the upward mobility necessary to propel them into their rightful places in society.”
“This imbalance of power and profit demands a response,” Johnson went on to say, “particularly because these institutions reap considerable financial benefits from the very individuals they fail to stand by in matters of diversity, equity, and inclusion. If any institution is to reap the benefits of Black talent, it is only right that they completely invest in Black futures.”

2024-03-13T14:56:39.243Z,A $22 burrito? San Francisco restaurant owner says he's keeping up with inflation,NBC News,"A restaurant in San Francisco’s Mission District is catching attention online after recently bumping the price of its signature burrito from $11 to $22.
The owner of La Vaca Birria says it’s not an attempt to make more money, but an attempt to continue to break even as prices for everything rise.
When you walk into the restaurant, it smells, “either like birria, or charcoal,” said Ricardo Lopez, owner of La Vaca Birria.
For the last two years, he has operated the spot -- built out of a former record store in the Mission.
His vision has been to make the kind of food his aunts, uncles and mother used to make — but kicked up a notch.
The only problem is, the price of nearly everything he uses to make his food has gone up. Like onions for example.
“Before COVID, they were like $9 a sack at Restaurant Depot, I used to pick them up. During COVID, and after, it was $40 dollars. Right now, it’s $80,” said Lopez.
Their signature burrito is the most popular and nearly every ingredient that goes into it has doubled in cost. That’s the reason the owner said its price has, too.
In fact, the latest Consumer Price Index shows prices for food, gas and housing all rose last month nationwide.
To be fair, Lopez has also made a conscious decision to buy premium beef to make his birria — which is Mexican marinated beef.
And has chosen not to buy any prepared foods from suppliers. Meaning everything is made from scratch — with the exception of the tortillas — which he gets from a local shop.
And all that effort is also reflected in the prices.
“The food that you make in your pueblo back in Mexico, it’s very labor intensive,” said Lopez. “And the only way you get that here is at those fine dining restaurants, doing everything from scratch.”
Judging from the lunch rush on Tuesday, his decision not to skimp on ingredients, or cut staff, seems to be paying off.
“If it just takes us as consumers to pay a little bit more to support people’s dreams, and get really good food back, then that’s fine with me,” said customer Rain Damon Espinas.
And Lopez said he knows people can choose to go to the burrito shop a few doors down for a $9 dollar option, which he says is good too.
And for regulars who have decided to cut back, Lopez said, “It’s either that or keep the price the same, don’t make any money and we close our doors at one point.”

2024-03-14T00:19:51.863Z,"Georgia woman gets stuck under conveyor, dies while trying to get AirPod, authorities say",NBC News,"A Georgia woman died last week after she dropped an AirPod under a conveyor and got caught in a chain that moves the machine while reaching for it, authorities said.
According to an incident report from the Columbia County Sheriff’s Office, a witness told investigators that line worker Alyssa Drinkard, 21, dropped the AirPod below the conveyor while on shift at a plant for Club Car around 9:45 p.m. Friday.
The company makes golf carts and other vehicles.
When she tried to get the earbud from under the machine, she got caught in the chain that moves the conveyor, the witness said, according to the report.
Due to the way Drinkard was pinned, the witness — identified as fellow worker Fae’Zsha Smith — ""was not able to get her out, so she called for maintenance to come and shut the machine down. They began taking it apart once the machine was down and called 911,"" the report says.
Emergency personnel freed Drinkard, of Grovetown, “by cutting the metal frame from around the conveyor and pulling her out,"" the report indicates.
Drinkard still had a pulse when she was freed from the machine, and emergency personnel performed life-saving measures on her before she was hospitalized, the incident report said.
Club Car did not respond to NBC News' request for comment Wednesday afternoon. In a statement to The Augusta Press, the company confirmed a worker on Friday night sustained critical injuries at its primary manufacturing facility in Evans before dying.
“First responders were immediately notified, and we thank them for their quick response to provide medical care and transportation to the hospital where the worker unfortunately later passed away,"" the company said. ""Our sincere condolences and thoughts are with the family, friends and all impacted by this loss. We are working with authorities and the contractor in an investigation to determine the facts about what led to the incident.""
Smith, 25, said Wednesday that she has not been able to shake the images of Drinkard lodged under the conveyor.
""I'm kind of traumatized from seeing her that way,"" Smith said, her voice sometimes quivering as she remembered her former colleague.
Drinkard was working across from Smith when Drinkard said she dropped an AirPod under the conveyor, Smith said.
Smith then looked under the machine and saw the earbud. She recalled telling Drinkard that she'd get it for her once it was safe to do so.
""She said, 'It's OK, I'll just get new ones,'"" Smith said.
Only second passed before Smith said she looked down and saw a horrifying scene.
The machine caught Drinkard's arm, Smith said, noting that it was bent and there was a significant amount of blood after Drinkard tried to reach for the AirPod from her side of the work station.
Drinkard had worked at the plant for about a year, Smith said, and was quiet but well-liked by other line workers. Drinkard was invited to go out with colleagues, and would only sometimes show up, but when she did, her presence was always noticed, Smith said.
“When she did come out, it was always laughs. She was always so sweet. She was always had a smile on her face,"" Smith said.
Drinkard’s relatives could not immediately be reached for comment Wednesday afternoon.
Smith, who has not returned to work since the incident, said she's unsure if she ever will because she has concerns about her safety.
According to Club Car’s website, the company, based in Augusta, has been an industry leader in making golf carts for decades. The company says on its website that it makes the official golf cart for the PGA of America, PGA TOUR Tournament Players Club Network and European Tour.
According to the site, the company was once called one of the country's safest.

2024-03-08T18:33:12.849Z,Ronny Chieng thinks representation still matters when it comes to animated films,NBC News,"In the new film “Kung Fu Panda 4,” comedian Ronny Chieng, much like his castmates, doesn’t voice anyone who remotely resembles himself. He doesn’t even voice a human. He’s a grumpy fish that lives inside of a pelican’s mouth.
But that doesn’t mean that the representation behind the screen doesn’t matter in this case, he said. Even though the characters in the film are all animated, the movie’s undeniably Asian elements and homage to Chinese culture are bolstered by the presence of its heavily Asian cast, Chieng told NBC News — one that features some heavy hitters like Ke Huy Quan, Awkwafina and James Hong.
He said part of the appeal is that Asians everywhere can get behind the film. “Despite being made in America by Americans, people in China love it,” too, he said, because they cast “people who are authentic to the source material to do the voices for it.”
“I think all those little things add up to the overall kind of authenticity and love of the movie,” he said.
The film, which opens Friday, follows lovable panda Po, voiced by the returning Jack Black, as he’s tasked with appointing a successor to his esteemed role as the Dragon Warrior. But Po, who’s expected to move on as the spiritual leader of the Valley of Peace, isn’t thrilled to do so, still enamored with the glory and action that comes with being a kung fu fighter. The search, however, takes a turn when a thieving fox named Zhen, voiced by Awkwafina, comes into the picture. To get herself out of trouble, Zhen distracts Po with word of a treacherous sorceress, the Chameleon, voiced by Viola Davis. And the pair set off to search for the villain. Chieng’s character, Captain Fish, is hired to ferry the pair to Juniper City, where the Chameleon’s Palace lies.
The role adds to Chieng’s vast body of work that includes culturally significant Asian projects like “Crazy Rich Asians” and “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,” to the kooky sci-fi horror film “M3GAN.” Chieng says he enjoys taking on Asian projects if they’re done “tastefully and respectfully.” But he also acknowledges that many actors of Asian descent fear being pigeonholed into predominantly Asian projects, rather than also being included in other casts. Their careers involve striking a balance.
“Is the Asian American experience about telling people, ‘We’re not Asian, we’re Americans. Stop making us tell Asian stuff.’? Or is it, ‘Hey, we’re Asian American, here’s our culture. This is how we do it in America,’? said Chieng, best known as a standup comedian and senior correspondent on “The Daily Show.” “We’re always battling that.”
But with expanding types of roles available to Asian actors in recent years, Chieng said he respects those who refrain from taking any role offered to them.
“I do understand there’s some really serious Asian American actors out there, who went to Yale School of Drama, who … do hold out,” he said. “I’ve seen them turn down roles. Because they have their own artistic integrity. They’re willing to wait for it. They’re willing to wait for the right role. They don’t want to just take a paycheck.”
As for Chieng, he’s pretty much down for anything that comes his way.
“I’m desperate for work. I’ll do anything, as you can tell from my IMDB page,” Chieng joked. “I will really do any role that pays money or even some that didn’t pay any money.”
There is, however, one gig that Chieng isn’t so sure he’d be interested in: the coveted host spot on “The Daily Show.”
“I love being on the show. I think the show’s great,” he said.  “I think there’s much more qualified people for it.”

2024-03-13T18:15:09.596Z,,NBC News,"ENID, Okla. — The photo of Judd Blevins was unmistakable.
In it, Blevins, bearded and heavyset, held a tiki torch on the University of Virginia campus, on the eve of Unite the Right, a 2017 coming-together of the nation’s neo-Nazi and white supremacist groups.
Connie Vickers had found the photo online along with others showing Blevins marching alongside an angry mob — a crowd of men recorded throughout the night spitting and shouting “Jews will not replace us!” Vickers had it enlarged at a local print and copy shop. On a January night in 2023, she and Nancy Presnall, best friends, retirees and rare Democrats in a deeply red Oklahoma county, brought it to a sparsely attended forum where Blevins, a candidate running to represent Ward 1 on Enid’s six-seat City Council, was making his case.
They had hoped to get a question in while Blevins was on stage, but settled for confronting him after.
Hearts pumping, Presnall and Vickers approached the 41-year-old former Marine. From a kitchen trash bag, Vickers pulled out the blown-up photo of Blevins and asked about his ties to white nationalists.
As his campaign manager whisked a red-faced Blevins away, Vickers and Presnall followed, yelling, “Answer the question, Judd!”
“He ran away from two little old ladies,” Presnall recalled.
Two weeks later, on Valentine’s Day, Blevins won his race, unseating the Republican incumbent, widely viewed as a devoted public servant, who died from cancer later that year. Voters seemed to appreciate Blevins’ bio: a veteran who’d served in Iraq and who’d worked a manual job in Tulsa before moving back to his hometown to take over his father’s roofing business. Blevins described himself as a man of God and extolled the city as a place where “traditional values” remained the norm.
The message resounded in Enid, a city nearly 100 miles north of Oklahoma City with just over 50,000 people. In 1980, more than 90% of the area's residents were white; now less than 3 in 4 are. Enid is both one of the country’s most quickly diversifying places and one of the most conservative, where residents describe the ever-present whirring of jets from nearby Vance Air Force Base as “the sound of freedom.”
It’s not clear how many voters knew about Blevins’ white nationalist ties. There was an article in the local paper, which Blevins labeled “a hit piece,” but beyond the confrontation with Vickers and Presnall, it just wasn’t talked about. Blevins wasn’t asked about it at campaign events or forums and his opponent never brought it up.
But a white nationalist campaigning for office is one thing; his election is another. And Blevins’ win didn’t sit well with many in Enid. It marked the beginning of a fight to expel Blevins from the City Council — a fight for the very soul of Enid that would unite a coalition of its most progressive residents, divide its conservatives and show the power of community organizing.
Over the next year, grandmothers would be branded antifa radicals, local organizers would be accused of attempted murder, and a national white power movement would stake its claim on the City Council. And for a growing number of state and local governments confronting extremism in their ranks, the outcome of that fight — Blevins’ recall election on April 2 — will serve either as a model or a warning.
Blevins has declined multiple interview requests. (In response to questions about his white nationalist ties, he told a reporter, “I hope you find God.”) So when, how and why Blevins got involved with a white supremacist movement may never be known.
What is clear is that from at least 2017 to 2019, Blevins was an active leader in Identity Evropa, one of the largest among the white nationalist and neo-Nazi groups that collectively made up the alt-right.
In public, Identity Evropa eschewed the racist label, opting instead for sanitized descriptors like “identitarians” who were focused on “preserving Western culture.” But privately, in secret meetings and internal online chat groups, members were clear about their motivations and beliefs. In posts that praised Nazis, denigrated racial minorities and professed the superiority of white people, pseudonymous Identity Evropa members spoke candidly about their goal of normalizing racist ideologies and infiltrating conservative politics.
As the group’s Oklahoma state coordinator, Blevins flyered its major cities and universities with his group’s white nationalist propaganda, organized and participated in banner drops over state highways, and recruited, interviewed and accepted new members into the fold. Blevins marched at the tiki torch rally alongside hundreds of men in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017 and the next day at Unite the Right, where he carried the original Oklahoma flag.
Blevins remained active in the group even after the rally ended in violence, with beatings of counterprotesters and the murder of a 32-year-old paralegal and civil rights activist. In a 2018 podcast, Blevins, who went by the online moniker Conway, talked about his passion for recruitment.
“As we like to say in Identity Evropa, there’s nothing you can do to stop us,” Blevins said.
Most of this was reported by left-wing news outlets three years before Blevins ran for office.
In March 2019, Unicorn Riot, a progressive media collective that covers social movements, published Identity Evropa’s private chats, which anti-fascist researchers and journalists then used to identify people who planned and attended the Charlottesville rally: police, teachers and members of the military among them. One group matched Conway to Blevins based on photos, biographical details and Conway’s disclosure that he would be marching at Unite the Right with Oklahoma’s original flag. The progressive news outlet Right Wing Watch published an article soon after outing Blevins to a wider audience. NBC News verified this reporting and unearthed more evidence of Blevins’ white supremacist identity, including posts, photos and a podcast appearance.
After his unmasking, which included antifa activists posting photos of his family and the Tulsa lawn-care business where he worked, Blevins shut down his social media accounts.
In one of his final messages in the Identity Evropa internal chat, he said he was moving back home, and, in one of his last tweets, he hinted at wider ambitions.
Under another pseudonym, Blevins posted that “our guys” — meaning fellow white nationalists — should be supported in pursuing local elected office “such as city council.”
“Basically positions where one can fly under the radar yet still be effective,” Blevins posted.
Back in Enid, Blevins kept a low profile, fixing roofs for his dad’s company. In 2022 he announced his candidacy, and it didn’t take long for the local newspaper to get wind of Blevins’ past.
The Enid News & Eagle doesn’t wade into controversy often — aside from its endorsement of Hillary Clinton in 2016, a gut punch to the city’s conservatives that led to a flood of canceled subscriptions. Most stories are of government meetings, high school sports and features about local heroes and businesses. Cindy Allen, a former editor and publisher, and a conservative Republican herself, knew people in Enid would be suspicious of the left-wing outlets that first reported on Blevins, so over five weeks, she and a reporter retraced Right Wing Watch’s steps and then published a front-page exposé.
It’s unclear how many people in Enid read the article. “Let’s be honest,” Allen said. “The readership of newspapers is a lot lower than it used to be.”
Blevins declined to be interviewed, but gave the paper a statement alleging that leftists backed by a “George-Soros-funded” media outlet were behind a campaign to brand him a Nazi.
Around the same time, Connie Vickers was conducting her own investigation. She pored over Blevins’ old posts, collecting the ones where he mentioned Hitler admiringly and joked about wearing a swastika armband. Vickers scoured news footage from Charlottesville for Blevins. She collected screenshots and forwarded them to her friend Nancy Presnall. She made her sign. Armed with that evidence, representing the Garfield County Democrats, Presnall began speaking at City Council meetings. At a meeting in January 2023, a week before the candidates’ forum, she warned about Blevins’ candidacy and support, calling it “an underlying evil that is coming into our town.”
Blevins won by 36 votes in an election where 808 people, less than 15% of the ward’s 5,600 registered voters, came out — a dismal turnout on par with municipal elections across the country.
The credit — or the blame — for Blevins’ victory depends on whom you ask. Some say it was name recognition; Blevins shares a last name, but is no relation, to the beloved owners of the only locally operated grocery store, Jumbo Foods. Most credit a local conservative activist who managed his campaign and his supporters from the Enid Freedom Fighters, a Facebook group-turned-political force that warred against mask mandates and then certain library books. Blevins’ campaign materials, which leaned into this hard-right Republican identity, were unprecedented in an Enid City Council election — which had always been nonpartisan.
Blevins’ win represented the kind of quiet progress white power groups had been preaching. As the alt-right splintered after Charlottesville, leaders urged their members to log off the internet, remove their masks and get involved in the political establishment.
“The Republican Party is comprised largely of white, aging baby boomers,” white supremacist James Allsup told Identity Evropa conferencegoers in 2018. “As baby boomers age out, the positions they hold will become vacant all throughout society and somebody will have to fill them.”
Most of the avowed white supremacists who ran for office in 2018 lost. Increasingly, though, far-right activists and extremists, including those espousing white supremacist beliefs, are faring better. In 2022, the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism identified more than 100 right-wing extremists running for office nationwide. Nineteen won.
The fallout from these local elections has rocked communities from Florida to Idaho. Christian nationalists in Ottawa County, Michigan, pushed out their moderate Republican counterparts in 2023 and took over a county board. The same happened with far-right activists the year before in conservative Shasta County, California.
In Enid, Blevins’ election galvanized an opposition. In March 2023, around 100 people, including Vickers and Presnall, met at a community center. By the end of the evening, they had formed the Enid Social Justice Committee and decided on its first order of business: recalling Judd Blevins.
The group elected a chair and a vice: Kristi Balden, a 58-year-old mother of three, easily spotted in Enid with her pink hair and white cowboy boots, and James Neal, 48, priest of a small inclusive Orthodox Catholic parish and local firebrand known for his flowing garments and embrace of the LGBTQ community.
They created a Facebook page and urged followers to sign an online petition. They launched a website that laid out the evidence against Blevins. They made buttons and T-shirts emblazoned with images of raised fists, and hosted grill-outs, bake sales and protests.
When former state Sen. Jake Merrick hosted Blevins on his Freedom 96.9 talk radio show in March, he noted Blevins was “under attack.”
“They would like to see me apologize and denounce everything that I’m accused of, but I don’t have anything to apologize for,” Blevins said.
On May 1, two-and-a-half months after he was elected, Blevins was sworn in at City Hall. Dozens of Enid Social Justice Committee (ESJC) members gathered outside, holding signs that read, “What happened in Charlottesville, Judd?” and chanted a riff on the hateful Unite the Right cry, “Judd, we will replace you!”
That would take time. Per Enid law, a city commissioner must serve six months before a recall petition can be filed. In the meantime, the ESJC spoke at nearly every City Council meeting. The last item on the agenda — after prayer, the pledge and a plea from the local animal shelter to adopt a pet in need, after the council addressed the mundane but essential tasks required of local governments, which recently included the reprogramming of traffic lights and a law designating size limits for pet pot-bellied pigs — is public comment. ESJC was such a constant presence that the mayor changed the time allotted for public comment on nonagenda items from three minutes to one.
Blevins’ record in the council — apart from the chaos — has been mostly without incident. He’s voted with the rest of the council, and attended veteran’s events at the base and store openings.
His hard-right posturing has won Blevins supporters who signed up for public comment to counter the “mob of weirdos and miscreants” at the ESJC and compare Blevins to venerated conservative figures like Ronald Reagan. A woman with a “Let’s Go Brandon” T-shirt beseeched the council to look inside their own hearts and ask whether their pasts included anything they “wouldn’t want known.” Another man with a long ginger beard commended Blevins for his courage in attending the Charlottesville rally, which he called a “demonstration to protect American history.”
Outside the council, too, Enid’s conservatives were rallying.
Wade Burleson, former president of the Southern Baptists of Oklahoma and a retired pastor of Enid’s largest church, was an early supporter of Blevins on Facebook. Burleson, who also sits on the faith advisory committee of the state’s controversial school Superintendent Ryan Walters, said attempts to unseat Blevins are a “race-bait trap,” an attempt by “communists” and the “mainstream media” to “divide the world over race.”
From the office of his new ministry, an old Pizza Hut remodeled by his wife, Burleson explained that Blevins’ time with white nationalism was a response to his service in the Marines and a reaction to the Black Lives Matter movement.
“He made some mistakes,” Burleson said, “but he’s not a racist.”
By the fall, organizers with the Enid Social Justice Committee were knocking on doors in Ward 1, collecting signatures. But committee members agreed they would forgo a recall if Blevins acknowledged his white nationalist activities and associations, renounce them and apologize. Blevins refused.
Behind closed doors, Enid Mayor David Mason said Blevins was more forthcoming.
“He admitted it,” said Mason, an insurance executive who was elected the same time as Blevins. Mason has a way of wearing his exasperation on his face during heated council meetings: he whips off his glasses, breathes in deeply and leans back in his swivel chair. He’s concerned about what Blevins’ ties with hate groups will do for business in a city he’s desperate to grow. “Every time you Google Enid, Oklahoma, that's what comes up,” Mason said.
In a private meeting in November with Blevins, the city manager and the city attorney, Mason asked: “Was that you in Charlottesville? Is that you in those photographs? Did you write all those hateful text messages?”
“Yes,” Blevins said, according to Mason and the city attorney.
“Are you still involved with those groups?” Mason asked.
“I don’t have to answer that question,” Blevins replied.
“My thought,” Mason remembers, was, “You just did.”
Mason couldn’t remove Blevins, but he wanted to do something, so he wrote a measure for the next meeting’s agenda: a censure that would announce the loss of confidence in Blevins and formally repudiate white nationalism.
Meanwhile, Blevins and his supporters went on the offense.
On Nov. 12, Blevins walked into the Enid Police Department and filed a report. The brake line on his silver pickup had been cut, he said, and he offered as suspects two members of the Enid Social Justice Committee, who have denied involvement. He typed up an account of his claims on city letterhead, blaming the attack on “far left wing fringe groups.”
He went back on Jake Merrick’s radio show, where he asked the audience to pray for him and the Enid police as they investigated. Merrick described it as an “attempted murder,” a characterization that Blevins repeated at a future council meeting, in a critique of the media for its lack of coverage: “I guess attempted murder of an elected official isn’t newsworthy!”
Outside of Enid, news of the upcoming censure vote and the alleged attempt on Blevins’ life attracted the attention of Blevins’ other allies: national white supremacist groups.
Jason Kessler, a neo-Nazi and organizer of the Charlottesville rally, and Jared Taylor, a self-described “white advocate” who edits the racist website American Renaissance, came out in support of Blevins. Taylor posted a video praising Blevins as “the perfect man for the job.”
Leaders of the American Freedom Party, a white power group formed by skinheads in Southern California, had been following events in Enid closely. Back when Blevins won, the group celebrated, posting to their Telegram channels that Enid showed the political appetite for white supremacist messaging. (“Join us to run for office under a pro-White banner today!”) Now that Blevins was under threat of censure, the American Freedom Party urged its members to write to the other City Council members asking them to vote no.
One neo-Nazi blogger called the community organizers with ESJC “outrageous antifa commandos.”
The blogger wrote: “Doesn’t it feel like this could and should be used to springboard our guys into a permanent takeover of Enid, Oklahoma?”
The chamber was packed with members of the ESJC and Blevins supporters for the Nov. 21 meeting where the motion to censure Blevins would be decided. Mason, the mayor, was sure he had the votes.
And then Derwin Norwood spoke. Norwood, the owner of a concrete business, a registered Republican and the council’s only Black member, took the floor for eight minutes. In a fiery speech that sounded at times like a sermon, Norwood told of his own experiences with racism and quoted scripture.
“We need to stop this foolishness, stop fighting, stop bickering,” Norwood said.
And then, although Blevins hadn’t directly asked for his forgiveness, Norwood was moved by the Holy Spirit to offer it. He remembers it like an out-of-body experience.
“Stand up,” Norwood told Blevins. “Do you love me?”
“Yes I do, as a brother in Christ,” Blevins replied.
“l forgive you,” Norwood said, and the men embraced to applause and groans.
With that, the votes were gone. The council voted unanimously to table the matter until after the recall election.
No one — not the mayor or Blevins or the ESJC or Norwood himself — had expected the display, photos of which led news coverage and white nationalist websites alike. Norwood knows his voice carries extra weight when the topic is racism, and he knows that his forgiveness, and that hug, might have given cover to Blevins, but he didn’t see any other way.
“A lot of people were mad at me,” Norwood said, sitting in the lobby of Enid’s new, but empty, downtown hotel. “But I’m proud of what I did. I was the example of righteousness.”
Besides, he continued, “Now no one can say that we influenced the election.”
The ESJC collected more than enough signatures and filed its petition to recall Blevins. There was still one hiccup: finding someone to replace him. They discussed supporting a progressive Democrat, but this was no time for delusions — Blevins was already sending out campaign mailers featuring pro-LGBTQ Facebook posts from Balden and Neal, the chair and vice chair, as evidence that any candidate who tried to unseat him would be a tool of the ESJC. At a  City Council meeting in December, Blevins pointed his finger toward Balden and offered a warning.
“I want anybody who’s thinking about filing to understand this. You will be the social justice squad’s candidate,” he said. “You will have to campaign as this candidate in a ward that went for Donald Trump by 80%. So good luck with that.”
In January, Cheryl Patterson, 61, entered the race, a move she told friends was a result of “temporary insanity.” In announcing her campaign, the grandmother, church youth leader, former teacher and longtime Republican asked supporters not to speak negatively about Blevins. “I hope the focus will be on what each candidate has to offer & the positive things happening in Enid!” she wrote on Facebook. In interviews and at fundraisers, Patterson has repeated what’s become her unofficial campaign motto, reminiscent of Warren G. Harding’s 1920 slogan.
“We need civility,” Patterson told the News & Eagle. “Just normalcy.”
Neither Patterson nor her campaign manager responded to interview requests. People close to her said better to keep away from national news. Even offering a comment could be spun by Blevins and his supporters as collusion.
Signs for both Patterson and Blevins dot the lawns of Ward 1. Most people don’t show up to City Council meetings and haven’t been following the Blevins saga. There’s no polling in Enid, but in talking to people, those who plan to vote next month are split on who should win.
Enid Police never announced the results of the investigation into Blevins’ attempted murder claims. But in December, a month after it was opened, the police closed Blevins’ case. Members of the Enid Social Justice Committee were never interviewed. In his final report, obtained through an open records request, the investigating detective wrote that a review of hours of surveillance footage of Blevins’ truck around town showed no evidence of a crime. “The only person around the vehicle at any of the places is Judd,” the report said.
Members of the ESJC said they are aware — if not downright afraid — that Blevins’ allegations put them on the radar of Nazi groups. They’re careful about their meetings now, keeping the location secret until the last minute. On one evening this month, a few dozen members met at Jezebel’s, a tea house and event space with witchy goods like crystals and tarot cards for sale. They talked about what’s next, after they complete the mission that brought them together: a memorial plaque for a local civil rights leader, a scarf drive for Enid’s unhoused and assembling kits for people released from the Garfield County jail.
In the meantime, Balden reminded the group not to campaign for Patterson, to steer clear of Blevins’ accusations that they’re behind her run.
But they’re all holding their breath. Mayor Mason is, too.
“Hate has no place in Enid,” Mason said. “And if he were to win again, I think there will be another recall. I think it will continue until someone will beat him. We’re just not going to — that’s not us. That is not who the people of Enid are.”

2024-03-13T14:06:49.865Z,Migrant holding toddler hit by stun gun and punched repeatedly by police officers at NYC shelter,NBC News,"A Venezuelan migrant holding his toddler was hit by a stun gun and punched in the face by police officers at a New York City migrant shelter in an act caught on video — and defended by the mayor as ""appropriate.""
The video, obtained and published by The New York Times on Tuesday, showed the moment two officers confronted Yanny Cordero, 47, at a city-run shelter in Jamaica, Queens borough, on Friday.
The clip showed two officers pin Cordero against closed elevator doors as he was holding his year-old son.
One officer brought out a yellow stun gun and deployed it on the man, its trilling sound audible. Moments later, that same officer appeared to punch the man in the face.
A woman crying and screaming near Cordero appeared to be pulled away from him after the punch and the child he was holding was also separated from him.
In front of Cordero and the officers were two officers in military garb and several spectators.  The man filming the altercation was heard yelling in Spanish: “This is abuse!""
The two officers struggled to detain Cordero, then tried to pin him against a nearby desk. A third police officer entered the altercation and punched Cordero twice in the face, triggering more yelling and uproar from witnesses.
Three officers ultimately subdued Cordero onto the ground.
The man who filmed the interaction yelled, “Hey they’re hitting him! Hey don’t hit him, don’t hit him, don’t hit him, brother. That’s abuse. Where are the human rights?”
The clip ended with Cordero on the ground with officers around him.
The New York City Police Department said it responded to the shelter late Friday around 11 p.m. over a dispute involving an intoxicated man ""who was threatening staff members.""
Officers gave the Cordero multiple warnings and commands to give the child to someone else and he refused, police said.
However, Cordero told the Times that he hadn’t been drinking because he had to work the next day.
Cordero, who does not speak English, told the Times that the dispute erupted after he returned to the shelter with dinner he purchased outside the shelter. He said a shelter employee seemed to tell him in English that he couldn't take the food up to his room.
He told the Times that he used a translation app on his phone to try to communicate that he was going to eat in the cafeteria when the shelter employee’s colleague was called over and struck him in the face.
Police said the child was unharmed in the incident and the city's Administration for Children’s Services was notified and responded.
Cordero was charged with resisting arrest, disorderly conduct and violent behavior, obstructing government administration and acting in a manner injurious to a child under 17.
His wife Andrea Parrar, 22, who in the clip threw her body between her husband and the officers, was also charged with resisting arrest, disorderly conduct and fighting, and obstructing government administration, police said.
The family was reunited Monday with their children. They were given a new shelter placement in Brooklyn after requesting to be moved, the mayor's office told NBC News.
New York City Mayor Eric Adams, a former police officer himself, said the officers took ""appropriate action"" during an unrelated press conference Tuesday.
“I saw that incident and I spoke with the commissioner over the weekend,"" Adams said. ""Those officers had to get that child from him so that child was not going to be in danger. All of this is on body-worn camera. Those officers responded to a person who was dangerous and took appropriate actions.""
""Domestic incidents are extremely dangerous. These are very volatile situations. Those officers have to respond accordingly. They wanted to get that child out of that gentleman’ hand after warning him several times asking him to turn over the child, he refused to. He was violent, he was volatile, they had to take that necessary action and based on our review, those officers took appropriate action,"" he added.
New York City Hall said the matter is under investigation, but it's not clear which agency is looking into the case.
“We are aware of an incident involving a family in our care at an emergency shelter in Jamaica, Queens Friday night. The health and safety of all migrants and longtime New Yorkers in our care — especially young children — is always a top priority, and this matter is currently under investigation,” City Hall said.

2024-03-13T15:12:34.253Z,Man bitten by crocodile in Florida Everglades says he 'didn't know what was holding' him,NBC News,"A South Florida man has a long road to recovery after he was bitten in the leg by a crocodile at Everglades National Park over the weekend.
""I am feeling good because I am alive,"" Rodrigo Constain told NBC South Florida on Tuesday after coming home from the hospital. ""It’s a story that probably couldn’t be told.""
Constain fell into the water at the Flamingo Marina on Sunday when the wind knocked over his sailboat.
When he tried to get back inside the boat, Constain said he felt something holding onto his leg.
""I didn’t feel any pain, nothing,"" he recalled. ""I don’t know why.""
Constain said his intuition was to touch whatever was holding onto his leg. He then felt a long mouth and a head and tried to loosen the creature’s grip.
""I didn’t know what was holding me because I didn’t enter in panic,"" he said. ""I didn’t know ... never I thought that it was a crocodile.""
The crocodile let go. Constain finally felt the pain hit as he swam back to the deck.
""I wasn’t panicking and I didn't at all. I wasn't afraid, I didn't feel any panic,"" he said.
Rangers responded to the marina and found the 68-year-old with lacerations on his leg. Constain said his wife and the rangers saw the crocodile in the water from the deck.
It's rare for an American crocodile to bite a human, The Associated Press reported. The only other documented case involving a crocodile biting a human happened in 2014, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission spokesperson Lauren Claerbout told the news outlet in an email.
Constain was flown to Jackson South Hospital. He said doctors told him the wound went as deep as the bone, but it was a miracle that there was no fracture.
Doctors said it could take about a month for him to walk again.
""I don't know how I'm gonna work since I’m a handyman,"" Constain said.
His family established a GoFundMe for help with hospital bills. He said he’s thankful for the help he’s received so far.
""There’s only one reason that I'm here: It's God,"" Constain said. ""If you’re not with God, I wouldn't be here. He was all the time with me and that's what I think. I was not afraid, because when you believe in God, you are not afraid.""

2024-03-12T11:47:37.332Z,"Inside the organized crime rings plaguing Ulta, T.J. Maxx, Walgreens and other retailers",NBC News,"In a tony suburban enclave in the San Diego foothills, police say, an organized retail crime “queenpin” had built an empire.
Tucked behind the stone walls of her 4,500-square-foot Spanish-style mansion, Michelle Mack had stockpiled a small fortune in cosmetics that had been stolen from Ulta and Sephora stores across the country, authorities said.
Police don’t suspect that Mack, 53, took the items herself. Instead, they say, she pulled the strings from the shadows, employing a network of around a dozen women who stole the items for her so she could resell them on AmazonWith their airfare, car rentals and other travel expenses paid by Mack, the suspects committed hundreds of thefts up and down the California coast and into Washington, Utah, Oregon, Colorado, Arizona, Illinois, Texas, Florida, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and Ohio, investigators said. Mack selected which stores to target and what merchandise to take and the women were sent to clear out entire shelves of merchandise before making off with the stolen goods stuffed into Louis Vuitton bags, investigators said.
Investigators began referring to the theft group as the “California Girls” and considered Mack the crew’s ringleader. She made millions reselling the stolen items on Amazon to unwitting customers at a fraction of their typical retail price, investigators said, before she was arrested in early December.
Law enforcement officials say Mack’s alleged theft ring is just one of the many that are plaguing U.S. retailers and costing them billions in losses annually. Their rise has led many companies to lock up merchandise, hire security guards and lobby lawmakers for stricter regulations.
These organized theft groups don’t typically carry out the splashy “smash and grab” robberies seen in viral videos. Instead, they pilfer goods quickly, quietly and efficiently. They often function within elaborate, organized structures that in some ways mimic the corporations they’re stealing from, police said.
CNBC has spent about eight months embedding with various law enforcement agencies and investigating theft groups to understand what organized retail crime looks like from the ground. In some cases, CNBC witnessed low-level shoplifting incidents involving people who appeared to be homeless or mentally ill. In other instances, CNBC saw takedowns of alleged organized theft groups that police said were reselling stolen merchandise at flea markets. Mack’s group, from her alleged network of professional thieves to her lucrative Amazon marketplace, was by far the most sophisticated one CNBC tracked alongside police.
But federal agents with Homeland Security Investigations, the Department of Homeland Security’s law enforcement branch, said some crime groups are even more elaborate — and theft is just one facet of their enterprises.
“We’re talking about operations that have fleets of trucks, 18-wheelers that have palletized loads of stolen goods, that have cleaning crews that actually clean the goods to make them look brand new,” said Adam Parks, an assistant special agent in charge at HSI, which is the main federal agency investigating retail crime.
“Just like any business, they’ve invested their capital into business assets like shrink wrap machines, forklifts,” Parks, who works out of HSI’s Baton Rouge, Louisiana, office, told CNBC in an interview. “That is what organized theft looks like, and it actually is indistinguishable from other e-commerce distribution centers.”
These theft groups in their myriad forms have become a thorn in the side of retailers big and small, prompting retailers to cite crime as the reason for lower profits, the inability to hire and retain staff, and the degradation of the in-store experience. They have also united politically divided Americans in their disdain for seeing everyday products locked up behind glass cases and witnessing brazen theft gone unchecked in stores.
Whether organized retail crime is actually rising is up for debate. Retailers including Target, Foot Locker, Walgreens and Ulta have said theft is a growing problem in recent years. But few have said how often it’s happening or how much money they’re losing from it, fueling accusations from some experts and analysts that they’re blaming crime in order to mask operational missteps.
The National Retail Federation estimates that retailers lost $40.5 billion to external theft, including organized retail crime, in 2022. That represented about 36% of total inventory losses — slightly lower than the 37% in 2021.
Even if theft has not meaningfully reduced some retailers’ profits, many have warned that crime can threaten the safety of workers and shoppers.
“The financial impact is real, but way more important is the human impact, the impact it has to our associates, the impact it has to our guests,” Ulta CEO Dave Kimbell told CNBC in a rare sit-down interview.
“It also impacts the communities in which we live,” he said. “If people don’t feel safe going in to shop in certain areas of a community, it really has an impact and can change neighborhoods and change communities over time.”
The government response to the issue has grown in turn. Both local and federal agencies have stepped up enforcement of laws targeting organized retail crime, and lawmakers are proposing and passing more measures that stiffen penalties for theft offenses.
HSI initiated 59 cases against organized theft groups in fiscal 2021, resulting in 55 indictments and 61 arrests, the agency said.
By the end of fiscal 2023, cases had more than tripled, to 199. Indictments spiked more than fivefold to 284, while arrests soared to 386, more than six times the number in 2021.
California Highway Patrol, which runs one of the most active retail crime task forces in the country, reports it made 170% more arrests for organized theft offenses in 2023 than it did in 2022.
It’s not clear whether organized theft offenses increased in that time or officials ramped up enforcement as the issue got more public attention and the retail industry’s lobbying engine pressed them to make it a priority.
CNBC embedded with teams from HSI and California Highway Patrol to witness four organized retail crime operations for this investigation. The probe is also based on more than a dozen interviews with law enforcement officers, retail leaders and customers, along with records, including court filings, company reports and property records.
On a sweltering Monday morning in July, about a dozen agents from HSI New Orleans gathered behind the U.S. Custom House, preparing for Operation French Quarter.
The officers were instructed to pose as shoppers inside three Walgreens stores and one CVS store in the area seeing high rates of theft, sometimes as many as 20 to 30 incidents per day, agents said.
As federal law enforcement agents who typically investigate terrorism, sex trafficking and gang leaders such as Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman, the officers weren’t there to arrest people for petty theft. They had a clear directive: Find out who’s stealing and follow them out of the store to determine who else they may be working with.
“Obviously, the name of the game, guys and girls, is trying to get the bigger and better fish,” Assistant Special Agent in Charge Scott Robles, who led the operation, told the assembled officers. “We’re trying to identify the people who are in charge of this organized crime.”
At the bottom of organized retail crime rings are boosters — the people who go into stores and take the items. Robles was hoping the serial thieves targeting the drugstores could lead them to a larger operation.
“It can be anybody. It could be the mom with five kids just looking for extra money. It can be somebody that’s part of a team. ... They may be getting paid with food, they may be getting paid with beer or drugs,” Robles said. “Some people get paid cash or they’re trying to work off a debt.”
Throughout the hourslong operation, agents identified at least one case that they say plainly showed organized theft.
Surveillance footage of the incident shows a man enter one of the Walgreens stores, head to the cosmetics aisle, remove a plastic shopping bag from his pants and calmly load it up with 17 jars of nail polish, valued at around $200. He then walked about a half mile away to the New Orleans Public Library’s main branch, where he sold the nail polish to a security guard, police said.
Federal agents briefly questioned the security guard, and the incident remains under investigation.
Beyond that instance, the vast majority of the thefts agents witnessed during the operation were low-level and petty, involving people who appeared to be homeless, mentally ill or transient. One man stole paper towels and then walked into a homeless shelter. A group took a case of beer and later went to a park to drink it. A woman stole a case of water, set up a stand to resell it and then defecated on the sidewalk.
Operation French Quarter showed how the lowest level of a retail crime operation can function, and how even small thefts can involve coordination among bad actors. Still, the incidents underscore the challenges investigators face when trying to build cases; they also demonstrate just how petty many thefts are, especially in urban areas with high rates of homelessness and addiction.
A Walgreens spokesperson told CNBC that the chain is “focused on the safety of our patients, customers and team members” and is taking steps to “safely deter theft” and “deliver the best patient and customer experience.”
“We are working closely with law enforcement, elected officials and community leaders to draw greater attention to and improve our response to retail crime,” the spokesperson said.
Crates filled with unopened jugs of Gain, Tide and Downy detergent. Boxes stuffed with Gillette razors, Olay moisturizer and Allegra allergy pills. A pile of sparkly silver boots in sizes 8, 9 and 10 with the T.J. Maxx tags still on.
This is just some of the merchandise that California Highway Patrol found inside a home and storage container belonging to suspected members of an organized retail crime ring during a raid in November.
In all, investigators uncovered nearly 20,000 items valued at more than $550,000 across five locations connected with the group, according to CHP. Police suspect the majority of the items were stolen from T.J. Maxx stores and a variety of drugstores and grocery stores in and around the Bay Area.
CHP’s probe began in September, when investigators from TJX Companies, the owner of T.J. Maxx, reached out to the agency’s organized retail crime task force with information about a crime ring that it said was buying and reselling stolen goods — a “fencing” operation.
When boosters need to cash in on the items they take, they turn to fencers, who buy the products for pennies on the dollar and resell them at a margin Wall Street could only dream of, retail crime investigators have said.
Experts said retailers can have a hard time persuading law enforcement to investigate theft at stores because it is often considered a property crime, which police tend to see as less urgent than homicides, shootings and narcotics crimes.
To show law enforcement the scope of the problem, TJX investigators began conducting surveillance on the alleged crime ring. CHP agreed to take the case. Sgt. Manny Nevarez, who oversees all organized retail crime investigations in the Bay Area for CHP, told CNBC the group had hit stores in multiple counties in an effort to evade detection.
“They are not catching on that some of the retailers have their own loss prevention personnel and typically, if you target one store in San Jose, then the word gets out and then the next store is notified,” said Nevarez.
Police learned that alleged members of the group were reselling the suspected stolen merchandise out of their homes and at the local Capitol Flea Market — a sprawling swap meet on the outskirts of San Jose. Officers also witnessed members of the crew receiving suspected stolen merchandise, transferring those goods to others in their network and exchanging money.
At the end of November, dozens of CHP investigators working with TJX descended on the five locations connected with the alleged fencing ring and carried out search warrants in a raid cops dubbed “Operation Kingsfall.” The locations included numerous homes along with a storage unit.
“Nosotros somos policia,” the officers shouted in Spanish outside one of the homes. “Police, search warrant. Open the door with your hands up,” they continued, switching between English and Spanish before using a battering ram to knock down the door.
The location, an innocuous single-family home with Christmas decorations out front, looked like any other on the block. But on the sidewalk and grass near the property line sat dozens of discarded clothing tags, anti-theft devices, hangers and other retail store detritus.
Inside the home, CHP officers and TJX personnel found mountains of goods they suspect were stolen to resell, including bags of apparel with the tags still affixed, boxes of Huggies diapers, liquor and power tools.
By the time authorities completed the raids, they had enough suspected stolen merchandise to fill three 20-foot-long U-Haul trucks. A spokesperson for the Santa Clara County District Attorney said it is charging nine defendants in connection with the alleged crime ring.
The law enforcement operation witnessed by CNBC showed the breadth of some of the fencing rings in the U.S. and how flea markets can play a role in the sale of stolen goods. Capitol Flea Market didn’t respond to a request for comment.
“There’s certain crimes that come up where the public reaches a point where they’re like, ‘We have had enough of this,’ right?” Lt. Michael Ball, who helped oversee the operation, told CNBC. “And this is one of those that’s reached that level where people are saying widely and shouting it all the way up to our governor’s office that they have had enough of this.”
In a statement, a TJX spokesperson said the company is “thankful” for CHP’s efforts and is taking organized retail crime “very seriously.” The spokesperson said TJX is “laser-focused on ways to mitigate theft in our stores.”
The company told CNBC it will not resell the recovered merchandise. If TJX considers the items to be in suitable condition, it will donate them to charities in the area where they were found, the company said. If it deems the products unsuitable, it will work to dispose of them “responsibly,” it said.
When Donna Washburn started shopping for a Christmas gift for her daughter in December, she wanted to “splurge” and buy her a bottle of Nars foundation. But she couldn’t find it in stock at a store close to home.
So, like many consumers, she Googled the product. She saw it was available on Amazon and cost around $38 before tax, nearly 30% cheaper than its typical retail price of $52.
“I said, you know, ‘It’s Amazon, it’ll come fast.’ It was the beginning of December. So I really didn’t want to wait too much longer for Christmas,” Washburn told CNBC in an interview, adding she was told it would arrive by Dec. 11.
Unknown to Washburn, police say, that bottle of foundation had likely been stolen by the crew of boosters allegedly employed by Mack — the suspected retail crime mastermind accused of running an illicit business from her San Diego mansion.
The Christmas gift ultimately never arrived, because Mack was arrested before she could ship the package, which was one of many found in Mack’s residence by investigators.
“I pay attention, but not that much, you know?” said Washburn, a 63-year-old clinical education associate in St. Augustine, Florida. “I’m shopping from Amazon. Hopefully you can trust it. So now that we know better ... we’ll think twice.”
Washburn had bought the foundation from an Amazon storefront dubbed Online Makeup Store, which Mack had opened in 2012. CNBC viewed it before it was taken down in late 2023.
On its face, Mack’s storefront looked no different from the millions of others on Amazon’s marketplace. It had 4.5 stars on more than 100 reviews, and featured cosmetics from popular brands such as Mac, Tarte and Charlotte Tilbury that shoppers can find in neighborhood beauty stores.
There was just one red flag: the prices. Many of the products for sale at Mack’s store were listed at a fraction of the typical retail price, including a $25 bottle of Estee Lauder foundation that typically retails for $52 and Too Faced mascara that typically goes for $29 and was being sold for $17.
The store brought in millions. Since 2012, Mack sold nearly $8 million in cosmetics through the storefront before it was shut down, and she brought in $1.89 million in 2022 alone, Amazon sales records provided to investigators show.
Mack could offer such low prices, police suspect, because her crew of boosters had stolen the products in hundreds of incidents over more than a decade. Some of the thefts brought in around $2,000 in merchandise while others netted as much as $50,000 worth of merchandise, prosecutors said.
Mack’s business was humming along ahead of the holiday shopping season until the carefully crafted empire police say she built crumbled. On a cool December morning just before dawn, a convoy of CHP and HSI agents, armed with a search warrant, raided her sprawling mansion.
Mack, dressed in a baby pink pajama set and a pair of fuzzy mule slippers, was handcuffed and put into a police car as her teenage daughters stood in the driveway, watching.
Inside her garage, investigators found what they described as a “mini-store” — shelves and shelves of beauty products, sunglasses and designer bags organized in neat bins and categorized by product. They also found hundreds of postmarked yellow envelopes destined for unwitting customers, including Washburn, with “Online Makeup Store” marked as the return address.
Police recovered nearly 10,000 items worth a total of more than $387,000, CHP said.
In February, California Attorney General Rob Bonta filed a total of 140 felony charges against Mack; her husband, Kenneth Mack; and seven other alleged members of the crew. The charges included conspiracy to commit organized retail theft, grand theft and receipt of stolen property. The defendants have all pleaded not guilty. CNBC contacted each defendant multiple times for comment, but none of them responded.
“This is a multimillion-dollar criminal scheme. It was complex. It was orchestrated,” Bonta said when announcing the charges. “We are not talking about garden-variety shoplifting.”
Court records filed in connection with the case provide a rare glimpse into the inner workings of an alleged organized retail crime ring. They show text messages between the suspects and details about the operation.
“I’m not stealing regular I’m going to start filling up my bag quick. So I want to know stuff I can grab in bulks too,” Kimora Lee Gooding texted Michelle Mack on Jan. 7, 2023.
Between Jan. 30 and Feb. 16, 2023, Gooding committed at least 10 separate thefts at Ulta stores across California, prosecutors allege in court records. In each case, Gooding took more than $950 worth of goods, the records say.
On Feb. 21, a few days after Gooding’s string of thefts, Mack sent her a screenshot of “Online Makeup Store” with an address she could ship the stolen products to. It was the same business address that was listed on Mack’s Amazon page before it was shut down, and traced back to a post office box a few miles from her home.
“Even without lancome we still did well,” Michelle Mack texted her husband two days later, allegedly referencing a prestige cosmetics brand owned by L’Oreal.
Soon, orders were pouring into Michelle Mack’s Amazon store.
“Lots of orders let’s get shipping,” Kenneth Mack texted Michelle Mack alongside an image that showed a bin full of paper.
By July 8, it appeared that the haul Gooding and others had allegedly brought in had dried up. Michelle Mack needed more things to sell.
“Did you get some new girls?” Michelle Mack texted Alina Franco, another person charged in connection with the theft crew. “I really need product so if you have anything please let me know.”
A day later, two more thefts connected to the ring were committed and many more followed, prosecutors said.
In addition to Ulta and Sephora, the theft organization targeted a range of other retailers, including Macy’s-owned Bloomingdale’s, Prada, Bath & Body Works, Victoria’s Secret, and Luxottica’s Sunglass Hut and LensCrafters, prosecutors said.
Sephora and Bath & Body Works declined to discuss the case with CNBC. Victoria’s Secret, Macy’s, Prada, Sunglass Hut and LensCrafters didn’t respond to requests for comment.
Despite the recent surge of headlines and commentary on the topic, organized theft groups have long operated around the world. But retail industry leaders and some law enforcement officials argue the rise of online marketplaces and e-commerce has caused such incidents to increase or have made it easier for theft groups to operate.
“There’s an ease of distribution that has become even more prevalent for stolen goods through online marketplaces. ... You used to have to sell stolen goods at flea markets or out of the trunk of your car or maybe just locally,” said Ulta’s Kimbell. “Now, you have more sophisticated tools to have a broader reach across the country or even internationally.”
While Kimbell didn’t name Amazon specifically, he said online marketplaces are “part of the problem” and should be using the data, analytics and other technology available to them to be more “proactive” in shutting down bad-actor sellers.
“We shouldn’t have an environment where it’s possible to steal from one retailer and [have it] end up on any other platform, any other large-scale, mainstream platform” that people consider legitimate, said Kimbell.
Bonta called on Amazon and other marketplaces to “do more.” He said they could inform law enforcement, or at least talk to a seller, when red flags such as unusually cheap goods pop up.
“If you freeze out the demand and remove the market by closing out the marketplace where the stolen goods are so easily sold, you make organized retail crime as an organized crime less attractive. And we need to create barriers, instead of ease, for the ability to commit these crimes,” Bonta said in an interview.
In response, an Amazon spokesperson said that the company has “zero tolerance for the sale of stolen goods” and that the company invests more than $1 billion annually in preventing fraud and abuse.
“We leverage sophisticated detection and prevention solutions across our stores and fulfillment operations, allowing us to quickly spot a range of organized retail crime (ORC) schemes,” the spokesperson said in a statement.
The spokesperson said Amazon supports efforts to trace items throughout the supply chain and investigates allegations of stolen merchandise to find out how products were obtained.
“When we identify an issue, we work closely with law enforcement, retailers, and brands to stop bad actors and hold them accountable, including withholding funds, terminating accounts, and making law enforcement referrals,” which have led to arrests, product seizures and the disruption of retail crime rings, the spokesperson wrote.
The company said it assisted with the investigation into Michelle Mack’s alleged theft crew and provided evidence to investigators. It said it’s “pleased” the suspects were arrested because it “sends a strong message that the sale of stolen goods has severe consequences.”
Consumers, many of whom are hungry for deals as they contend with lingering inflation and high interest rates, may feel that buying stolen goods is a victimless crime, experts say.
Michael Krol, HSI’s special agent in charge, disagrees with that idea. He said not only does theft lead to higher prices for consumers but also the items they’re buying could be unsafe because of how they were stored or otherwise manipulated.
“Those items might not have the quality assurance and compliance that we expect in the United States. Baby formula, your medicines ... [Consumers] could be buying baby formula that’s expired by three months,” said Krol.
The Inform Consumers Act, which took effect in June, was designed to curb the sale of stolen, counterfeit or otherwise harmful products on online platforms by requiring marketplaces to verify and share identifying information on certain third-party sellers.
The law was designed to prevent the exact type of illicit business Michelle Mack is accused of conducting on Amazon. If sellers are required to provide their contact information to marketplaces and on their listings, bad actors may be deterred from selling illicit goods.
However, Michelle Mack’s business name and an address belonging to it had been verified and was publicly available on her seller’s page. She’d already been on the platform for more than a decade by the time the Inform Act rolled around.
The verification process that Amazon conducted for Michelle Mack’s store after the Inform Act passed wasn’t enough to raise the company’s suspicions, either.
“In this instance, we did not receive signals to identify the seller was engaged in selling stolen goods,” Amazon said.
As part of the law, marketplaces are also required to provide a way for people to report suspicious product listings. But the law doesn’t require the marketplaces to do anything with that information.
“Amazon works hard to ensure our store is a safe and trusted place for shoppers,” Amazon says on a page where people can report suspicious listings. “If you believe any product, seller or other activity in our store is suspicious, please report this using one of the below methods.”
“While we are not able to respond directly to each report,” it says, “we appreciate your feedback.”

2024-03-12T21:52:06.010Z,Boeing whistleblower who warned of aircraft safety flaws is found dead,NBC News,"A former Boeing quality inspector who filed a whistleblower complaint over alleged plane safety flaws was found dead “from what appears to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound,” officials in Charleston, South Carolina, said Monday.
John Barnett, 62, of Louisiana, who spent more than three decades at the aircraft manufacturing giant, sounded the alarm with aviation authorities in 2017 about what he said were potentially “catastrophic” safety failings.
His family said in a statement Monday that he had tried to highlight serious concerns but was met with “a culture of concealment” that valued “profits over safety.”
Charleston County Coroner Bobbi Jo O’Neal said in a statement Monday that Barnett died “from what appears to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound” in the city Saturday.
Barnett was in town to testify in a deposition in his federal legal action against Boeing, with his case set to go before an administrative law judge later this year, according to his attorneys.
""He was in very good spirits and really looking forward to putting this phase of his life behind him and moving on,"" the attorneys, Brian Knowles and Robert Turkewitz, said in a joint statement Tuesday. ""We didn’t see any indication he would take his own life. No one can believe it.""
They urged local police to keep investigating despite the coroner’s initial ruling.
""We are all devastated,"" the attorneys said. ""We need more information about what happened to John. The Charleston police need to investigate this fully and accurately and tell the public what they find out. No detail can be left unturned.""
A Charleston police spokesperson, Sgt. Anthony Gibson, said in a statement Monday that the police department had “not received any indication from the coroner’s office that foul play is suspected in this case.”
In a later statement, he pointed to the coroner’s preliminary findings and said detectives “are actively investigating this case and are awaiting the formal cause of death, along with any additional findings that might shed further light on the circumstances surrounding the death of Mr. Barnett.”
The statement from Barnett's family said that he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety attacks and that the “hostile work environment at Boeing” led to his death.
In a statement Monday, ​Boeing said: ​​""We are saddened by Mr. Barnett’s passing, and our thoughts are with his family and friends.” Boeing did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the allegations in the family’s statement.
Barnett, known as Mitch to his family and “Swampy” to his friends, had worked at Boeing’s 787 plant in Charleston since 2010, his family said.
In 2019, The New York Times interviewed several former Boeing employees about their safety concerns. Barnett told the paper that metal shavings — created when metal fasteners are screwed into nuts — could cut wiring that connects the flight controls.
The Federal Aviation Administration ordered Boeing to clear the shavings from the Dreamliners in 2017. Boeing said then that it was following the ruling and would look to improve the design of the nut, but it also said it wasn’t a flight safety issue.
But Barnett told the Times: “I haven’t seen a plane out of Charleston yet that I’d put my name on saying it’s safe and airworthy.”
After he retired in 2017, Barnett filed a whistleblower complaint with federal regulators about his experiences at the South Carolina plant. He also launched a separate legal action against Boeing, accusing it of denigrating his character and hampering his career. Boeing denied the allegations.
His case was up for trial in June, the family statement said, adding: “He was looking forward to having his day in court and hoped that it would force Boeing to change its culture.”
The status of the case was not immediately clear Tuesday.
While Barnett loved his work for most of his career, in Charleston “he learned that upper management was pressuring the quality inspectors and managers to cut corners” and not to follow legally required safety processes, the statement said.
He alleged that staff members were pressured not to document defects because it would slow down the assembly line, it added.
“John told us that every day was a battle to get management to do the right thing,” the family said. The statement added that Barnett and others who highlighted problems were labeled as “trouble-makers,” whereas previously the company had rewarded those who discovered defects.
“It caused John so much stress that his doctor told him that if he stayed, he would have a heart attack,” the family said.
An obituary shared by his family said, “Mitch was fun-loving, and totally devoted to family, especially his nieces and nephews and great nieces and nephews.”
It added that he is survived by his mother, Vicky Melder Stokes; three brothers, Mike Barnett, Robbie Barnett and Rodney Barnett; eight nieces and nephews; and 11 great-nieces and nephews.
Boeing faces regulatory and public scrutiny over a series of incidents involving its planes.
The Justice Department opened an investigation after a door plug blew out on an Alaska Airlines flight in January, which led to the temporary grounding of some Boeing 737 Max 9 airplanes. They have since returned to the air.
And Monday, 50 people were injured on a Boeing Dreamliner plane after a sudden movement midair on a flight from Sydney to Auckland, New Zealand.

2024-03-13T21:59:59.239Z,Death of transgender student Nex Benedict ruled suicide by medical examiner,NBC News,"The death of Oklahoma student Nex Benedict has been ruled a suicide, according to a medical examiner’s report released Wednesday.
The 16-year-old, who was transgender and used he and they pronouns, according to friends and family, died Feb. 8, a day after a fight at Owasso High School. His name has become a rallying cry among LGBTQ activists, who argue that an onslaught of legislation targeting the community has made schools less safe for queer and trans students like Nex.
Nex had reportedly told his mother that he faced bullying at school due to his gender identity, and body-camera footage released last month by police from the hours after the school fight shows Nex lying in a hospital bed. In the video, he tells a police officer how three students “jumped” him after he threw water on them because they were bullying him and his friend for the way they dressed.
The Owasso Police Department released preliminary information from an autopsy report on Feb. 21 that they said shows Nex’s death was not the result of trauma. Days later, a spokesperson for the department clarified that the fight had not been ruled out as having contributed to or caused his death.
The medical examiner’s report listed probable cause of death as “combined toxicity” from two drugs, one of which is available over the counter and the other by prescription.
In a statement posted on its Facebook account Wednesday, following the release of the medical examiner’s report, the Owasso Police Department wrote, in part: “From the beginning of this investigation, Owasso Police observed many indications that this death was the result of suicide. However, investigators did not wish to confirm that information without the final results being presented by the Oklahoma Medical Examiner’s Office.”
Margaret Coates, the superintendent for Owasso Public Schools, acknowledged Nex's cause of death on Wednesday and encouraged students struggling with the news to seek school counseling.
""The loss of Nex, a member of the Ram Family and the Owasso community, is devastating,"" Coates wrote in a letter to families and educators that was shared with NBC News. ""We understand that the information released today may bring up additional thoughts, feelings and emotions for students and staff members.""
An attorney for the Benedict family, Jacob Biby, did not respond to a request for comment on the medical examiner’s report.
Owasso High School students organized a walkout on Feb. 26 to protest what they described as a pervasive culture of bullying that often goes unpunished. Kane, one of the organizers of the walkout who asked to go by first name only to protect his privacy, said at the time that students had speculated that Nex may have died by suicide. But, to Kane, who is nonbinary, the key contributing factor to Nex’s death was bullying.
“There’s been bullying issues. This time, the bullying has gone so far that a student has passed,” Kane said ahead of last month’s walkout. “To me, it doesn’t matter if Nex passed from a traumatic brain injury or if they passed from suicide. What matters is the fact that they died after getting bullied, and that is the story for so many other students. I’ve been close to ending it myself because of bullying. It’s not new for so many students.”
LGBTQ advocates and the medical community have long warned that queer youths face disproportionate rates of suicidal ideation.
In a survey conducted in 2022 by The Trevor Project, an LGBTQ youth suicide prevention organization, more than 40% of LGBTQ people age 13-24 said they seriously considered attempting suicide in the previous year, with trans and nonbinary respondents reporting even higher rates. That same survey of approximately 28,000 LGBTQ young people found 14% had attempted suicide within the past year, including 1 in 5 transgender respondents.
Earlier this month, the Department of Education opened an investigation into whether Nex’s high school failed to appropriately respond to sex-based harassment. The investigation was opened after the nation’s largest LGBTQ advocacy group, the Human Rights Campaign, filed a complaint with the department after Nex’s death. A spokesperson for Owasso Public Schools, Brock Crawford, said at the time that the investigation was “not supported by the facts and is without merit.”
Kelley Robinson, the president of the Human Rights Campaign, reiterated Wednesday the organization's call for an investigation into Nex's death.
""Nex was failed by so many and should still be here today,"" she said in a statement. ""We hold their family in our hearts as they grapple with the devastating reality that their beloved child, a teen with a bright future, is no longer making this world a brighter place.""

2024-03-13T17:18:50.657Z,Alabama Republicans target transgender Space Camp employee,NBC News,"Three Republican Alabama officials are expressing concern that a transgender person is employed at Space Camp, an educational program for children held at the U.S. Space & Rocket Center in Huntsville.
One of the lawmakers is calling for the employee to be removed and for the center to “open a safety review to consider the potential harm and damages they have inadvertently caused children.”
The backlash began Saturday after Clay Yarbrough, a father who lives just outside of Huntsville in the small town of Owens Cross Roads, posted a screenshot of the LinkedIn profile and social media photos of a crew trainer at Space Camp on Facebook. Yarbrough said he had planned to send his daughter to Space Camp the following week, “but we have just found out that this freak is a team lead and a hall monitor in the girls dorms and at times could be allowed to be alone in the halls at night.”
Yarbrough said in the post that the director of Space Camp confirmed “this was true.” Yarbrough did not allege in his post that the employee had committed misconduct but said he wanted his post “to spread.”
Yarbrough’s post was then shared on Facebook and X by Libs of TikTok, a far-right social media account that criticizes LGBTQ teachers and allies, hospitals that provide gender-affirming care to minors and others. An NBC News investigation last month, which Libs of TikTok called a “hit piece,” found 33 instances in which people or institutions that were the subject of posts by Libs of TikTok later reported being the target of bomb threats or other violent intimidation.
Libs of TikTok alleged in its post on X that the Space Camp employee had a history of “inappropriate Twitter posts,” with screenshots of posts about the LGBTQ community that Libs of TikTok alleged were from the employee’s account.
The Space Camp employee declined to comment, though they did confirm they identify as transgender nonbinary and use they/them and she/her pronouns. Yarbrough did not immediately return a request for comment.
In response to a request for comment, Chaya Raichik, who runs Libs of TikTok, shared a screenshot of a post allegedly from the parent of a Space Camp student who said the trans employee was going into the girls’ changing room, among other allegations. Libs of TikTok didn’t share the name of the parent, and NBC News could not independently verify the accusations.
The U.S. Space & Rocket Center — which serves as an official NASA visitor center and is an affiliate of the Smithsonian Institution — did not return a request for comment, but said in a statement to WAFF 48 News, a local TV station in Huntsville, that it is “aware of rumors circulating on social media about a Space Camp employee.”
“We would like to assure parents, teachers, and the public that the safety and security of Space Camp students is our number one priority,” the center said in its statement. “Any allegations of misconduct are taken very seriously. We are working to determine the facts in this case, after which we will take appropriate action.”
The center added that camp staffers undergo extensive nationwide criminal background checks, are not allowed behind closed doors alone with students, and are not allowed to discuss religious topics or politics, among other issues.
On Tuesday, Rep. Dale Strong, an Alabama Republican who represents Huntsville, posted a statement on social media calling on the U.S. Space & Rocket Center to “immediately remove” the employee and to investigate whether the employee might have “inadvertently” caused harm to children.
Sen. Tommy Tuberville and Rep. Robert Aderholt, both Republicans from Alabama, also expressed concern about the situation but stopped short of calling for the center to terminate the employee.
The Alabama Transgender Rights Action Coalition, a trans advocacy group, condemned conservatives’ comments in a statement Monday, noting that Yarbrough “could not name any wrongdoing on the part of the employee, only that they were a transgender person.”
In replies to Yarbrough’s post, the organization said, several other Facebook users “expressed that the presence of queer and transgender employees around Space Camp students is inappropriate in some way, despite presenting no evidence for this.”
The organization added that the goal of the social media posts is to pressure the U.S. Space & Rocket Center into firing the employee simply for being transgender, using decades-old tropes that LGBTQ people are attempting to “indoctrinate” and “groom” children.
“This kind of rhetoric further divides our state, has no basis in reality, and has historically led to violence,” Andrea Trenaman, a member of the Alabama Transgender Rights Action Coalition, said in a statement. “It is additional fuel poured on the flames of moral panic gripping the right wing of American political discourse, based only in fear and misunderstanding.”
A number of state and federal laws protect LGBTQ people from employment discrimination. Most notably, the Supreme Court ruled in 2020 that queer and transgender people are protected from discrimination based on their LGBTQ status under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
So far this year, conservative lawmakers have introduced more than 470 bills targeting LGBTQ people, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. Alabama is considering four such bills, including one that would prohibit instruction or discussions related to gender identity or sexual orientation in public K-12 schools.

2024-03-13T09:00:41.000Z,'Dateline' correspondent Keith Morrison on death of stepson Matthew Perry: 'It's with you every day',NBC News,"Keith Morrison, the veteran “Dateline” correspondent and stepfather of the late actor Matthew Perry, says in a new interview that the “Friends” star felt he was overcoming his yearslong struggles with addiction before he was found unresponsive in his hot tub in late October.
“He felt like he was beating it,” Morrison told “TODAY” show co-anchor Hoda Kotb on an episode of her “Making Spaces” podcast. “But you never beat it, and he knew that, too.”
Morrison said his grief is still raw. “It’s with you every day. It’s with you all the time, and there’s some new aspect of it that assaults your brain,” he said. “It’s not easy.”
Perry, who was open about his experiences with alcoholism and substance misuse, died Oct. 28 at age 54 from the “acute effects” of ketamine, the Los Angeles County medical examiner’s office said in an autopsy report released in December. The report said drowning, coronary artery disease and the effects of buprenorphine, a synthetic opioid, contributed to his death.
The autopsy report said Perry had been “reportedly clean for 19 months.” He was reported to have been using ketamine infusion therapy to help deal with depression and anxiety, according to the findings, and his last treatment was a week and a half before he died.
Morrison, who has been married to Perry’s mother, Suzanne Perry Morrison, since 1981, told Kotb that his stepson “didn’t get to have his third act, and that’s not fair.”
Perry was beloved by generations of television viewers for his role as the smart-aleck accountant Chandler Bing on the NBC sitcom “Friends.” In late 2022, Perry published a memoir, “Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing,” which chronicled his upbringing in Canada, as well as his rise to fame, addiction challenges and recovery.
Morrison said Perry and his mother were closer than they had been in decades when he died. They were “texting each other constantly,” and he shared “things with her that most middle-aged men don’t share with their mothers.” (Perry’s mother, who was a press secretary for the late Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, divorced his biological father when Perry was young.)
Morrison said he can still feel “the echo” of Perry’s presence in his day-to-day life, remembering his stepson as a “larger-than-life person” who always “lit up a room.”
“He was goofy. He was funny. He was acerbic,” Morrison said. “But even if he didn’t say a word, he was the center of attention.”
In describing their relationship, Morrison said he and Perry were, “as they say, chalk and cheese. He was loud and out there and funny and aggressive.”
Morrison recalled taking a young Perry to hockey games on Saturday mornings, remembering that “if he didn’t score all the goals, he was so angry all the way home and he wouldn’t talk to anybody; he was really mad.” Perry would behave much the same way if he missed a shot during a tennis match.
“He had that kind of very fiery personality, and mine is not like that, as you can imagine,” said Morrison, who is widely known for his wry baritone voice. “But we got along fine. … I never tried to replace his dad … but I was there for him, and he knew it.” (Perry’s biological father is the character actor John Bennett Perry, who has appeared in various films and television shows.)
Morrison said he tried to support Perry “as much as possible” over the years.
“That’s a whirlwind of a life, to get involved in a program that became as wildly successful as it was, to be fighting an addiction that was so virulent, that went after him so hard,” Morrison said, adding that Perry would get to a “certain point” when he knew he needed to get treatment and “accept help when he needed it.”
“But as he said himself, it just kept happening … and it was a big bear,” Morrison said. “It was a tough thing … [a] big, terrible thing.”

2024-03-12T20:41:14.260Z,Columbia accused in lawsuit of singling out 2 pro-Palestinian groups by suspending them after protest,NBC News,"Columbia University is being sued by the New York Civil Liberties Union over the school’s decision last fall to suspend two student groups that protested Israel’s conduct in the Gaza war.
The lawsuit announced Tuesday accuses the Ivy League school of violating its own rules by suspending the groups, Students for Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voice for Peace, a day after their Nov. 9 campus protest sponsored by more than 20 groups. The next day, the two groups were suspended for allegedly violating university policy and were given no opportunity to respond to the charges or contest them, the lawsuit says.
That protest came in the heated weeks after the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks that sparked the war and Israel’s subsequent ground invasion of Gaza, when demonstrations were organized by both pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel students at Columbia and other U.S. campuses. Students on both sides complained of harassment and bias incidents.
Columbia had said in a statement that the Nov. 9 demonstration “included threatening rhetoric and intimidation.” The two groups’ suspension, which is still in effect, bans them from holding on-campus events or getting school funding. The lawsuit filed by the NYCLU and Palestine Legal, an advocacy organization, seeks to nullify the suspensions “and related relief.”
“Universities should be havens for robust debate, discussion, and learning — not sites of censorship where administrators, donors, and politicians squash political discourse they don’t approve of,” NYCLU executive director Donna Lieberman said in a news release.
Palestine Legal senior staff attorney Radhika Sainath said universities “must abide by their own rules and may not punish student groups speaking out for Palestinian rights in the moment when they are most essential -– even if donors and lobby groups complain.”
A Columbia spokesperson said university officials would decline to comment on pending litigation. The lawsuit says Columbia would lift the suspension if the two groups show sufficient commitment to following school rules and engaging with university officials.
The suit was filed in state court in Manhattan on Monday, the same day that a Republican-led Congressional committee announced a hearing on antisemitism at Columbia.
University President Minouche Shafik and the two co-chairs of Columbia’s Board of Trustees are expected to testify at the April 17 hearing of the U.S. House Committee on Education and the Workforce.
Columbia officials were asked to testify at the committee’s December hearing during which members grilled the presidents of Harvard, M.I.T. and the University of Pennsylvania over reports of antisemitic incidents at their campuses but cited a scheduling conflict.
Both Penn President Liz Magill and Harvard President Claudine Gay resigned following criticism of their testimony before the committee.
Columbia spokesperson Samantha Slater said the university “is committed to combating antisemitism and we welcome the opportunity to discuss our work to protect and support Jewish students and keep our community safe.”

2024-03-12T19:32:30.746Z,"Judge rules Harmony Montgomery, missing 5-year-old N.H. girl, is legally dead",NBC News,"CONCORD, N.H. — A judge has ruled that a 5-year-old New Hampshire girl missing since 2019 is legally dead and her mother can become administrator of her estate, just weeks after the child’s father was convicted of killing her.
Crystal Sorey “has carried her burden to demonstrate” that her daughter, Harmony Montgomery, was killed “as a result of some catastrophic event” and that her body has not been found, a probate judge said in an order made public Tuesday, a day after Sorey went to court.
Sorey is taking the first steps in preparation of a planned wrongful death lawsuit against the state regarding Harmony Montgomery. Her lawyer told the judge that Adam Montgomery’s second-degree murder conviction, plus his admission of guilt to lesser charges that he moved his daughter’s body around for months afterward and falsified physical evidence, was enough to result in a legal death declaration.
The lawyer also said there was trial testimony from Adam Montgomery’s estranged wife, Kayla Montgomery, that “she had handled Harmony Montgomery’s lifeless body,” according to the judge’s decision.
Sorey’s lawyer still has to provide a copy of the jury’s verdict and a probate surety bond that would guarantee Sorey would fulfill her duties under the law as administrator.
Adam Montgomery and Sorey were not in a relationship when their daughter was born in 2014. Harmony Montgomery lived on and off with foster families and her mother until Sorey lost custody in 2018. Montgomery was awarded custody in early 2019, and Sorey testified she last saw her daughter during a FaceTime call around Easter of that year.
When they were later questioned about Harmony’s whereabouts, Adam and Kayla Montgomery told authorities that he had taken the child to live with Sorey.
Adam Montgomery, in prison awaiting sentencing, chose not to attend the probate hearing via Webex.

2024-03-11T10:00:40.000Z,"Young men say they were drugged, kidnapped, robbed of thousands at Atlanta bars",NBC News,"Eight men said they lost consciousness and were then robbed of thousands of dollars while out at bars in a wealthy Atlanta neighborhood from November 2021 to last month, according to conversations with six of the men and police reports filed by two others.
The men said they believed they were drugged or described feeling abnormally intoxicated shortly before their phones were used to transfer thousands of dollars out of their bank accounts — largely using mobile payment apps such as Venmo, Zelle, Apple Cash, PayPal and CashApp — and their credit cards were used to make fraudulent purchases, according to documentation victims shared with NBC News and police records.
Five of the eight men — one of whom was the subject of an NBC News report in February — also alleged that while they were in and out of consciousness on the nights of their encounters, they were driven around Atlanta in unfamiliar cars by strangers.
The alleged incidents occurred after the men went out to bars in Buckhead, an affluent Atlanta neighborhood known for its vibrant nightlife and young crowd. After NBC News reported about an incident at Five Paces Inn, a bar in the neighborhood, additional alleged victims reached out with similar accounts. NBC News found other alleged victims through social media and public records requests to the Atlanta Police Department focusing on several local bars.
While four men said the alleged crimes occurred at Five Paces Inn, others said incidents took place at three other popular bars in the area: Thirty, Johnny’s Hideaway and The Ivy Buckhead.
Six of the men reported the crimes to the police, and all of their cases remain open, according to a spokesperson for the APD, officer Anthony Grant.
Revelations about the alleged crimes in Atlanta come nearly two years after NBC News began reporting on a spate of crimes with notable similarities in New York City, with some targeting gay bars. Criminals incapacitated and robbed over three dozen victims after gaining access to their phones, prosecutors alleged, resulting in the deaths of at least seven people.
In one of the cases in Atlanta, Chandler Rebel, 24, said he was robbed of about $13,000 after visiting Five Paces Inn with friends in August 2022.
The last thing Rebel remembers at the bar was ordering a round of drinks for his friends. He then recalls briefly coming to in the back seat of an accelerating vehicle while being restrained by an unknown person.
“I just remember everything was black in there, trying to scream, but it was like a hand was over me, forcing more of that substance down my mouth,” Rebel said, explaining that it was something solid, but he’s not sure what.
He said he woke up several hours later while “violently” throwing up blood in a gas station bathroom 3 miles away from the bar. Rebel filed a police report about a week after the alleged incident and his case is still active.
A spokesperson said that the sports bar and music venue takes the safety of its patrons “very seriously” and encouraged victims of crimes at the bar to contact the police.
“Five Paces is aware of reports of criminal activity occurring in and around Buckhead but is not aware of any criminal activities taking place within Five Paces,” the spokesperson, Scott A. Minot, said in an email. “Five Paces has not been contacted by any alleged victims or the police and has no additional information or knowledge about any of these incidents or reports.”
Johnny’s Hideaway also said that the police never contacted the bar to inquire about any of the alleged crimes. The Ivy Buckhead and Thirty Bar did not return NBC News’ requests for comment.
“The Atlanta Police Department is aware of these cases and is investigating each,” Sgt. John Chafee said in a statement. “While we are not at a point of releasing details on each of these investigations, I can tell you these are cases we take seriously and our investigators are committed to finding who is responsible and apprehending them.”
Rebel and the five men who spoke with NBC News described blackouts on the nights of their incidents that they said did not resemble the effects of alcohol. They said they consumed typical amounts of alcohol, but described feeling “funny” or “dizzy” before losing consciousness. Some of the men also described experiencing a sensation similar to paralysis, where they lost control of their speech and movements.
Chris, a 26-year-old Atlanta resident who asked that his last name not be published out of fear of retaliation by the people who harmed him, said he was robbed of roughly $13,500 after visiting Buckhead bar The Ivy Buckhead in November 2021. Chris, as well as other men who say they were robbed, shared screenshots of bank accounts showing fraudulent transactions.
The last thing Chris remembers before fading in and out of consciousness was standing at the bar alone to buy a drink. He suspects something might have been slipped into his drink. As with Rebel, his only other memory consists of being slumped over in the back seat of an unknown moving car that night, unable to control his words or body.
“It’s a feeling I haven’t had like any other — it didn’t feel like a drunk. I don’t know how else to say it,” he said. “It felt like I wasn’t fully there.”
Chris said he tried to report the incident at a police station just outside of Atlanta — closer to his home — in the days afterward, but was told he had to file the report at a police station in the city. He said that when he went to a police precinct in Buckhead, he waited 30 minutes to speak with an officer. But with no updates on how much longer it would be, he gave up and left.
One of the eight men, 25-year-old Jace Curry, recalled being physically threatened.
Curry said he was robbed of about $10,000 after visiting Five Paces Inn last September. Two men he met at the bar that night invited him to leave with them and attend a late-night party, he said.
“About five steps out of the bar, they ended up putting what I felt like was a gun to my back and made me go to this ATM and pull them out money,” Curry said, adding that he later discovered that his phone and wallet were missing.
Curry said he would never have left a bar with two strangers if it were not for how intoxicated he felt. “I’m also a heavyweight, so, I mean, I don’t get drunk that easy and it felt like I got drunk real quick,” he said.
Curry reported the encounter to police the next morning and his case is still active, according to police.
All of the men who spoke with NBC News described being in awe of the sophistication of the crimes. Two of them said that in the mornings after their encounters, they woke up with debit cards and phones that didn’t belong to them. They said it created confusion and delayed their ability to stop fraudulent transactions sooner.
“It felt super organized,” Chris said. “The existence of a decoy phone signals to me that there is planning going on behind the scenes. There is a system in play.”
Chris said the Verizon store connected him with the person whose phone he was in possession of, who turned out to be another man whose phone was stolen after visiting an Atlanta bar on an earlier date.
Of the six men who spoke with NBC News, four of them reported their encounters to police. The four men said they shared a trove of records with officers, including receipts of credit card transactions, bank statements and personal information they obtained of their presumed assailants. That included phone numbers, addresses where packages were shipped and the names associated with third-party payment accounts that received the fraudulent transactions.
They described the police as brushing off what they described as volumes of evidence or information for leads.
“I literally gave the police department every single piece of the puzzle, and they could care less,” said Shawn Brown, who said he believes he was drugged and robbed of about $12,000 after visiting Johnny’s Hideaway in March 2023.
Brown reported the incident to police two days after and his case remains ongoing, according to police.
“We understand the frustrations of some victims, but we are actively investigating and working to identify anyone involved in these crimes,” said Chafee, who added that crimes like this are challenging to investigate and significant work is often required to identify suspects. “We urge anyone who has been the victim of a crime to call police and report it as soon as possible. Reporting crime quickly aids in the investigation as well as in identifying crime trends.”
The owner of Johnny’s Hideaway, Chris D’Auria, said in an email that the venue has no record of Brown’s incident, “but certainly do not like to hear that things of that nature have occurred.” D’Auria added that the bar has a police officer on site on its busiest nights, Wednesday through Saturday, along with hired security staff.
“No one, including management had been told or approached by anyone about any drugging/robbery,” he said.
Chafee said that police have increased patrols in the area, and he offered safety tips, like keeping valuables at home and not leaving drinks unattended.
Rebel said when he initially went to police to report the crime, the officer assigned to take his report accused him of fabricating the encounter and warned him that lying to a police officer is illegal.
“Here I am asking for help to get these monsters who did this to me and have done this to other people, and they’re the victim? That terrified me after that experience,” Rebel said. “These boys in blue are supposed to protect me and these ones wouldn’t even hear me.”
The APD did not respond to questions about Rebel’s alleged interactions with the police.
Although the men have not had their cases solved, the majority of them said they recovered most, if not all, of the funds taken from their bank accounts and third-party payment apps after reporting the fraudulent transactions to their banks. Still, some of them were not able to recover their iCloud accounts from Apple and lost access to years of photos and videos.
NBC News reached out to Apple, which did not comment. The company released a new security mode, Stolen Device Protection, in January that is intended to thwart bad actors from learning or changing users’ passcodes.
While it is unclear exactly how the alleged victims’ phones were accessed, those who spoke with NBC News wondered if thieves surreptitiously watched them enter their passcodes, utilized hacking software or used their unconscious faces to unlock their phones via Face ID technology.
Rebel said that losing all of his photographs from high school and college was devastating but has led him to appreciate life in ways he didn’t before his encounter.
“I lost every picture I ever took, but I still get the opportunity to take pictures. I wasn’t like those unfortunate gentlemen in New York,” he said referring to men who were killed with illicit drugs after visiting New York City bars in 2022. “The only pictures they have now are the ones under their obituaries.”

2024-03-12T14:32:41.996Z,LaGuardia Airport among best airports in country after years of bad reputation,NBC News,"After having held the reputation as one of the worst airports in the country, LaGuardia Airport in New York has made a complete turnaround, being awarded the best airport of its size based on a new passenger survey.
Airports Council International honored LaGuardia with an Airport Service Quality, or ASQ, award as the ""best airport of 25 to 40 million passengers in North America"" last year.
The recognition marks the success of a multibillion-dollar transformation at the airport in Queens, taking it from worst to best in five years.
""When we started out on our $8 billion transformation of LaGuardia, few believed we could create the world-class airport our region deserves. But the ASQ award proves that seeing is believing,"" Rick Cotton, executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, said in a statement Monday.
LaGuardia Gateway Partners CEO Suzette Noble said, ""The ASQ award is a testament to the hard work and dedication of not only those who designed and built the new airport, but to those providing exceptional service each and every day.""
With the completion of new terminals and airport roadways, 2023 became the first full year all passenger facilities were in use at LaGuardia, the Port Authority said.
The renovations led to a 20% increase from 2018 survey scores, with overall passenger satisfaction earning a rating of 4.24 out of 5.
The largest drivers behind the jump in passenger satisfaction were the airport's ambience and facility cleanliness, which increased by 21% and 15%, respectively, over the last five years. Other improved factors included security screening, dining facilities and the comfort of gate areas, the Port Authority said.
More than 4,200 passengers completed the ASQ survey at gates in LaGuardia Airport throughout 2023.
""There is no better judge of our new airports than the passengers who use them, which is why the ASQ award for best airport going to LaGuardia is so meaningful,"" Port Authority Chairman Kevin O'Toole said.

2024-03-12T13:04:29.728Z,3 of 4 suspects arrested in Philadelphia bus stop shooting that injured 8 teens,NBC News,"PHILADELPHIA — Two 18-year-olds were arrested in the shooting of eight Philadelphia high school students at a bus stop last week, and authorities recovered a fully loaded, fully automatic weapon that matches evidence found at the scene, they announced Monday.
A third suspect, 19-year-old Jermahd Carter, was taken into custody by U.S. marshals Tuesday afternoon, NBC Philadelphia reported. Online records about Carter could not be found Tuesday night on the website for Pennsylvania's court system or the website for the Federal Bureau of Prisons.
A 17-year-old suspect was still being sought, the Marshals Service  told NBC Philadelphia.
The Wednesday afternoon shooting was the fourth in four days involving the city’s transit system.
The discovery of the stolen car involved, just hours later, helped lead police to suspect Jamaal Tucker, who turned himself in Friday, police said. On Saturday, they said, federal marshals searched a location linked to Ahnile Buggs and recovered the .40-caliber Glock that matched casings found at the scene.
Both teens face the same charges, including attempted murder, aggravated assault, weapons offenses and other charges, and are being held on more than $2 million bail. Preliminary hearings are scheduled March 20 for both. A message left Monday with Buggs’ attorney was not immediately returned. Tucker is being represented by public defenders, who did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.
Mayor Cherelle Parker led a group of public officials at a Monday afternoon news conference, including the heads of the local FBI and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives offices, to try to assure anxious city residents they are working to address the spate of transit crime.
“We will focus on prevention, intervention and enforcement,” said Parker, who took office in January and promised to present her public safety strategies in the coming weeks “in an effort to bring lawfulness and some order back to our city.”
She urged an end to the finger-pointing that has caused friction between the police department, reform-minded District Attorney Larry Krasner and other agencies in recent years.
The shooting Wednesday came as students at nearby Northeast High School were waiting to board the bus home.
About 3 p.m., three masked suspects rounded the corner and opened fire, surveillance video shared by police shows. The victims were ages 15 to 17. All of them are now in stable condition, police said Monday, including a 16-year-old who was critically injured after being hit nine times.
The city’s police commissioner, Kevin Bethel, credited quick action by two police officers in applying tourniquets to three of the victims with possibly saving lives.
Northeast High School is the largest public high school in the city, with more than 3,000 students.
Police were investigating whether the shooting may have been related to the fatal shooting of a 17-year-old charter school student, when gunmen fired 40 shots at close range as people boarded a city bus in the city’s Ogontz section. Four others were injured, including a 70-year-old woman.
Also last week, police believe an argument aboard a bus led a 37-year-old man to be fatally shot by a passenger exiting a bus in South Philadelphia. And a 27-year-old man was killed by another passenger moments after they both got off a bus in the city’s Oxford Circle area.

2024-03-12T15:02:38.562Z,Seattle-area woman reported missing in February found dead in Mexico cemetery,NBC News,"A Seattle-area woman who disappeared in February was found dead in a cemetery on the side of a highway in Mexicali, Mexico, police in Washington state said.
Mexican authorities arrested a suspect in the case, a 61-year-old Renton resident, on charges unrelated to the death of Reyna Hernandez, Renton police said Monday in a Facebook statement.
If it is determined that Hernandez was killed in the U.S., authorities would seek to extradite the suspect, Renton police said, noting that once the manner and the time of death are confirmed, detectives can determine whether a homicide was committed.
Hernandez, 54, was found dead after Renton police were alerted to a Mexicali news article Friday about an unidentified body at a cemetery on the Tijuana Highway.
Investigators contacted Mexican authorities and ""were able to provide enough information to identify Hernandez,"" Renton police said.
Her vehicle was also found in Mexico.
The discovery was made about a week after friends reported Hernandez missing on Feb. 28 when she did not return home from running errands and failed to open her salon in Renton Highlands, police said.
Authorities believe she disappeared from a home two days before. A friend told police that he last spoke with her on Feb. 26 and that she said she was out running errands and was going to a home in South Renton, according to the police department's initial news release.
Investigators served multiple search warrants and followed up on dozens of leads. Evidence showed that Hernandez ""was taken against her will,"" police said.
Authorities have released very few details, including how long they believe Hernandez was in Mexico and her connection to the suspect. Renton police said they believe it was a ""domestic violence crime.""
""This is the worst possible outcome, and our hearts go out to Reyna’s family and friends,"" Investigations Commander Chandler Swain said in a statement.
Swain said police are working with Mexicali police and U.S. federal partners to determine when and where Hernandez was killed.
Renton is a suburb about 12 miles southeast of Seattle.

The mission to find Texas A&M Corpus Christi student Caleb Harris, 21, is focused on an area behind the North Padre Island apartment complex where he lives, as well as eastern and southern sections of the community, NBC affiliate WOAI of San Antonio reported.
Hundreds of people have volunteered to scour the area, and Corpus Christi police officers have been joined by members of the Coast Guard as they look for Harris, the station said.
He vanished in the dark of the early morning on March 4, and his roommates failed to find him that day, police said. Family members ultimately filed a missing person's report, they said.
Harris had his phone, which had been off, but he left behind his vehicle, keys and wallet, police said.
Family members told Fox News he was in communication with them as late as 2:45 a.m. that day. He walked his dog, returned and went back outside to meet a food delivery driver, they told the network.
The delivery platform marked the order as completed, the family members told Fox News.
Police and Texas A&M Corpus Christi representatives did not immediately respond to requests for more information. Both have distributed missing person's bulletins about Harris' case.

2024-03-14T14:00:30.726Z,Tire issue reported as American Airlines Boeing 777 flight lands in L.A.,NBC News,"The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating another Boeing mishap after a tire issue was reported as an American Airlines flight landed Wednesday night in Los Angeles.
American Airlines Flight 345, which was operated on a Boeing 777 plane, landed around 8:45 p.m. local time, after it “blew a tire during take off” from Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, the FAA said.
However, American Airlines said Thursday morning there was no blown tire, and the pilot had received an indication that the pressure was low in one of the aircraft’s tires.
""The aircraft taxied to the gate under its own power and customers deplaned normally,"" American said.
LAX said the flight landed safely without any further incident.
Wednesday's tire issue comes on the heels of another last week involving a Boeing plane. In that incident, a tire flew off a United Airlines Boeing 777-200 plane shortly after takeoff from San Francisco, prompting an emergency landing at LAX.
United said at the time that the Boeing 777-200 has “six tires on each of its two main landing gear struts” and is “designed to land safely with missing or damaged tires.”
The incidents are among the latest issues involving a Boeing plane to make headlines. The aircraft manufacturing giant has been under intense scrutiny after an Alaska Airlines door panel on a Boeing 737 Max 9 plane blew out midair over Portland, Oregon, on Jan. 5.
The incident prompted the FAA to temporarily ground all Boeing 737 Max 9 airplanes operating in the U.S. and subsequently increase oversight over Boeing aircraft production.

2024-03-12T14:25:29.264Z,Women’s roller derby league sues suburban New York county over trans athlete ban,NBC News,"A women’s roller derby league has asked a New York court to invalidate a Republican official’s order banning female sports teams with transgender athletes from using county facilities, saying it violates state law.
The lawsuit, filed Monday in state court on behalf of the Long Island Roller Rebels, argues that the state’s human rights and civil rights statutes explicitly prohibit discrimination based on gender identity.
It’s the latest salvo in a battle over an executive order issued Feb. 22 by Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman that covers more than 100 athletic facilities in the densely populated county next to New York City, including ballfields, basketball and tennis courts, swimming pools and ice rinks.
The order requires any teams, leagues or organizations seeking a permit from the county’s parks and recreation department to “expressly designate” whether they are for male, female or coed athletes.
Any teams designated as “female” would be denied permits if they allow transgender athletes to participate. The ban doesn’t apply to men’s teams with transgender athletes.
“This cruel policy sends the dangerous message that trans people don’t belong in Nassau County,” Amanda “Curly Fry” Urena, a member of the Roller Rebels, said in a statement. “We hope the court sees this policy for what it is — transphobic and unjust — and makes sure Nassau County is a safe space for trans, non-binary, and gender-expansive people.”
Blakeman, in response, said he’s “disappointed” the New York Civil Liberties Union, which filed the lawsuit on behalf of the roller derby league, is not “joining us in our fight to protect women.”
The Republican, who was elected in 2022, has argued the ban is intended to protect girls and women from getting injured if they are forced to compete against transgender women.
Last week, he filed a lawsuit asking a federal court in New York to affirm that the order was legal after state Attorney General Letitia James warned him in a “cease and desist” letter that the ban violated New York’s anti-discrimination laws. Spokespeople for James didn’t comment Monday.
The Roller Rebels say in their suit that they applied Monday for a permit to host a slate of games at roller rinks in various county parks starting next month, as they’ve used the venues in previous years for practices and other events.
But the Nassau County-based league says it expects this year’s request to be denied, as it welcomes “all transgender women, intersex women, and gender-expansive women” to participate on its teams.
The league, which was founded in 2005 and is a member of the Women’s Flat Track Derby Association, added that it currently has at least one league member who would be prohibited from participating under the county’s order.
The lawsuit states that the league is “now faced with the choice to either exclude transgender women from their league — in direct contradiction to their internal values and state law — or forego access to Nassau County facilities.”
The suit cites the state’s Gender Expression Non-Discrimination Act, or GENDA, as well as guidance from the state Division of Human Rights, which confirms that public accommodations cannot deny transgender people access to programs and activities consistent with their gender identity.
Gabriella Larios, an attorney with the NYCLU, said Nassau County’s order is part of a growing number of attacks on LGBTQ rights nationwide.
Bills banning trans youth from participating in sports have already passed in 24 states, though some have been blocked by ongoing litigation, she said.
“As promised the day this executive order was issued, we’re taking action so that the courts relegate this harmful, transphobic policy to the dustbin of history, where it belongs,” Larios said.

2024-03-13T22:02:49.874Z,Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott sues woman over alleged $100 million extortion plan,NBC News,"Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott has filed a lawsuit against a woman he claims tried to extort him out of $100 million by alleging he sexually assaulted her after his rookie season.
The suit, filed Monday in Collin County, Texas, names the woman who made the claims as a defendant as well as her attorneys Bethel Zehaie and Yoel Zehaie.
“This case arises out of a blatant attempt by [the woman] and her legal team to extort plaintiff Dak Prescott by weaponizing patently false, yet heinous sexual assault allegations with no basis in reality,” the lawsuit said.
Attempts by NBC News to reach the woman along with her lawyers were unsuccessful Wednesday. NBC News doesn’t typically name alleged sexual assault victims.
“Dak and his lawyers are trying to be bullies and play hardball and victim blame,” Bethel Zehaie said in a statement to The Washington Post. “We are not afraid of the truth.”
Around February 13, Prescott’s representatives received correspondence from the woman’s legal counsel, accusing Prescott of sexually assaulting her in February 2017 following his rookie season with the Dallas Cowboys, the suit states.
The woman requested $100 million in exchange for foregoing pressing criminal charges and going public with the allegations, the suit said.
“We will not allow the defendant and her legal team to profit from this attempt to extort millions from Mr. Prescott,” Prescott’s attorney, Levi McCathern, said in a statement.
On Monday, Bethel Zehaie told NBC 5 in Dallas that the alleged sexual assault happened in 2017 outside XTC Cabaret.
The defendant didn’t work at the Dallas club and did not file a police report at the time, Zehaie told the station. The legal team added that they would be filing a criminal complaint on behalf of the accuser.
“Sexual assault is a despicable crime that no person should ever endure,” the suit said, adding that Prescott is a new father to a baby girl and has great empathy for survivors of sexual assault.
The defendants’ “horrible lies not only threaten to destroy the legitimate legacy of a great man and cost him tens of millions of dollars, but defendants’ conduct is criminal,” the suit said. Prescott seeks $1 million in damages, attorney fees and court costs.
Presctott’s lawyers said allegations such as the ones presented to him in the alleged extortion plot can prevent sexual assault survivors from coming forward.
“False claims in this regard undermine the courage of actual sexual assault survivors everywhere as well as the legitimacy of the horrific traumas they have endured,” the suit said.
In 2021, Prescott signed a four-year deal with the Cowboys worth $160 million, NBC Sports reported.

Officials in New York identified the two soldiers who died as Army National Guard members Casey Frankoski and John Grassia III. The  Border Patrol agent was identified as Chris Luna by the Department of Homeland Security.
The injured person is also a New York Army National Guard soldier, according to the National Guard Bureau.
The UH-72 Lakota helicopter crashed around 2:50 p.m. local time while it was ""conducting aviation operations"" in the area of Rio Grande City, on the border of Texas and Mexico, according to a statement from the Defense Department’s Joint Task Force North.
The helicopter had been assigned to a support mission at the southwest border of the U.S., the statement said.
Michael Stammel, the mayor of Rensselaer, New York, said in a post on Facebook that Frankoski was a Rensselaer native and excellent student who ""excelled in sports and community service before joining the New York National Guard,"" where she was a helicopter pilot.
Grassia, 30, joined the New York State Police in April 2022 and was most recently assigned to Troop G, according to the New York State Troopers Police Benevolent Association.
He ""was dedicated to serving and protecting not only the citizens of New York State but also the citizens of the entire United States,"" the association said.
In a statement, President Joe Biden said the third soldier “was badly injured in the crash and is hospitalized.” There were no further details about the soldier’s current condition.
“These brave Americans dedicated their lives to protecting our nation. They signed up knowing the risks and believing in the mission of serving their fellow Americans by keeping our nation safe,” Biden said in the statement. “Our gratitude is profound, and their sacrifice will never be forgotten.”
Gen. Daniel Hokanson, the National Guard bureau chief, said the deaths of the two Army National Guard members and the Border Patrol officer were tragic.
""We mourn these heartbreaking deaths. They are a tragic loss beyond words,"" Hokanson said in a statement. ""We pray for the speedy recovery of a third Guard Soldier who was seriously injured. All of these people represent selfless service & the best of America.""
Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said on X that he is sending his ""deepest condolences to the families of the National Guard soldier & Border Patrol agent who passed away & those who were injured in a helicopter crash near La Grulla, TX.""
The cause of the crash is under investigation.

Whereas the acting nominees had long presentations, the best picture presentation was rushed: Pacino didn’t read out the nominees.
Rather than mention each movie by name, Pacino only said, “Ten wonderful films were nominated, but only one will take the award for best picture.”
Then he gestured to his envelope. “I have to go to the envelope for that. Here it comes,” he said, opening it up.
Looking at the paper, he started talking. “And my eyes see ‘Oppenheimer,’” he said.
Some clapping could be heard, but it seemed like Pacino was still speaking. “Yes. Yes,” he continued, reading the names of the producers. More clapping occurred before it finally became apparent that “Oppenheimer” was the winner.
The somewhat anticlimactic moment led to a spirited conversation online.
“Al Pacino announcing Oppenheimer’s best picture win with the casualness of announcing what he wants to eat for dinner at Chili’s is why I watch The Oscars,” one X user wrote.
Another compared his tone to a bear stumbling out of a cave.
They noticed how he skipped reading the nominations and cut straight what his “eyes” saw: “Oppenheimer.”
“Al Pacino not even presenting the rest of the nominations and going straight to the winner is such a hilarious yet Oscar worthy performance in its own right,” someone wrote.
Others weren’t as taken with the moment, calling it “all kinds of awkward.”
Writer Spencer Althouse concluded it “couldn’t have been more chaotic or confusing,” but said he was still “obsessed.”

2024-03-12T16:59:10.570Z,A new generation of readers embraces bell hooks’ ‘All About Love’,NBC News,"In the summer of 2022, Emma Goodwin was getting over a breakup and thinking hard about her life and how to better herself. She decided to try a book she had heard about often, bell hooks’ “All About Love: New Visions.”
“I loved it. It takes seriously a subject that is scoffed at in popular culture, that a lot of people see as silly,” says Goodwin, 26, a social media coordinator who lives in Philadelphia. “What has stuck with me over the past couple of years since I read it is the idea that to be a loving person is something you have to work at and not something that comes naturally.”
Brianna Pippen, a visual artist in the Washington, D.C. area, has read “All About Love” a couple times, and values it for how it explores not just romantic love, but families and friends and relationships in general. Tiffany Stewart, a writer and producer in Los Angeles, first read “All About Love” two years ago with her reading group and reread it recently.
Just from the book’s introduction, she knew it was going to “crack open” her mind and change everything she had believed.
“We’ve always been told that love should just feel good. It should be fluffy and light and easy. And that means you’re looking at the media version of love,” she said.
Published by William Morrow and Company in 2000, “All About Love” endures as a word-of-mouth favorite — the kind of book that continues to be read and discussed even without any breaking news event, movie tie-in or publicity campaign. Friends recommend it to friends. Fans post about it on Instagram and TikTok and review it on Goodreads, where more than 190,000 members have included it on their to-read list.
According to Circana, which tracks around 85% of physical book sales, “All About Love” sold more than 170,000 copies in 2023, compared to just over 27,000 in 2018. Morrow editor Rachel Kahan cites the murder of George Floyd in 2020 as a turning point, although sales were already rising.
“I think this is one of those situations where the book’s been around a while and the culture rises up to meet it,” says Kahan, who was working with hooks at the time of her death, in December 2021. A few months before, Kahan had told the author that “All About Love” made The New York Times bestseller list.
“We were kind of laughing and crying,” the editor said. “She was so excited that the book was getting all this attention from readers and influencing the conversation.”
Scholars of hooks welcome the late feminist’s ongoing popularity, but some worry that readers are gaining only a selective understanding of her, viewing her more as a self-help author than as a political and social thinker.
The pen name for Gloria Jean Watkins, bell hooks helped popularize the idea of “intersectionality,” a concept coined by Black civil rights advocate Kimberlé Crenshaw, also known for her work on the concept of critical race theory. Intersectionality holds that racism, sexism and economic inequality reinforce each other and shape (and distort) the ways we see ourselves, and each other.
Author of more than 30 books, hooks explored everything from the lasting impact of slavery on Black women to the failure of white feminists to work more closely with their Black contemporaries. In her lifetime, she was often cited for the 1981 book “Ain’t I a Woman? Black Women and Feminism,” its title taken from the memoir of 19th century abolitionist Sojourner Truth.
She wrote often about love, family and community, but within the framework of a society that hooks saw as isolating us and setting us against each other. In “All About Love,” she rejected the “dangerous narcissism” of New Age thinkers, and contended that love had been distorted by “our obsession with power and commodity.” The problem often began at home, she wrote, where too many children were subjected to “chaos, neglect, abuse and coercion.”
“There can be no love without justice,” hooks wrote. “Until we live in a culture that not only respects but also upholds basic civil rights for children, most children will not know love.”
M. Shadee Malaklou, who directs the bell hooks center at Berea College in Berea, Kentucky, where hooks taught over the final decade and a half of her life, says that some find it “convenient to flatten out a feminist of color.”
“bell was never depoliticized,” she says. “For bell, the love she talks about is a love for justice. ‘All About Love’ is a love letter to justice.”
Stewart said she found that “All About Love” had both a personal and political message, aligning the “individual journey” with the ”communal and societal one.” We are affected on many levels by “this hyper-individualistic energy and temporary satisfaction,” Stewart added, and the book “teaches us to think outside of ourselves, which is important because we can’t get through life without one another.”
The author was in her mid-40s and had been publishing books for 20 years when she signed with William Morrow for “All About Love,” the first of a “Love Song to the Nation” trilogy that also included “Communion” and “Salvation.” The original editor of “All About Love,” Doris Cooper, says she and hooks would work on the book at the author’s Greenwich Village apartment.
“I remember how beautiful that apartment was, and that is was so light-filled. And when I look back, I think that was not insignificant. bell believed in beautiful things as a representation of love towards oneself,” says Cooper, now vice president and editor-in-chief of Simon Element, an imprint of Simon & Schuster.
“One day, I was walking in the Village with her, and we passed a little jewelry store. She admired something in there and she bought it for herself. I was really struck by the idea of buying yourself jewelry.”
Lily Edelman-Gold, who lives in Monterey, California, and works for the state’s energy commission, was going through a time of “intense loneliness” when she borrowed a copy of “All About Love” from a friend, and wrote down favorite passages in a notebook. She responded to hooks’ insistence that love was more a verb than a noun, an act of will as opposed to an abstract ideal. Edelman-Gold also found herself discovering love’s once-hidden presence.
“It was almost as though I could feel all the love in my life wrapping itself around me, filling me up and making itself known,” Edelman-Gold said. “The differences between romantic and familial or friendship-based love had suddenly gotten much smaller and less consequential. I realized that I had been conflating love and romance, as she says many do, and assuming that love needs to come from the same source as intimate and romantic satisfaction.
“It has allowed me to appreciate the fun and happiness intimacy can bring without the expectation that it also provides all the love in my life.”

2024-03-08T17:55:22.107Z,United Airlines flight rolls off runway at Houston airport,NBC News,"A United Airlines flight rolled off the runway at a Houston airport Friday morning, the airline said in a statement.
The Boeing 737 plane had landed at George Bush Intercontinental Airport around 8 a.m. when it rolled onto the grass as it exited the runway for the gate, United and Houston Airports and Houston Spaceport said in separate statements.
The flight, which left from Memphis International Airport, had 160 passengers and six crew members on board. Passengers deplaned on the taxiway and were bused to the terminal.
No one on board was injured.
The incident did not disrupt other flights. A spokesperson for Houston Airports said flights into and out of the airport continued Friday without interruption.
It’s not clear what caused the plane to veer off the runway. The Federal Aviation Administration will investigate the incident.
This is just the latest mishap involving a plane. On Monday, a United Airlines flight from Texas to Florida had to make an emergency landing after flames started shooting out of the engine. Last month, a United Airlines plane experienced “stuck” rudder pedals after landing at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey. That incident prompted an investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board.

2024-03-11T23:01:22.619Z,Kansas judge says barring driver’s license changes doesn’t violate trans people’s rights,NBC News,"TOPEKA, Kan. — A Kansas judge ruled Monday that the state isn’t violating transgender residents’ rights under the state constitution by refusing to change their driver’s licenses to reflect their gender identities.
District Judge Teresa Watson kept in place indefinitely an order she first issued in July 2023 to prevent the Kansas Department of Revenue from changing the listing for “sex” on transgender people’s driver’s licenses. Attorney General Kris Kobach, a conservative Republican, sued Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s administration to stop such changes in line with a 2023 law that ended legal recognition of transgender people’s identities.
Watson allowed transgender Kansas residents to intervene in Kobach’s lawsuit, and the American Civil Liberties Union argued on their behalf that the no-changes policy violated rights protected by the Kansas Constitution. The Kansas Supreme Court declared in 2019 that the state constitution grants a right to bodily autonomy, though the decision dealt with abortion rights, not LGBTQ rights.
Watson said invoking the right to bodily autonomy to require the state to change driver’s licenses would be “an unreasonable stretch.” She said Kansas residents do not have a fundamental right under the state constitution to “control what information is displayed on a state-issued driver’s license.”
“Information recorded on a driver’s license does not interfere with transgender persons’ ability to control their own bodies or assert bodily integrity or self-determination,” Watson wrote in her 31-page order, issued in Shawnee County, home to the state capital of Topeka.
Kelly supports LGBTQ rights. After she took office in 2019, her administration allowed transgender people to change their driver’s licenses and birth certificates to reflect their gender identities.
The Republican-controlled Legislature overrode her veto to enact the 2023 law, and transgender people can no longer change either identity document, thanks to Kobach’s efforts.
It’s not clear whether Kelly’s administration or transgender Kansas residents will appeal Watson’s ruling. D.C. Hiegert, an ACLU of Kansas LGBGQ legal fellow who is trans, predicted that Watson’s ruling will lead to transgender people being harassed and denied services.
“What possible reason can we articulate to deny our transgender population peace of mind?” added Pedro Irigonegaray, a Topeka attorney representing the Kelly administration. “Why this vindictive attitude towards this class of individuals?”
The Kansas law was part of a wave of measures from GOP-controlled Legislatures across the U.S. to roll back transgender rights. Montana, North Dakota and Tennessee also enacted laws defining man and woman, and Republican governors issued executive orders in Nebraska and Oklahoma, where nonbinary teenager Nex Benedict was bullied and died after a fight in a girls bathroom at a school. Similar measures have been proposed in at least 13 other states.
The Kansas law doesn’t mention driver’s licenses or birth certificates but says for the purposes of any state law or regulation, a person’s sex is “either male or female,” based on their “biological reproductive system” identified at birth. Watson ruled that the law’s language is clear and “there are no exceptions.”
Kobach said in a statement: “This decision is a victory for the rule of law and common sense.”
Watson’s ruling came the day before the Kansas House planned to debate a proposed ban on gender-affirming care for transgender minors, something at least 23 other states have done. A final House vote was expected Wednesday.
“We will continue working toward a vision of our state that allows all of us to live in peace, free from government persecution and impositions on our core identities,” Hiegert said in a statement.

2024-03-08T18:57:43.107Z,Chicago confirms two cases of measles after city resident and migrant child diagnosed,NBC News,"Chicago authorities have identified two cases of measles as of Friday, one city resident and a migrant child at a shelter, the first cases reported in Chicago since 2019.
In the case of the city resident, the source of infection was unknown and the person was “recovering well at home,” the Chicago Department of Public Health said Thursday, adding that their infectious period ended on March 6.
On Friday, the department announced a second confirmed case of measles, this time in a young child who was staying at a shelter for migrant families. The child has also recovered and was no longer infectious, according to a statement.
The department has said it is working to determine and notify people who may have come in contact with the two people diagnosed with measles.
Residents of the migrant shelter, in the neighborhood of Pilsen, were asked to remain in place until authorities can determine who is vaccinated and thus immune to measles, and who might be at risk for infection, a statement from the public health agency said.
“Those who have been vaccinated can leave the shelter while those who have not been vaccinated will have to remain,” the statement said. “All unvaccinated residents will be screened for symptoms and offered the measles vaccine.”
City agencies will be establishing a process to assess the vaccination status of all shelter residents early on Friday, the statement said.
Most Chicago residents are vaccinated for measles during childhood and are not at a high risk of contracting the illness, the public health authority said.
Alderman Byron Sigcho-Lopez, of the 25th Ward in Chicago, said in a statement that the population of the migrant shelter was 1,876 people this week, including 95 toddlers between the ages of 1 and 2. That number is down from a population of 2,550 last year, he said.
As for the case diagnosed in the city resident, the department said it identified no recent travel outside of the city, but the person reported interactions with domestic and international travelers.
The city urged people who were at Swedish Hospital on Feb. 27 between 8:30 a.m. and 12 p.m., or who were on Chicago Transit Authority Bus 92 between 9:15 a.m. and 11:30 a.m. on the same day, to call the department to determine next steps.
“While cases of measles are exceedingly rare in Chicago due to high vaccination coverage from childhood, reports of measles cases have been increasing recently internationally and in the United States,” the department said in its Thursday statement.
There were five cases of measles diagnosed in the state of Illinois in 2023; prior to that the state hadn't seen a case since 2019, the statement said.
No link has been established between the current measles case in the city resident and a measles case of an Indiana man who visited Chicago last month, the statement said, adding that the latter case did not result in any additional measles cases in Chicago residents.
“The MMR vaccine is 97% effective at stopping transmission of measles and has enabled us to live in a time when seeing cases of measles at all is a rarity,” department Commissioner Dr. Olusimbo Ige said in a statement at the time. “It is never too late to get vaccinated against this virus, not only to protect yourself but also to protect those around you who may be unable or too young to be vaccinated themselves.”

2024-03-13T15:29:43.149Z,"University of Missouri student, 22, missing after he was asked to leave Nashville bar during fraternity trip",NBC News,"A family is pleading for answers in the search for a University of Missouri student who has been missing since Friday after he left a bar in Nashville, Tennessee.
Riley Strain, 22, a senior, was last seen Friday night by friends at a bar in Nashville’s bustling Broadway area, known for nightlife, Nashville police said.
He was visiting town with his Delta Chi fraternity brothers for their spring formal, the St. Louis-Post Dispatch reported, but they got separated after he was asked to leave country singer Luke Bryan's bar, Luke’s 32 Bridge Food + Drink, his family told NBC affiliate WSMV of Nashville.
“At approximately 9:45 p.m., he was asked to leave Luke Bryan’s bar,” Strain’s stepfather, Chris Whiteid, told the station. “They got separated. The boys called him, and he said, 'I’m walking back to my hotel.' They didn’t think anything about it.”
When his friends returned to Tempo Hotel, about a half-mile away, they saw Strain’s room key but no sign of him. When they tried to call him, his phone was dead.
The young men went out to search for him, checked his Snapchat locations, and they went through the other fraternity brothers’ rooms but did not find him, so they called his parents.
Whiteid, along with his wife, Michelle Whiteid, traveled from Springfield, Missouri, to Nashville to search for him.
“We talk every day, multiple times a day,” Michelle Whiteid said. “This is the longest I’ve ever gone without talking to him.”
“We’re in a bad dream. Can we wake up? Please, just let us wake up,” her husband told WSMV.
Chris Whiteid told NBC News in an interview on Top Story with Tom Llamas on Tuesday that Strain never made it back to the hotel, and it's out of character for him to not be in touch with their family.
“It’s very odd. Friday night when they got there, he had sent pictures, he called,” Whiteid said. ""Yes, we’re hurting and everything, but right now we’re still expecting a positive outcome.”
Chris Whiteid told the Post-Dispatch that according to security video, it appeared that Strain was heading back to the hotel but took a wrong turn. It's not clear where the video was from.
Searches took place Monday, including a helicopter search of Gay Street, the area where Strain was last seen, the riverbank and a ground search, “but to no avail,” police said.
On Tuesday, police shared security video showing Strain, wearing a two-tone shirt, crossing 1st Avenue North to Gay Street at 9:47 p.m. Friday. That cross-section is about 0.7 miles from the bar he was at earlier.
Strain's family has also been canvassing the area and speaking to the homeless to see if anyone has sighted Strain.
TC Restaurant Group, the operator and owner of Luke’s 32 Bridge, said it, too, was working with police to provide security camera video and other potentially helpful information to aid in the search.
Strain is described as 6-foot-5 with a thin build, blue eyes and light brown hair.
The University of Missouri said in a news release Monday that school officials were alerted over the weekend that Strain was missing after having traveled to Nashville to “attend a private event.”
The school has been in touch with his family and Nashville authorities. It said counseling resources are available to the campus community.
“The safety of our community is our highest priority,” the interim vice chancellor for student affairs, Angela King Taylor, said in a statement. “Our thoughts are with Riley’s family as the search continues. We will be offering any support to them that we can, and we encourage anyone who needs help to reach out to our counseling resources.”
The Delta Chi fraternity said in a statement Monday that it was aware that Strain had been reported missing and that it is “actively engaged” with university officials.
“Delta Chi is hopeful for Riley’s safe return; our thoughts are with his family and the members of the Missouri Chapter during this time,” the organization said.
Anyone who has seen Strain is urged to call Metropolitan Nashville Police at (615)-862-8600.

2024-03-12T16:50:26.042Z,Michelle Yeoh clears up confusing Oscar moment when Emma Stone seemed to ‘ignore’ her,NBC News,"After the internet was fired up about how best actress Oscar winner Emma Stone seemed to ignore Michelle Yeoh while accepting the award, Yeoh addressed the moment on social media on Monday.
Yeoh, who was among several previous winners of the category to present the award to Stone for her role in “Poor Things,” wrote in an Instagram post that she had unwittingly “confused” the newly crowned winner on stage.
Stone had prompted backlash after many thought she had grabbed the Oscar from Yeoh, ignored her and immediately proceeded to greet Jennifer Lawrence, who was next to Yeoh. Video of the moment shows Yeoh handing the award to Stone and then passing it on to Lawrence, with both of them then congratulating Stone.
“Congratulations Emma!! I confused you, but I wanted to share that glorious moment of handing over Oscar to you together with your best friend Jennifer!!” Yeoh wrote on Instagram, alongside pictures of the three of them on stage. “She reminded me of my Bae Jamie Lee Curtis. Always there for each other!!”
Viewers also called out another situation during the ceremony in which Robert Downey Jr. was accepting the best supporting actor Oscar for his work in “Oppenheimer.” Many thought that Downey failed to acknowledge or make eye contact with last year’s winner Ke Huy Quan, who handed the statuette off to him. It led people across the internet to accuse both Stone and Downey of “unconsciously discriminating” against Asians and behaving disrespectfully toward the martial arts icon.
Neither Stone nor Downey and Quan responded to NBC News’ request for comment.
The night ended up being a big one for Yeoh, who was celebrating the one-year anniversary of her own best actress win, which made her the first Asian to take home the category in the Academy’s 95-year history.
“For all the little boys and girls who look like me watching tonight, this is a beacon of hope and possibilities,” Yeoh said in her acceptance speech last year. “This is proof that dreams dream big and dreams do come true.”

2024-03-09T14:48:21.351Z,Mexico-bound plane lands in L.A. in 4th emergency this week for United Airlines,NBC News,"SAN FRANCISCO — A United Airlines jetliner headed to Mexico City from San Francisco made an emergency landing in Los Angeles on Friday after the crew reported a hydraulics issue, in the fourth emergency involving a United Airlines flight this week.
The plane landed safely at Los Angeles International Airport around 4:30 p.m. and none of the 110 people on board were injured, United Airlines said in a statement.
Fire engines stood by at the airport but weren’t needed, said Nicholas Prange, a spokesperson with the Los Angeles City Fire Department.
The airline said passengers can travel to Mexico on another plane expected to depart later Friday.
United said the Airbus A320 has three hydraulic systems for redundancy purposes.
“Preliminary information shows there was only an issue with one system on this aircraft,” it said.
The Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement it will investigate the emergency landing Friday.
The emergency landing at LAX on Friday comes hours after passengers had to be evacuated from another United Airlines flight after the plane rolled off a runway and got stuck in the grass in Houston, Texas. No injuries were reported among the 160 passengers and six crew members, United Airlines said in a statement.
Video posted on social media taken after the landing in Houston showed the plane tilted to one side with one of its wings near the ground.
On Thursday, another United Airlines flight made an emergency landing in Los Angeles. It was a jetliner bound for Japan that lost a tire while taking off from San Francisco. No injuries were reported.
Video footage showed the plane losing one of the six tires on its left-side main landing gear assembly only seconds after takeoff. The tire landed in an employee parking lot at San Francisco International Airport, where it smashed into a car and shattered the back window before breaking through a fence and coming to stop in a neighboring lot.
Earlier in the week, a United flight from Houston to Fort Myers, Texas, was forced to turn around Monday after one of the plane’s engines caught fire. Several of the 167 passengers aboard the Boeing 737 took videos showing a line of flames shooting out of the engine. No injuries were reported.

2024-03-08T21:33:09.112Z,What AI-generated images of Trump surrounded by Black voters mean for this election,NBC News,"Wayne L. Smith, an engineer in the Washington, D.C., area, scoffed at an image he saw last week of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump gleefully nestled among a group of smiling Black people. Seeing the image immediately alarmed him.
“Everything he does to try to get Black people to like him is fake,” Smith said. “Why wouldn’t that photo be fake, too? It just didn’t feel right.”
Smith’s instinct about the photo was correct; it was created by Trump supporter and conservative radio host Mark Kaye, who admitted he used artificial intelligence to create the image and posted it on social media for his 1 million Facebook followers to see. Kaye did not respond to an NBC News request for comment.
“I’m not out there taking pictures of what’s really happening. I’m a storyteller,” Kaye told BBC News, which tracked down the images’ origins. He added, “If anybody’s voting one way or another because of one photo they see on a Facebook page, that’s a problem with that person, not with the post itself.”
Trump’s campaign did not respond to an NBC News request for comment on this article, but last week one campaign official said: “The only ones using AI to meddle in an election are President Trump’s opponents. The Trump Campaign has absolutely nothing to do with these AI images. Nor can we control what other people create and post.”
In this election cycle, Trump has made some headway with Black voters. Sixteen percent of them said in an NBC News poll published in February that they would consider voting for Trump if the election were held today. That’s compared to the 12% who supported Trump in 2020.
Still, this photo generation was the latest in a series of awkward efforts — including claiming he’s being persecuted in the legal system — by Trump, his campaign and his supporters to try to show a connection with Black voters.
“They want our vote but don’t know how to get it,” Smith said. “Biden’s no peach, but he’s not Trump. And they know that. That’s why they are trying anything. Tricks. Deception. And, to me, they’re just making it worse by insulting us.”
On one hand, said  Rhonda Sherrod, who ran for a Democratic Illinois Senate seat this year, these moves to appeal to Black voters rely on racist stereotypes and can be insulting. In a recent NBC News focus group of likely Black voters, participants all generally agreed that Trump’s rhetoric can often be racist.
“I got indicted for nothing, for something that is nothing,” Trump said to a group of Black conservatives last month in South Carolina before the state’s primary. “And a lot of people said that’s why the Black people like me, because they have been hurt so badly and discriminated against, and they actually viewed me as I’m being discriminated against. It’s been pretty amazing but possibly, maybe, there’s something there.”
All the while, these efforts to illustrate Black voters embracing Trump may also  appeal to white voters who have found his previous statements and actions discomforting, said Calvin Lawrence, an IBM chief training officer for responsible and trustworthy AI.
“What about those independent white people who dislike him and won’t vote for him for the mere reason they think he’s a racist?” Lawrence said. “When you see these deep fake videos and images generated by AI with him wrapped up with Black folks, they’re also targeting those white voters and saying, ‘Look. I’m not a racist. He’s not a racist.’ They are using AI on a larger scale.”
Beyond the AI-generated photographs, Trump has also boasted that Black people will connect with him because he has had a mug shot taken.
“My mug shot,” Trump said to the Black conservative group. “We’ve all seen the mug shot, and you know who embraced it more than anybody else? The Black population. You see Black people walking around with my mug shot, you know. They do shirts, and they sell them for $19 apiece. It’s pretty amazing — millions by the way.”
In February Trump unveiled the Never Surrender High-Top Sneaker, a limited edition $399 pair of gold shoes with American flag details, a day after he and his company were ordered to pay a $453 million penalty for real estate fraud. Raymond Arroyo, a Fox News contributor, said in February that Trump’s release of golden sneakers will be attractive to Black voters because “they love sneakers.”
These efforts “are nothing more than bigotry concealed as campaigning,” said Rahna Epting, executive director of the progressive grassroots organization MoveOn. “Black voters have real concerns about tangible issues like the economy, safety and health care.”
Ray Richardson, a retired government worker in Atlanta, agreed. “Donald Trump views me and my Black vote as a cheap whore on the street corner,” Richardson said. “I want passage of the John Lewis Voting Rights Bill, criminal justice reform. He has no regard for my intelligence or interest. It’s insulting and disrespectful.”
For many, the disingenuous use of AI is particularly alarming. Elizabeth M. Adams, an artificial intelligence expert, told NBC News that the images of Trump generated by Kaye using AI is the epitome of “weaponizing or misusing the tool’s purpose.”
But it also was not surprising to Adams, the CEO of EMA Advisory Services, a company that focuses on responsible use of AI.
“Artificial intelligence really is training a computer to think fast, like a human, but at a much faster pace,” she said. “And so, when, in a case like this, it’s being weaponized, it is also a mirror of society. It’s all the things that people think — the biases people have.”
It’s also troubling, Adams said. “Very unfortunate, but it is a consequence of what happens when you don’t have a good vision for how A.I. should be used,” Adams  said via a phone interview from a conference in Saudi Arabia. “If you have bad actors before AI, they’re just going to use the tools and continue being bad actors.”
IBM’s Lawrence wrote a book, published last year, “Hidden in White Sight: How A.I. Empowers and Deepens Systemic Racism.” For the last four years, he said he has been cautioning about the exploitation of AI. With Trump and his supporters, Lawrence said he sees the manifestation of his concerns — and more.
The bigger picture won’t affect Black voters who “know what Trump stands for,” Lawrence said. “The bigger goal is the long-term effect of the deep fake to create a zero trust society, where people no longer believe what you say or what they see. With a zero trust society, you can’t distinguish the truth from falsehood. Truth gets eroded.”
He cited the George Floyd murder in 2020 as an example. “Imagine if the nation thought that woman’s video was a deep fake, thought it was AI-generated?” he said of a bystander’s cellphone video of Floyd’s fatal encounter with Minneapolis police. “If people didn’t believe what they saw, would we have had a social justice movement?”
Half of the responses to questions about politics by AI chatbots like ChatGPT4 and Google Gemini were completely inaccurate, according to an analysis published by the AI Democracy Project last month.
This is only the beginning of AI influx into the election, Adams and Lawrence said. For Chicago psychologist Sherrod, who ran for the state senate this year, that is concerning.
“It’s going to be a bruising political season,” said Sherrod, author of the 2021 book, “Surviving, Healing and Evolving: Essays of Love, Compassion, Healing and Affirmation for Black People.” “In this cycle, the legitimacy of democracy is at stake.”
The volatility of the campaign — with its racial undertones and potential for misleading information, despite some companies having policies against such acts — and the specter of Trump returning to the White House can take a toll on Black voters, Sherrod said.
“From a psychological standpoint, so many of us are already tired. We’ve been bombarded with so much information, and because there are so many different information sources — including AI — that Black people have to protect themselves psychologically,” she said. “A lot of times that means that if you see something that strikes you a certain way, you need to try to look at some other sources of information to figure out whether or not it is credible. It’s a shame we have to go through all those hoops, but that’s the world we live in. But they are worth going through to make sure we get the right person in the White House.”

2024-03-09T21:53:14.016Z,Meghan Markle recounts 'cruel' online bullying during her pregnancies; is keeping distance on social media,NBC News,"Meghan Markle said she experienced “cruel” online bullying while she was pregnant with both of her children.
Speaking on a panel at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas, on Friday, Markle said she is keeping her “distance from [social media] right now just for my own well-being.”
The “bulk” of the social media and online “bullying and abuse” she said she has experienced was when she was pregnant with her children, Archie and Lilibet, and while she had a newborn.
Markle had her first child with Prince Harry, Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, on May 6, 2019.
The couple then welcomed Lilibet “Lili” Diana Mountbatten-Windsor two years later, on June 4, 2021.
“You really wrap your head around why people would be so hateful,” Markle said of the social media bullying she experienced. “It’s not catty, it’s cruel.”
Markle acknowledged that there is “so much work to be done in terms of keeping people safe” in the current social media landscape, especially considering what children are exposed to, while also appreciating the dichotomy that can exist on social media platforms.
Using the panel, which was being streamed on YouTube, as an example, Markle said it’s “fantastic” that it’s on the video platform because people are going to “have access to hear all of this brilliance and all of this insight,” but “at the same time, it’s a platform that has quite a bit of hate and rhetoric and incentivizes people to create pages where they can churn out very, very inciting comments and conspiracy theories that can have a tremendously negative effect on someone’s mental health, their physical safety.”
She also called out “how much of the hate is women completely spewing that to other women.”
Markle said there are a lot of women in high-level executive positions “who are great champions of women, who are great philanthropists,” and yet “they’re allowing this kind of behavior to run rampant.”
“At a certain point, they have got to put the ‘dos’ behind the ‘says’ and really make some changes on a systemic level,” Markle said.
But, she added, average social media users also have work to do to ensure safe spaces online, noting that the “systemic change has to happen at the same time as the cultural change is happening,” calling out women who are “reading something terrible, terrible about a woman” and then sharing it.
“I think that is the piece that is so lost right now, and what’s happening in the digital space and in certain sectors in the media — we have forgotten about our humanity,” Markle said.
“And that has got to change, because I understand there’s a bottom line, and I understand that a lot of money is being made there, but even if it’s making dollars, it doesn’t make sense.”
Markle and Prince Harry relocated to California in 2020, giving up their life in England and stepping back from the British royal family. They have since been outspoken about how the press, particularly paparazzi, has infiltrated their lives in both the U.S. and the U.K.

The gold 1966 Chevrolet Impala was found about 8 to 10 feet below the surface of the Pecatonica River, Winnebago County Sheriff Gary Caruana said at a news conference on Wednesday.
The vehicle is linked to the nearly 50-year cold case of Clarence Owens, 65, and Everette Hawley, 75, who went missing on Feb. 19, 1976.
They were last seen at a farm auction near the Winnebago-Ogle County line and had been driving a gold 1966 Chevrolet Impala at the time they vanished, according to authorities.
Fishermen were using sonar equipment to look for the best fishing hole when they came across what they believed was a car, Caruana told reporters.
On Monday, a dive team went out to the river to retrieve the vehicle.
Human skeletal remains as well as personal items were also found.
Jennifer Muraski, the Winnebago County coroner, said a bone was located inside the vehicle and several other bones were found along the river bank.
""What we do have right now is what looks to be human skeletal remains of two individuals. We do not know if these individuals are female or male at this point. We are in the infancy stages of the investigation as far as who this might be,"" the coroner said.
Over 100 skeletal remains have been recovered, Muraski said. Teams were going back out to the river to see if more could be recovered.
Muraski said once the office has everything that can be recovered, they will work with a forensic anthropologist and the family to ""see if there’s any injury to these skeletal remains.""
""Can we tell the story of what might have happened to them via their remains,"" she said. ""And also DNA, who are they?”
The sheriff said as of now, investigators are ""working on no foul play because there’s many theories here that we can go on.""
""At this time we're still working on that it's a missing person's report, a missing person's case,"" he said. ""But I will ask the public to give us some tips.""

2024-03-12T21:11:49.484Z,"Florida man suspected in disappearance of girlfriend's daughter, 13, faces 60 new sex crime charges",NBC News,"The boyfriend of the mother of Madeline Soto, the 13-year-old Florida girl who was found dead in a wooded area this month, faces 60 new charges that span sexual battery to possession of child pornography, authorities said Tuesday.
Stephan Sterns, 37, whom the Orange County Sheriff's Office previously described as ""the prime suspect"" in Madeline’s disappearance, was hit with the fresh charges Monday, from the State Attorney’s Office for the Ninth Judicial Circuit said in a news release.
He has not been charged in connection with the girl's death.
Madeline’s mother reported her missing Feb. 26 after she went to pick her up from school and learned that she never made it.
Sterns was arrested Feb. 28 on charges of sexual battery and possession of child sexual abuse material after detectives found “disturbing images” and videos that were “criminal, and sexual in nature,” on his phone, the sheriff's office said.
During the search for Madeline, Sterns was interviewed by law enforcement and consented to having his phone searched, an arrest affidavit said. He told authorities he accidentally factory reset it the day Madeline vanished, according to the affidavit.
However, a forensic examination of the phone led authorities to discover the images, prompting his arrest. The arrest affidavit did not name Madeline but said the images found depicted ""the missing juvenile.""
Further investigation led to the discovery of more images showing criminal acts, leading to the new charges, authorities said.
He now faces eight counts of sexual battery on a child under 12, five counts of sexual battery with a child 12 to 18 (familial/custodial authority), seven counts of lewd or lascivious molestation and 40 counts of unlawful possession of materials depicting sexual performance by a child 10 or more images, the news release said.
Court documents filed Monday, which blocked out the name of the victim, indicate that the crimes dated to 2019, several of them having taken place when the victim was under age 12.
“The State Attorney’s Office has been working closely with KPD and received evidence that gave us cause to file formal charges against Sterns,"" State Attorney Andrew A. Bain said in a statement, referring to the Kissimmee Police Department, the lead agency in the murder investigation. ""We appreciate the thoroughness and detailed attention of their investigation and will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to build a strong case against the defendant.”
Sexual battery on a child under 12 is a felony punishable by life in prison if a defendant is convicted, prosecutors said.
Sterns is being held in the Osceola County Jail. His arraignment is set for April 2.
The public defender's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It was not clear Sterns has been assigned an attorney.
It is believed that she was killed in Kissimmee, where her family lived in an apartment, and that Sterns moved her body early Feb. 26, Orange County Sheriff John Mina has said.
Madeline’s body was found March 1. No details about how she died have been released.

2024-03-08T23:55:44.654Z,Florida man charged with murder in death of gay man at dog park,NBC News,"A man has been arrested and charged with murder in connection to a shooting at a Tampa dog park last month that led to the death of a 52-year-old gay man, Florida prosecutors said Friday.
Gerald Declan Radford, 65, was charged with second-degree murder for the deadly shooting of John Walter Lay, which Radford initially alleged was in self-defense, according to the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office. Prosecutors said their investigation revealed that Radford used bigoted slurs toward the victim prior to shooting him and are seeking a hate crime enhancement on the charge.
“We should all be able to enjoy a day at the dog park without the fear of gunfire. This victim also deserved to live free from fear and discrimination based on his sexual orientation,” Florida State Attorney Suzy Lopez said in a statement. “The evidence shows the defendant’s actions were motivated by hate, and he will be held accountable. My heart is with the victim’s family and large group of friends as we fight for justice together.”
Radford is expected to appear in court Saturday, according to Erin Maloney, a spokesperson for Lopez. Information about an attorney for Radford was not immediately available.
LGBTQ advocates welcomed the charges, but criticized state law that protects individuals from facing prosecution for a homicide if they claim they killed someone in order to defend themselves, also known as a “stand your ground” law.
“With the arrest of Gerald Declan Radford, the question of guilt moves to the courts, but the verdict is already in on Florida’s notorious Stand Your Ground law: This law doesn’t just fail to protect; it actively endangers, turning what should be last-resort measures into first instincts, with tragic outcomes,” LGBTQ advocacy group Equality Florida said in a statement. “The absence of a duty to retreat to safety is too often exploited to justify murder without consequence.”
Lopez’s office noted in a news release Friday the frustration some felt regarding the length of time it took for the charges to be brought, roughly a month.
“It is important to note how difficult it can be to refute a Stand Your Ground claim in some cases because the only other witness to the incident is deceased,” the release said. “Throughout the course of this investigation, community members stepped forward with important information about ongoing tensions that helped add context to the incident.”
The day before the shooting, Lay filmed a video that he shared with friends, suggesting that Radford was threatening to harm him. This helped prosecutors make their case for the charges, the release said. It’s unclear how Lay and Radford knew each other prior to the incident.

2024-03-08T21:00:12.821Z,Mountain lion spotted on camera roaming through the streets of a California coastal city,NBC News,"Oceanside police have confirmed the recent sightings of a mountain lion prowling the streets of Oceanside this week.
The mountain lion was spotted in several areas of the city — including looking through the windows of an Oceanside movie theater — sometime between Monday and Wednesday night, Oceanside police Officer Tom Bussey said. Sightings were reported along State Route 76 at Rancho Del Oro near Ivey Ranch Park; in the 200 and 300 block of North Coast Highway near the Oceanside City Hall; and in the 1100 block of South Coast Highway.
Surveillance footage captured the mountain lion walking through a courtyard and by a parking garage near Oceanside City Hall, according to Officer Bussey.
If you see mountain lions, do not approach or disturb them, the Oceanside Police Department and California Department of Fish and Wildlife said. Avoid the mountain lion and report the sighting to police immediately by calling 760-435-4911.
If you call the department, be prepared to give the location and time of the sighting.
Police already contacted the California Department of Fish and Wildlife regarding the recent sightings. The department is monitoring the situation in collaboration with police.
If the mountain lion becomes aggressive, hostile or is seen near a school or park, please call 911 immediately, the department said.
As their name states, mountain lions prefer the mountains and it’s very unusual to see them in city streets like Oceanside. They prefer some dense vegetation for cover, which they find in the coastal sage scrub of Southern California, according to Megan Senour, human wildlife conflict specialist at the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.
She said it appears this mountain lion ended up in downtown Oceanside through “wildlife corridors.” Wildlife doesn’t see property boundaries the way humans do, Senour added.
“So they use what we call wildlife corridors. So nice green spaces, drainages, anything like that. That’s the kind of path of least resistance, and they’ll use those to travel along, find resources, all things like that. And so that’s likely what this animal used to kind of access that more urban downtown area,” she told NBC San Diego.
Human contact with mountain lions are very uncommon, Senour said.
“Those interactions are incredibly rare, but certainly there are things that we can do as members of the public when we live and recreate in mountain lion country. Half of the state is considered mountain lion habitat,” she said.
If you’re going to be moving around, such as hiking or camping in mountain lion country, Senour suggests going with another person or in a group, make noise, talk, or play music to avoid a surprise interaction, which is usually when those interactions occur.
“A lot of folks recreate in mountain lion country without incidents. So it really is — to emphasize — it’s incredibly rare for there to be even an interaction in general. Mountain lions want to avoid us just as much as we want to avoid them. They don’t want to see us — the weird two legged hairless creatures walking around. We’re just as odd for them as they are for us for seeing them,” she said.
Most mountain lion interactions do tend to involve pets or small animals, according to Senour.
Make sure you’re not letting your pets into the backyard by themselves and are closely monitoring them, keeping them on leashes and indoors whenever possible, she said.
“We typically have rule of thumb for leash walking is nothing that’s longer than 6ft and it’s non retractable,” Senour said.
Mountain lions have a huge range, says Andy Blue with the Ramona Wildlife Center.
“They can cover 10 to 12 miles a day, and their range is actually about 100 square miles. So if they’re seeing cats fairly close to the urban areas, that’s probably a cat that is also on Camp Pendleton and Fallbrook and some of these other more open, wooded areas. But it is unusual to see them in an area with a lot of people and in neighborhoods, certainly,” he said.
Does it seem like more wildlife are heading into town lately? It might just be modern technology.
“One thing we’re seeing more of here with Project Wildlife is there’s quite a bit more wildlife being seen with the addition of a lot of people have Ring cameras and setups like that around their house. And so we’re seeing a lot more wildlife that we haven’t seen in the past, and they’ve probably been in these areas all along, and we just were never really were aware of it until you’re seeing it on your camera in the middle of the night,” Blue said.
He has a special warning for pet owners.
“First and foremost is if you don’t feed your pets outside your dogs or cats, that’s what attracts a lot of animals that some of the animals, like coyotes and mountain lions, prey on. So if you’re putting out dog and cat food overnight and a raccoon is coming around, mountain lions will prey on raccoons or coyotes or rabbits or squirrels. So everything from dog and cat food to compost piles to bird feeders to bird fountains, all these things that attract wildlife to your home. It’s nice to see the animals, but it’s not fair to them because you’re attracting them into an area where they may be predated,” Blue added.

2024-03-13T06:53:42.166Z,"Seavey now has the most Iditarod wins, but Alaska's historic race is marred by 3 sled dog deaths",NBC News,"ANCHORAGE, Alaska — Alaska’s annual Iditarod dog sled race ended with a victory for the ages: One of the biggest names in the sport came from behind after a moose attack to win the grueling, dayslong contest for an unprecedented sixth time.
But Dallas Seavey’s record-setting win late Tuesday was overshadowed by the deaths of three dogs in this year’s storied endurance race across the Alaska wilderness, and renewed calls from an animal rights group to stop the race. A fourth dog, one of Seavey’s, was severely injured by a moose on the trail.
Seavey, 37, finished the 51st Iditarod in 9 days, 2 hours, 16 minutes and 8 seconds and won just over $55,000 for first place. As he neared the finish line, he jumped off his sled and ran with his dogs, pumping his fists. After he reached the finish line, he hugged each dog on his team — and they gave him sloppy dog kisses as they sat on the winner’s podium.
“This one was supposed to be hard,” Seavey told the crowd. “It had to be special, it had to be more than just a normal Iditarod, and for me, it was.”
The Iditarod Trail Dog Sled Race takes human-and-dog teams across 1,000 miles of wilderness on a trail that traverses two mountain ranges, the Yukon River and a slice of the frozen Bering Sea before ending in the Gold Rush town of Nome just south of the Arctic Circle.
But the deaths of the dogs on three separate teams, two led by rookie mushers and a third in his second Iditarod, cast a pall over the race as the Iditarod ended a five-year streak without a dog death. Five dogs also died and eight were injured in collisions with snow machines during training before the race on shared-use trails.
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, the loudest critic of the Iditarod, called for officials to end the contest once and for all.
“The Iditarod is the shame of Alaska,” PETA Executive Vice President Tracy Reiman said in a statement. “How many more dogs need to die before this stops? Dogs’ lives are worth more than this.”
The Iditarod did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Mushers Issac Teaford, of Salt Lake City, and Hunter Keefe, of Knik, both voluntarily quit the course after their dogs died, or they would have risked being removed by the race marshal, per Iditarod rules.
The third dog on rookie Calvin Daugherty’s team collapsed on the trail about 10 miles before reaching the checkpoint in the village of Shaktoolik. A necropsy is planned, and Daugherty also scratched.
A moose severely injured one of Seavey’s dogs in an attack on the trail early on. Seavey shot and killed the moose with a handgun and gutted it. Race rules require any big game animal killed in defense of life or property to be gutted before the musher moves on. But because he spent only 10 minutes gutting the moose, race officials gave Seavey a two-hour time penalty.
Seavey and his team battled back, and by Tuesday morning they had a three-hour lead over their nearest competitor before sweeping to victory later in the day.
“When you look back at 1,000 miles of what these dogs just covered, the challenges they faced, you can’t swallow that in one bite, but we can have one good step at a time,” he said of his dogs. “And if you can keep doing that, it leads to something.”
Seavey’s name is found throughout the Iditarod record book. In 2005, he became the youngest musher to run in the race, and in 2012, its youngest champion.
Seavey also won Iditarod championships in 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2021. He had previously been tied with now-retired musher Rick Swenson with five titles apiece. Swenson won the Iditarod in 1977, 1979, 1981, 1982 and 1991.
Seavey’s family history is deeply entwined with the Iditarod. His grandfather, Dan Seavey, helped organize and ran the first Iditarod in 1973, and his father, Mitch Seavey, is a three-time champion.
Dallas Seavey almost took a different path in the sports world. He was the first Alaskan to win a USA national wrestling championship when he took the 125-pound Gregco-Roman title in 2003 and trained for a year at the U.S. Olympic Training Center before concussions led him to back to mushing.
The Iditarod started March 2 for 38 mushers with a ceremonial run in Anchorage, followed by the competitive start on March 3 in Willow, about 75 miles north of Anchorage. Seven mushers dropped out of the race this year.

2024-03-13T04:48:27.408Z,"Retired UFC fighter Mark Coleman hospitalized after rescuing parents from house fire, manager says",NBC News,"Retired UFC fighter Mark Coleman was in an induced coma in intensive care after he rescued his parents from a house fire in Toledo, Ohio, early Tuesday, his manager said.
Despite the urgent medical attention, family members, including Coleman's rescued mother, believe he will pull through, manager Michael DiSabato said late Tuesday.
The blaze took place around 4 a.m. when Coleman was awakened by the barking of the family's dog, Hammer, which prompted him to pull his father and then his mother out of the burning home, DiSabato said, adding that Coleman's family said the fire began in the kitchen.
Coleman, 59, went in a third time to rescue Hammer but was unsuccessful, and the dog died, he said.
It wasn't clear whether Coleman collapsed inside or outside the home. DiSabato said that the roof collapsed when the first firefighters arrived and that Coleman suffered from the effects of smoke inhalation.
He was rushed to a Toledo hospital by helicopter, DiSabato said. His parents were not seriously injured.
Daughter Morgan Coleman said on Instagram that he was “fighting for his life.”
Coleman's mother, Connie Foos Coleman, had a hopeful tone on Facebook late Tuesday: ""I am going to bed! Thank God we are alive. Prayers for Mark ! Thank you to all the firefighters. And sheriffs dept. EMS Red Cross. and especially my family. Could not do this without you!""
Fire officials did not immediately respond to a request for information.
DiSabato sent photos of the home, which was nearly burned to the ground. What was left of the residence was completely charred.
Coleman was one of the UFC's earlier breakout stars, having started in 1996, the year Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., described the sport as ""human cockfighting.""
Coleman and contemporaries like Randy Couture helped professionalize the sport and expand it, even as they dazzled crowds with some tools better suited to street fighting.
Coleman's UFC record was 16-10-0 in the four years he fought in the organization. He also fought for Pride Fighting Championships, winning the promotion's Grand Prix tournament in 2000.
Before he switched to mixed martial arts, Coleman was a standout amateur wrestler, winning an NCAA championship at Ohio State in 1988 and competing at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain.
He later had stints in the world of scripted professional wrestling.

2024-03-11T16:56:02.233Z,"MLB sees slowly improving diversity in its youth pipeline, despite record-low number of Black major leaguers",NBC News,"For much of Lee Allen Jr.’s childhood, baseball seemed quite far from him.
Major League Baseball’s Royals played in his hometown Kansas City, Missouri, but Allen — who is Black and lived in the inner city — didn’t come across many baseball opportunities until late in his high school years.
In January 2020, a 17-year-old Allen was invited to one of MLB’s development programs, the DREAM Series, where for the first time he was put in front of scouts and coaches to display his skills in a competitive environment.
Four years later, Allen stood on the field at the Jackie Robinson Training Complex in Vero Beach, Florida, wearing a purple, white and gold baseball uniform representing the historically Black college Prairie View A&M University, his eyes set on a pro career.
More than 200 HBCU standouts were there for MLB’s Andre Dawson Classic, a collegiate tournament for players hoping to one day crack the major leagues — and perhaps help usher in a new generation of African American stars.
“Being able to be out here and showcase my talents in front of these scouts and other guys who’s looking at us at the next level,” said Allen, now a junior infielder for the Panthers, “it feels great for me because I know that those are goals that I can reach, and they’re there.”
That’s MLB’s aim as it faces historically low numbers of Black players in the majors. A study done by The Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport at Central Florida found African American players represented just 6.2% of players on MLB opening day rosters in 2023, down from 7.2% in 2022. Both figures were the lowest since the study began in 1991, when 18% of MLB players were Black.
That’s also the lowest percentage of African American participation among four of the five major professional sports — NBA, NFL, MLB, MLS — outside of the National Hockey League, where more than 90% of its players are white. MLB has tried to address that with a series of grassroots diversity initiatives.
“We are really doubling down on what we’ve done,” said Del Matthews, MLB’s vice president of baseball development, “because we are producing kids that are going to college, that are getting internships within the sport. We see more kids playing at the Division I college baseball ranks, and we see more kids being drafted into the minor leagues. And so we’re just flooding that through the various programs that we’ve had.”
There are signs of progress at the pro level. Between 2012 and 2021, 17.4% of first-round picks were African American players. That number spiked to 30% in 2022, when four of the first five selections were Black players for the first time ever — and all four were alumni of at least one MLB diversity initiative. In 2023, Black players made up 10 of the first 50 draft selections, or 20%.
Those gains haven’t bolstered MLB numbers yet, and even in the minors, Black participation has been slow to rise. When MLB recently announced rosters for its Spring Breakout exhibitions showcasing top minor league prospects, 9.5% of the players were Black — including 31 alums of MLB’s diversity programs.
MLB’s pipeline begins with an annual tour of pro-style camps in various cities across the country to identify baseball potential among inner city kids. The tour has grown each year — from 12 stops when it launched in 2018 to 18 cities now — and targets kids around 13-14 years old, just before they enter high school.
The goal is to eventually send those players to more advanced development programs, where they can get significant reps playing competitive baseball — mostly cost-free — and create relationships with pro scouts and former major leaguers that can help them down the line.
“The sport has gotten so expensive that it has eliminated a lot of our kids,” said Jerry Manuel, a former manager for the White Sox and Mets. “So we’ve got to do everything we can to get them back in the pipeline.”
The programs are mostly funded through USA Baseball, the sport’s governing body in the United States, which pays for equipment, meals and potential travel for showcases that Matthews estimated could otherwise cost upward of $700 per event. Anywhere from 1,200 to 1,500 kids are selected each year to participate in MLB’s diversity-focused programming, including the DREAM Series, Breakthrough Series, the Hank Aaron Invitational and girls baseball/softball events. Some players attend several events per year — an opportunity that otherwise wouldn’t be feasible for many kids from lower-income families.
That’s why Sheila Moreno was grateful that her son Jadin’s introduction to baseball was through the Houston Astros’ free youth baseball league, one of more than 180 organizations affiliated with MLB’s Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities (RBI) outreach program that targets kids in underserved communities.
Jadin wants to play professional baseball overseas, Moreno said, but knowing how expensive the sport can be, she worried that expenses would hinder him before he even got his start. When Moreno came across the RBI Houston program, that gave Jadin the connections he needed to earn invites to other development showcases. He’s now a junior infielder at Prairie View.
“He didn’t have to pay anything,” Moreno said at the Andre Dawson Classic last month, “so it was very helpful. All he wanted to do was play ball. He was just looking for someone to help him with the basic skills and to put effort into him.”
The league said nearly 700 alumni of its development programs have gone on to play college baseball, with around 90% of those players being Black.
In Division I, 752 men’s baseball players — about 6% — are Black, according to the NCAA’s demographics database. That’s the highest that number has been in the last 10 years and reflects small but steady growth that MLB Chief Baseball Development Officer Tony Reagins said shows improvement in the pipeline.
Reagins added that the advocacy of former Black major leaguers like Manuel has been especially helpful in showing aspiring pros what is possible.
One of those MLB hopefuls is Termarr Johnson, who chose baseball over basketball and football — sports he said were more popular growing up in Atlanta. He participated in almost every diversity initiative MLB offered and was connected with mentors like Manuel, Ken Griffey Jr., Dave Winfield and Marquis Grissom — some of whom he can call on a whim for advice.
Johnson was the fourth overall pick in the 2022 draft. Standing in the Pittsburgh Pirates’ clubhouse before a recent big league spring training game, Johnson credited those programs for developing him on and off the field.
“The biggest thing that was helpful was them tackling the mental piece of what it takes to be a big leaguer, a great big leaguer,” Johnson said. “Them telling me little things like, ‘Tuck in your shirt when you’re out on the field. Make sure you run off the field.’ A scout sees that, people see that.”
Johnson has impressed so far as the Pirates’ No. 2 overall prospect, and he’s started his own kids camp, hoping it inspires more Black kids to play the game and stick with it, like MLB’s programs were for him.
“I don’t know if I’d be here right now if it wasn’t for that,” Johnson said.

2024-03-13T19:21:31.680Z,Jury in James Crumbley trial weighing fate of school shooter's father after closing arguments,NBC News,"Jury deliberations began Wednesday afternoon in the involuntary manslaughter trial of James Crumbley, whose alleged failure to safely store a gun allowed his teenage son to kill four students in a 2021 school shooting in suburban Detroit.
During closing arguments in a Michigan courtroom, Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald played a frantic 911 call placed by Crumbley after the rampage saying he ""raced home"" to check on the weapon and she reminded the jury that he told investigators he hid a semi-automatic handgun in an armoire and placed the ammunition underneath jeans in another drawer. Crumbley bought the 9 mm Sig Sauer, which came with a cable lock, four days before the shooting as a present for his then-15-year-old son, Ethan.
""Here's something you never hear him say,"" McDonald said. ""He never says, 'I can't imagine how he got a hold of this gun.' Four kids just died, your son is in custody and not once did he say, 'How did he get the gun?' And you know why he didn't say it? He didn't say it because he already knew.""
The prosecution offered that the deaths were ""preventable and foreseeable"" if Crumbley had done any number of ""tragically small efforts,"" and McDonald attempted to undercut the defense by telling jurors that parents can be responsible gun owners no matter if their child is planning a mass shooting.
""It couldn't happen simply because you purchased a firearm,"" she said, adding, ""Beware of the claim 'this could be you.'""
A 12-member jury must decide if Crumbley, 47, is guilty of involuntary manslaughter by either failing to store the firearm in a way that would have obstructed his son from gaining access to the gun and ammunition, or failing to exercise ""reasonable care"" of his son and prevent him from carrying out the mass shooting.
The unusual case largely mirrors that against his wife, Jennifer Crumbley, who last month became the first parent in the U.S. held criminally responsible for a mass school shooting committed by their child. She will be sentenced in April on the same four counts of involuntary manslaughter and faces up to 15 years in prison per count.
Ethan pleaded guilty as an adult in the deaths of the four students — Justin Shilling, 17; Madisyn Baldwin, 17; Tate Myre, 16; and Hana St. Juliana, 14 — and was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. He did not testify in either parents' trial.
Defense lawyer Mariell Lehman said in her closing argument that the prosecution had to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt and that it presented no evidence to show Crumbley knew his son was a danger to the public or that he had access to the gun.
""But you didn't see it because it isn't true,"" Lehman said. ""James didn't know. This can be your reasonable doubt.""
The race toward the trial's end came as Crumbley told Oakland County Circuit Court Judge Cheryl Matthews earlier Wednesday that he wouldn't take the stand, and ""it is my decision to remain silent.""
Instead, the jury heard from a single defense witness — his sister, Karen Crumbley — who testified that she had seen her brother and Ethan when the siblings' mother died in early 2021, several months before the shooting. She said she had not noticed anything ""concerning"" about Ethan's behavior, nor when she visited her brother in Michigan about four months before the shooting.
Karen Crumbley, who lives in Florida, said she communicated with her brother often, although they reside in different states, and testified that it would be wrong to get a gun for a child to ""use at his leisure,"" but with adult supervision, ""I don't see any problem with it.""
During cross-examination, however, Assistant Oakland County Prosecutor Marc Keast confirmed with her that the siblings only spoke with each other three times by phone in 2021 and shared 22 instant messages, suggesting they were not close.
On Tuesday, Crumbley appeared emotional when video from the shooting at Oxford High School was played for jurors.
The father averted his eyes from the video, which did not include audio, and also wiped away tears when Oakland County Sheriff's Office Detective Lt. Tim Willis testified how Ethan fatally shot four students days after Thanksgiving with a semi-automatic handgun purchased by his father as an early Christmas gift.
""We had no idea what we were responding to. My police radio was blowing up with calls,"" Willis said of the day of the shooting. ""It was chaos,"" he added.
Oakland County prosecutors called 15 witnesses in Crumbley's trial, fewer than the 21 witnesses called in the trial of his wife.
James Crumbley's trial hinges on a similar accusation that, as Ethan's parent, he knew of his son's mental state and that he had access to firearms. Prosecutors allege he was still ""grossly negligent"" by failing to prevent the shooting deaths. He is not accused of knowing about the attack beforehand, which his son had warned about in journals.
Willis shared messages the shooter wrote over the months and days leading up to the massacre, including, ""My parents won't listen to me about help or a therapist""; ""I will have to find where my dad hid my 9 mm before I can shoot the school""; and ""I have access to the gun and the ammo. I am fully committed this to now.""
Much of the evidence presented and the witnesses called by the prosecution paralleled the case against Jennifer Crumbley.
But James Crumbley's trial has moved at a faster clip and with stark differences.
On the same day as opening statements last Thursday, Matthews signed a court order revoking Crumbley's jail phone and electronic messages — except for his lawyer or legitimate clergy or for using his tablet for research — after he allegedly made ""threatening statements"" of an undisclosed nature.
During her trial, Jennifer Crumbley did choose to testify, telling jurors that she regretted her son's actions, but that ultimately she ""wouldn't have"" done anything differently in how she parented him — testimony that was analyzed by her jury during its deliberations.
Jennifer Crumbley's personal life also became a central factor in how the prosecution chose to pick apart her parenting, calling on the man with whom she was having an extramarital affair to testify and focusing on how she paid attention to her hobbies over responding to her son's text messages. Prosecutors also called co-workers of Jennifer Crumbley, who was a marketing director for a real estate company.
Jennifer Crumbley testified that she entrusted her husband with securing the family's firearms, including the gun used by her son, but not with other duties, such as holding down a job, handling money or even getting out of bed on time.
Jurors learned that James Crumbley had been working as a DoorDash driver around the time of the shooting and would take his son to the shooting range. In text messages with a friend several months before the shooting, Ethan wrote that he was experiencing ""bad insomnia"" and paranoia and suggested that he had reached out to his parents and specifically asked his father to take him to the doctor.
""He just gave me some pills and told me to 'Suck it up,'"" Ethan texted.
He also sent his friend a video of him holding a gun about three months before the shooting. ""My dad left it out so I thought, 'Why not' lol,"" Ethan wrote.
Similar to his wife's trial, Crumbley's actions on the day of the shooting were widely discussed in testimony. That morning, the Crumbleys were summoned to Ethan's school after a teacher found his math homework with a drawing of a gun, a person shot and messages, including: ""The thoughts won't stop. Help me.""
Nicholas Ejak, Oxford High School's dean of students at the time of the shooting, testified this week that James Crumbley told his son at the meeting that he had people he could talk to and that he could write in his journal.
""He expressed concern for his son,"" Ejak said.
But both parents declined to take Ethan home and neither warned the school he had access to a gun; the teen would go on to commit the shooting later that day.
On cross-examination, Lehman got Ejak to confirm that he did not think Ethan was an immediate threat nor initially believe that he was the shooter despite the disturbing drawing that was found and knowledge that a teacher had also caught Ethan looking at bullets on his phone in class a day earlier.
""In no way did you feel that Mr. Crumbley was being neglectful of his son?"" Lehman asked Ejak, who also testified at Jennifer Crumbley's trial.
""No, I did not,"" Ejak said.
Lehman also pushed back at Willis, the investigating detective, who testified about what Ethan wrote in his journal about getting access to the gun.
""You don't recall reading anything that says, 'My dad told me where the gun and ammo were'?"" Lehman asked. Willis agreed he hadn't.
During the trial, Crumbley has used an over-the-ear device to help with his hearing, which Lehman mentioned during her closing argument Wednesday, leading the prosecution to object.
Lehman emphasized that Crumbley, ultimately, did hide the gun used by his son because Ethan wrote as much in his journal.
""If it really were his son's gun why was it hidden in James' bedroom,"" she said, ""in a location that his son wasn't aware of.""
But in her rebuttal closing argument, McDonald left jurors with a quick action meant to leave an impression: She held up a cable lock and threaded it through a handgun to make the weapon secure.
""That takes less than 10 seconds,"" she said.

2024-03-08T22:22:09.943Z,Democrat running for Uvalde House seat blasts report on school shooting,NBC News,"A Democrat running to represent Uvalde, Texas, in Congress blasted the latest report into the 2022 school shooting as an insult to grieving families and criticized one of his Republican rivals as a would-be “Rambo” who is a poor role model for teenagers.
Santos Limon, who won Tuesday’s Democratic primary for the state’s 23rd District, spoke Friday in a wide-ranging phone interview about the election, the Uvalde mass shooting, the role of Elon Musk in Texas politics and other subjects.
Limon faces an uphill fight in the West Texas district, which Republicans have represented for years, but he said he likes his odds because of his own conservative views and because Republicans are sharply divided. Republicans will decide their nominee in a May 28 runoff primary between the incumbent, Tony Gonzales, and Brandon Herrera, a popular creator of gun videos for YouTube.
Guns are a major subject in the race in part because the district includes Uvalde. Nineteen students and two teachers died at the town’s Robb Elementary School nearly two years ago.
On Thursday, the Uvalde City Council published its report into the massacre and the delayed law enforcement response. The report said there was no evidence of police wrongdoing or failure to follow training, and it criticized parents who tried to get into the building during the shooting.
Parents and residents responded to the report with anger and disbelief at a council meeting with Jesse Prado, an Austin-based investigator who wrote the City Council’s report.
Limon said the residents were justified in their anger.
“He was blaming the parents because they were making chaos outside and, again, there was close to 400 officers inside that building while kids were being massacred,” he said.
An earlier federal investigation was much harsher on local law enforcement than the Prado report was, saying children’s lives may have been saved if officers had responded differently.
Limon said Prado, who did not take questions at Thursday’s council meeting, was disrespectful.
“He didn’t even have the decency to take off his cowboy hat in a room full of people that are still grieving,” Limon said. “It’s an insult to the victims and to the survivors.”
Some news coverage of the meeting took note of the fact that Prado did not remove his hat.
In a phone interview Friday, Prado said he kept his hat on indoors so he could see. He said he’s had several surgeries that sometimes cause him to see a halo.
“There was no intention to insult anyone,” he said. “I really wanted to see the people that were speaking.” He declined to comment on the 182-page report.
Limon said he’d favor a national version of a Florida law barring people under age 21 from buying a gun. Florida passed the law in 2018 after the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland. The Uvalde shooter bought his gun as an 18-year-old.
“How is it that a state so Republican like Florida is able to pass a gun bill?” Limon asked. “Why don’t they do that here in Texas? Or why don’t they do that across the country?”
He said he’s frustrated that the U.S. has been debating school shootings since the 1999 Columbine High School massacre with no obvious progress to show for it.
“It’s the same topics over and over and over and over. No one’s listening to our constituents, and they’ve caught on,” he said.
Guns have also been a topic in the Republican primary in the 23rd District. Gonzales was one of 14 House Republicans to vote for a gun safety law after Uvalde, while Herrera has condemned provisions of the law as unconstitutional. Herrera calls himself a Second Amendment “absolutist.”
Herrera, through a spokesperson, declined an interview request Friday. Gonzales did not respond to interview requests Wednesday or Friday.
Herrera has risen to popularity on the success of YouTube, where he posts videos about firearms including machine guns to 3.2 million subscribers. Using the nickname “The AK Guy,” Herrera makes and often praises the Kalashnikov-style rifles that originated in the Soviet Union.
Limon said Herrera reminded him of the Rambo movies starring Sylvester Stallone.
“It’s like watching Rambo ‘First Blood’ when he was out there with that .50-caliber gun,” he said. “Is that what our teenagers need to see? Our high school graduates, are they going to vote for a guy like that?”
Herrera imitates and talks about the Rambo character in at least one of his YouTube videos where he fires an M60 machine gun.
Limon, 50, has never run for office before, though he said as a 14-year-old he dreamed of being a mayor. He grew up in Del Rio, Texas, and now lives in San Antonio, working as a civil engineer on railroad projects.
He said he thinks his views are a match for the district that stretches from El Paso to the San Antonio area.
“I am a conservative Democrat. I’m an entrepreneur. I am pro-business. I am pro-choice. I am pro-Israel. I am pro-union. I am pro-teachers. I’m against [school] vouchers. I’m against charter schools,” he said.
Limon said that, like Republicans, he’s upset about the level of illegal immigration across the U.S.-Mexico border. He said he favors relocating more immigration judges closer to the border so they can work more efficiently, and he criticized Republican immigration proposals as hollow.
“There are Republican friends who are using it as a stage,” he said of the border and specifically the city Eagle Pass.
The immigration issue has helped to pull Musk into the race. The CEO of SpaceX and Tesla appeared last year with Gonzales at the border, and Musk has become a rising figure in Texas politics as he has moved more of business operations to the state.
Limon said he considers Musk a “visionary” who could bring greater economic development to his district, but he also said politicians have failed to keep pace with Musk and other executives who have pursued swift technological change.
“They’re way ahead with their vision. We need someone to stay right parallel to them,” he said.
He said, for example, that he’d like to slow down deployment of self-driving big rigs and instead invest resources in infrastructure projects including for freight and passenger rail.
“Third World countries are catching up to our country because we keep playing politics,” he said. “All of us are fighting against each other while everybody else in the world is constructing and building.”

2024-03-08T18:06:35.435Z,"Rupert Murdoch, 92, is engaged for the sixth time",NBC News,"Rupert Murdoch, 92, got engaged to his girlfriend, Elena Zhukova, a spokesman said on Thursday, which would mark his fifth trip down the aisle.
The wedding will be held in California, at Murdoch’s vineyard and estate, Moraga, a spokesman said.
The impending nuptials come just months after Murdoch stepped down as chairman of Fox and News Corp, ending a more than seven-decade career at the helm of a sprawling media empire.
The New York Times, which first reported the news, said Zhukova, who is from Moscow, is 67. She is a retired molecular biologist whom Murdoch began dating in the summer, it added.
They met through Murdoch’s third wife, Wendi Deng, according to a report in the Daily Mail.
Murdoch’s most recent marriage to actress and model Jerry Hall ended in divorce in 2022 after six years. Hall previously was a longtime partner of Rolling Stones singer Mick Jagger.
The media mogul was briefly engaged last year to former San Francisco police chaplain Ann Lesley Smith, though the pair called off the engagement weeks later. Vanity Fair reported the breakup, citing one source who said Murdoch had grown uncomfortable with Smith’s outspoken evangelical views.
Moraga, where Murdoch is due to get married, is the same place where Murdoch and Walt Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger first discussed Disney’s acquisition of 21st Century Fox, a $71 billion deal that closed in 2019.

2024-03-12T15:44:53.795Z,44-foot sperm whale dies after rare beaching along Florida’s Gulf Coast,NBC News,"VENICE, Fla. — In a rare occurrence along Florida’s Gulf Coast, a large sperm whale that drew national attention after beaching itself on a sandbar died Monday, state wildlife officials said.
The whale was measured at about 44 feet long, roughly the size of a large school bus. It weighs as much as 70,000 pounds, officials said.
Police and wildlife officials began trying Sunday morning to free the male whale just off the beach in Venice, Florida. By that evening, the whale was suffering from labored breathing and died around 3 a.m. Monday, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.
“Today, biologists will collect samples to attempt to determine cause of illness and death and to better understand sperm whale health, and life history,” the FWC said in a statement.
The process was expected to take weeks.
Although there are an estimated 1,100 sperm whales in the Gulf of Mexico, they are typically found in deep waters and rarely venture close to shore. Only a few such strandings occur each year in the southeast U.S., according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
Laura Engleby, chief of the marine mammal branch for NOAA’s southeast region, said at a news conference the last sperm whale beaching along the Gulf happened in 2008.
“We don’t typically see them. This is a rare event,” Engleby said, adding that the whale appeared “very thin” and was most likely very ill. Sample testing will determine the cause of death.
“Sometimes we won’t know for months the results of those,” she said. “Sometimes it’s obvious right away.”
Sperm whales are listed as an endangered species in the U.S.
Eventually, the whale’s carcass is likely to be either towed out to sea, taken to a landfill or buried, officials said. It was initially estimated by police to be 70 feet long before it was determined to be shorter in length.
Venice is about 75 miles south of Tampa.

2024-03-12T22:04:23.300Z,Former Jaguars employee who stole $22M from team gets over 6 years in prison,NBC News,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. — A former Jacksonville Jaguars financial manager who pled guilty to stealing more than $22 million from the NFL franchise through its virtual credit card program was sentenced to 78 months in federal prison Tuesday.
Judge Henry Lee Adams Jr. sentenced Amit Patel, 31, in U.S. District Court in Jacksonville. Patel, wearing a charcoal suit and a burgundy tie, showed no emotion inside the packed courthouse as the punishment was handed down.
Prosecutors said Patel has returned $1.89 million, leaving his restitution tab at $21,132,454.40 — a figure the judge acknowledged he will never be able to pay back following a felony conviction. Patel pled guilty in December to one count of wire fraud and one count of making an illegal monetary transaction.
The judge sentenced Patel to 78 months on each count, to run concurrently. It was the lowest number under sentencing guidelines. He also got three years of supervised release.
Patel’s lawyer argued for a lighter sentence Tuesday, asking for no more than 60 months. Prosecutors countered and detailed how Patel used “insider information” to go unnoticed for 40 months (between 2019 and 2023) while making hundreds of fraudulent transactions.
“If he can steal $22 million and get probation, he’s going to do it again,” assistant U.S. attorney Michael J. Coolican argued. “He’s a smart guy and will find a way. ... If it’s reported on SportsCenter tonight you can steal $22 million and get a low-ball sentence, a slap on the wrist, you better watch out.”
Patel had roughly two dozen friends and family members in the courthouse. Four of them spoke on his behalf: his older brother, an uncle, a former high school teacher and his girlfriend.
Patel wiped away tears as his brother detailed his younger sibling’s alcohol abuse and gambling addiction, as his uncle told the court what a prison sentence would do to Patel’s widowed mother, as his former teacher called him a model student and as his girlfriend talked about standing by him through weekly alcohol and gambling addiction meetings and having to take a job as an Uber driver.
Patel closed the hearing and said he started gambled 14 years ago.
“I stand before you embarrassed, ashamed and disappointed for my actions,” he said. “It began small and then snowballed so big that my only thought was to gamble my way out of it. In the end, I always thought that big win was right around the corner and would fix all my problems.”
Patel said he is nearing one year of sobriety.
“Part of my recovery process is making amends,” Patel said. “However, that seems impossible given how many people I’ve let down.”
Megha Parekh, the Jaguars’ chief legal officer, read a victim-impact statement to the court.
“Speaking on behalf of the Jaguars, do know that we want to move on and forgive, not just Amit, but ourselves for trusting him only to watch him shame us, individually and collectively,” Parekh said. “We are proud of our employees for how they weathered through the mess he made. But make no mistake, Amit broke our hearts.”
Patel’s lawyers said he gambled away “approximately 99%” of the misappropriated money and said his gambling losses totaled $32 million.
Patel gambled on prominent websites at the Jaguars’ facility, which triggered an NFL investigation. The NFL met with Patel in February and then turned the case over to the FBI. The Jaguars subsequently suspended and eventually fired Patel, who began working for the team in 2018.
Patel oversaw the company’s monthly financial statements and department budgets and served as the club’s administrator of its virtual credit card program, which allowed authorized employees to “request VCC’s for business-related purchases or expenses.”
Patel used his control to make fraudulent transactions, according to the court filing. He duplicated and inflated transactions for items such as catering, airfare and hotel charges and filed fake transactions that seemed legitimate.
The Jaguars insist Patel was a rogue employee who took advantage of a lack of oversight after a co-worker with similar authority was moved to another department. No one else in the finance department has been fired, and the Jags have since instituted more checks and balances to prevent something similar from happening again.
Patel went to great lengths to hide his actions, even paying off some of the credit card debt from his personal account. He used the money to buy two vehicles, a condominium in nearby Ponte Vedra Beach, a designer watch and cryptocurrency, according to court documents.
He spent more than $278,000 on hotels, rental properties and travel. He spent more than $200,000 on golf memorabilia, including $47,113.92 to purchase a putter used by Tiger Woods during the 1996 U.S. Amateur. He spent more than $77,000 at the Ponte Vedra Beach Inn & Club. He spent $140,412.97 on eBay and $69,025.26 with Ticketmaster.
He also used $275,000 of the stolen funds to hire his attorney, according to court documents.

2024-03-13T21:25:56.733Z,Wildflower watchers have reason to believe a 'superbloom' is waiting to erupt in Southern California,NBC News,"ANZA-BORREGO DESERT STATE PARK, Calif. — For most of the year, the hills around Southern California are characteristically brown. Los Angeles’s Mediterranean-type climate survives on an average of less than 15 inches of rain a year, and in areas that are classified as desert, it’s even less.
But near-record winter rainfall has turned those often-brown slopes into seas of undulating green — and in places, a sleeping beauty is slowly awakening.
While a wildflower “superbloom” is hard to predict, experts say a heavy seed load in previous years, combined with the rainfall, could soon make for a must-see kaleidoscope of color in the weeks ahead.
In places like the Anza-Borrego Desert State Park in San Diego County, the bloom is already underway — though it’s too soon to define it as “super.”
Technically, a superbloom is a relatively rare event in which an inordinately high number of dormant wildflower seeds bloom at once. But don’t try telling visitors to the park that what’s already happening is anything less than magical.
“Never in my life would have thought there would be this many flowers in the desert,” said Chandini Sharma, who clutched her iPhone while FaceTiming a friend in India. “She was like, ‘Is this a flower show?’ And I was like, ‘No, no, no, this is a desert. This is a bonafide desert.’”
Vibrant hues of purple, yellow and orange sparkle across the desert floor, with the desert lily, primrose, phacelia and wooly sunflower already putting on a show.
Sharma flew from Oklahoma to see the spring bloom at Anza-Borrego after hearing about it just last week.
“It’s not a superbloom, but it’s pretty darn good for me. I’m happy with this,” she said. “When I got in there, the first thing I said was, ‘If I die and go to heaven, I’ll be OK right now.’ It was literally that kind of a moment.”
Anza-Borrego is one of several landmark sites known for potentially spectacular wildflower blooms. In previous years the excitement has pushed so many visitors to places like Walker Canyon that officials in Lake Elsinore, California, closed roads and pushed visitors to use shuttle buses, while also contending with reports of trampled flowers as shutterbugs sought the most Instagram-worthy shots.
While the crowds have frustrated some, the folks at the Theodore Payne Foundation see an opportunity — teaching Southern Californians and visitors about the amazing ecology of a region close to home. The foundation is a nonprofit organization dedicated to the education, preservation and use of California native wildflowers and plants.
Now in its 41st year, the foundation’s ""Wild Flower Hotline"" is a bit of old-world charm that delivers very up-to-date lessons on what is blooming and where. And while it does highlight the better-known sites like Anza-Borrego and the Carrizo Plain National Monument when they are in bloom, it also showcases trails just minutes from downtown Los Angeles when the time is right.
“What trails have the best blooms, what roads can you pull over and see wildflowers on the side, what flowers are blooming,” the foundation's executive director, Evan Meyer, said. “It’s sort of like an easy way to get out and connect with nature.”
The hotline — which for the first time is also available in a weekly podcast — is voiced by actor Joe Spano, best known for NBC's “Hill Street Blues,” the movie “Apollo 13” and the CBS drama “NCIS.”
Spano fell into the project years ago given his own love for nature and the Southern California landscape.
“We could plant them and we do plant them in our gardens,” Spano said of wildflowers, “but what’s really magic about them is the fact that you go out and find them. There’s no downside to beautiful flowers coming out of the ground.”
The hotline launched Friday and will run for 12 weeks, or about the time spring turns to summer and the wildflowers say goodbye until next year. And while photos on social media may give it a run for its money, Meyer hopes the nostalgia provides a different inspiration.
“It gets you out of that social media bubble and gets you into nature,” he said.

2024-03-13T20:29:26.947Z,"Boeing whistleblower’s case could go on posthumously, attorney says",NBC News,"A whistleblower and former Boeing inspector who died from an apparent suicide just months before his yearslong case was coming to a head could have his matter heard posthumously, a legal expert said.
John Barnett, 62, of Louisiana, was found dead Saturday in the parking lot of a Charleston, South Carolina, Holiday Inn “from what appears to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound,” a county coroner said.
Barnett was in town to give deposition testimony in his federal legal action against Boeing, with his case, which dates back to 2017, set to finally come before an administrative law judge this summer, according to his legal team.
Barnett's death should not end the claim, as his estate could be substituted in as the complainant, Washington, D.C., whistleblower attorney Stephen Kohn said.
“He won’t be able to get reinstatement, but the estate should be able to get compensatory damages for the stress that he suffered and back retirement,” Kohn said.
For years, Barnett had alleged that Boeing retaliated against him for exposing potential safety issues with the 787 Dreamliner.
Under federal whistleblower protections, air industry employees like Barnett who believe they’ve been targeted for making concerns known are required to press their case through an administrative law process known as AIR21.
Boeing has denied it retaliated against Barnett, but it failed in 2022 to get the plaintiff’s case tossed.
Barnett had alleged he was the victim of a “hostile work environment and constructive discharge,” according to a May 31, 2022, ruling against the company by an administrative law judge.
Employers allegedly targeted Barnett with “downgraded performance reviews” and “removal from investigations, denial of transfers, harassment/denigration” that all might have amounted to a “constructive discharge,” the ruling said.
In the whistleblower community, the AIR21 process has well-known advantages and disadvantages, compared to a state or federal civil lawsuit, according to the attorney.
On one hand, administrative law judges are well versed in whistleblower law. On the other, there’s a logjam of cases that keep potential victims waiting for years.
“Delays, lack of resources, you could be out of work and out of a job for years,” Kohn said. “It’s very hard to get lawyers. How can you afford a lawyer when the case goes on and on?”
Barnett’s death stunned his attorneys, who believed their client was eager to finally present this case.
“He was in very good spirits and really looking forward to putting this phase of his life behind him and moving on,” attorneys Brian Knowles and Robert Turkewitz said in a joint statement on Tuesday. “We didn’t see any indication he would take his own life. No one can believe it.”
Knowles and Turkewitz said their client’s yearslong push showed how much he believed in the case.
“John was a brave, honest man of the highest integrity. He cared dearly about his family, his friends, the Boeing company, his Boeing co-workers, and the pilots and people who flew on Boeing aircraft,” the attorneys said. “We have rarely met someone with a more sincere and forthright character.”
They urged local police to keep investigating despite the coroner’s initial ruling.
“We are all devastated,” the legal team said. “We need more information about what happened to John. The Charleston police need to investigate this fully and accurately and tell the public what they find out. No detail can be left unturned.”
Boeing officials said they were “saddened by Mr. Barnett’s passing,” but declined to answer additional questions about him or the case.

2024-03-13T14:15:31.868Z,Arkansas stops offering 'X' as an alternative to male and female on state IDs,NBC News,"LITTLE ROCK, Ark. — Arkansas will no longer allow residents to use “X” instead of male or female on state-issued driver’s licenses or identification cards, officials announced under new rules Tuesday that will also make it more difficult for transgender people to change the sex listed on their licenses and IDs.
The changes announced by the Department of Finance and Administration reverse a practice that’s been in place since 2010, and removes the “X” option that had been used by nonbinary and intersex residents. The agency has asked a legislative panel to approve an emergency rule spelling out the new process.
Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who last year signed an executive order banning gender-neutral terms from state documents, called the move “common sense.”
“As long as I’m governor, Arkansas state government will not endorse nonsense,” Sanders said in a news release.
The move is latest among Republican states to legally define sex as binary, which critics say is essentially erasing transgender and nonbinary people’s existences and creating uncertainty for intersex people — those born with physical traits that don’t fit typical definitions of male or female.
“This proposed policy seeks to erase the existence of non-binary and intersex Arkansans by denying them identity documents that reflect their true selves, forcing them into categories that do not represent their identities,” the American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas said in a statement.
At least 22 states and the District of Columbia allow “X” as an option on licenses and IDs. All previously issued Arkansas licenses and IDs with the “X” designation will remain valid through their existing expiration dates, the department said. Arkansas has more than 2.6 million active driver’s licenses, and 342 of them have the “X” designation. The state has about 503,000 IDs, and 174 with the “X” designation.The changes would also make it more difficult for transgender people to change the sex listed on their licenses and IDs by requiring an amended birth certificate be submitted. Currently, a court order is required to change the sex listed on a birth certificate in the state.
Under the new rules, the sex listed on an Arkansas driver’s license or ID must match a person’s birth certificate, passport or Homeland Security document. Passports allow “X ”as an option alongside male and female. If a person’s passport lists “X” as their gender marker, the applicant must choose male or female, Finance and Administration spokesman Scott Hardin said.
DFA Secretary Jim Hudson said in a statement that the previous practice wasn’t supported by state law and hadn’t gone through the public comment process and legislative review required by law.
The policy comes after Arkansas has enacted several measures in recent years targeting the rights of transgender people, including a ban on gender affirming care for minors that’s been struck down by a federal judge as unconstitutional. The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is scheduled to hear oral arguments next month in the state’s appeal of that decision.

2024-03-12T19:33:08.706Z,The enduring power of J.Lo: How Jennifer Lopez marks our lives then … and now,NBC News,"Jennifer Lopez knows how to grab our attention.
Her latest project, an album and accompanying musical film titled “This is Me… Now,"" has been both praised and criticized, with many in between trying to understand what Lopez’s latest artistic endeavor even means.
Yet the myriad reactions dissecting the project all point to one key fact. Like it or not, we're talking about J.Lo.
“She’s an anomaly,” culture critic Jack Rico told NBC News. ""Today, I don’t think it’s possible to fully comprehend and grasp how special Jennifer Lopez is. ... She should be a case study, the same way we have college classes for Bad Bunny or Taylor Swift.”
In a way, the Lopez enigma is at the center of her enduring power as someone who marked a generation of millennials — especially  Latino millennials like me.
Lopez has “cracked all of the walls and barriers” society placed on her and more broadly places on Latinos, on women and on people over 50, Rico said. “She’s a defiance.”
People my age don’t remember a time when Lopez wasn’t a big deal — setting trends with her music and dance moves, her acting performances and her fashion choices.
Lopez has worked consistently through the years — she has starred in over 35 movies, released nine studio albums, produced and appeared in countless TV shows, published a memoir, completed a residency in Las Vegas and a world tour.
She also became a fashion icon following her red carpet appearance in 2000 wearing a show-stopping green Versace dress that inspired the creation of Google images.
And those not familiar with her trajectory probably know of Lopez from her highly publicized string of romances and marriages.
So what has she done lately? She spent $20 million of her own money in a multimedia project that leans into her love life, her way.
In “This Is Me... Now,” Lopez takes her sometimes questionable and even eye-rolling relationships and shines on them a spotlight few artists at her level would dare to do, focusing mainly on her rekindled romance with now-husband actor Ben Affleck. The result? She got our attention — and got a lot of critics and fans talking about it.
Lopez has said her latest project is her ""most honest"" one yet, though fans and detractors say she held back on the subject of relationships and her tumultuous path to self-love.
The album sounds like a musical time capsule encompassing her 25-year music career and her lifelong search for her voice and artistic identity.
The film is not quite conceptual nor completely abstract, but something in between, mixing lighthearted and introspective moments to take us on her journey to ... yes, love.
In my view, what “This Is Me... Now” does effectively is showcase Lopez’s confidence as a triple-threat performer: singer, dancer and actor.
While her latest work reminded people like me of her unmatched talent, some say it was a missed opportunity for the 54-year-old to open up at a more personal level, distancing herself from her performer persona and showing off a more vulnerable, different side.
“The thing about Jennifer, and I think this is where a lot of the criticism is coming from, is that she has not been able to evolve,” Rico said. “You can’t get bigger than what she has done, and I think there’s a part of her that is like, ‘How do I top myself?’”
Yet the recent debate proves that Lopez remains relevant — and is still shifting and influencing American pop culture.
Because “This Is Me... Now” serves as a bookend to her 2002 studio album “This Is Me… Then” — inspired by Lopez’s first engagement to Affleck and eventual breakup — it’s making many of us revisit our own memories of growing up with Lopez.
I can't tell you exactly when I first heard Lopez’s 1999 debut single, “If You Had My Love.” I just know I've always known it. The song catapulted Lopez’s music career following her breakout performance as the slain “Queen of Tejano Music” Selena Quintanilla in the 1997 film “Selena,” which turned her into a Hollywood movie star and helped cement Selena's musical legacy to a younger generation like me.
Lopez then established herself as a mega pop star with iconic music videos and hits like “Let’s Get Loud” and “Waiting for Tonight"" from her debut album “On The 6.”
The first album I ever owned was the Backstreet Boys’ 1999 album “Millenium” — who didn't succumb to the boy band craze of the 1990s? But the one I cherished most was Lopez’s 2001 album “J.Lo.”
At 7, I used crayons to label my ""J.Lo"" album with my name in case I lost it while taking it everywhere in my portable CD player. I couldn't understand much of the lyrics because I only spoke Spanish, but I remember imitating Lopez while dancing to her pop tracks combined with Y2K era electronic sounds, R&B, hip-hop and Latin music influences.
The “J.Lo” album debuted at No. 1. That same week, Lopez starred in the romantic comedy “The Wedding Planner” — which topped the box office.
“When she has the No. 1 record, and the No. 1 movie at the exact same time for all general audiences, it’s nothing short of a miracle,” Rico said. In fact, the milestone made Lopez the first woman to simultaneously have a top film and album on opening week.
As a kid who loved performing and once aspired to be a dancer, seeing a fellow Puerto Rican succeed at this epic scale gave me confidence in my own identity from a very young age.
Lopez achieved superstar status alongside a few other artists of Hispanic descent who reached global success during the Latin music explosion of the late 1990s and early 2000s.
If there was a Mount Rushmore for the Latin explosion, the faces of Lopez, Ricky Martin, Marc Anthony and Shakira would be carved in it — and maybe Christina Aguilera, who is Ecuadorian American, and Enrique Iglesias, a Hispanic from Spain, if we had more space.
Growing up at this time, I thought it was always this way. But as an adult, I realized it was mostly a specific period in pop culture.
Decades later, Lopez and Shakira reignited this history during their record-breaking 2020 Super Bowl Halftime performance, featuring Bad Bunny and J Balvin, two big faces of the new Latin music boom dominated by reggaeton music.
""The Super Bowl was a very revealing Jennifer Lopez moment,"" Leila Cobo, Billboard’s chief content officer of Latin, told the Pop Pantheon podcast on August 2023. ""It showed why she still matters.”
Lopez, a U.S.-born Latina, is inherently bicultural. Her innate code-switching abilities has helped her become a naturally shapeshifting entertainer, a unique quality that's kept her in the pop culture zeitgeist for nearly three decades.
“She can be 40. She can be 50. She can be 85. And she still can pull that off,"" Cobo said. ""Not very many people can do that ... This is not simply someone who’s here for celebrity. I think she wants to transcend that.""
I no longer buy J.Lo CDs and mark them with a crayon. But listening to ""This Is Me... Now"" made me think about my own path to self-acceptance and yes, finding love along the way.
I still tease my mother for not taking me to Lopez’s 2001 concert in Puerto Rico, where I lived as a child, because I was too young. She promised she would take me the next time Lopez had a concert in my homeland, but that was the only show Lopez ever did there. For years, my consolation prize was endlessly rewatching the DVD version of the 2001 concert I got as a Three Kings Day gift.
But I got a second chance.
I was recently listening to the new album, where songs like “Can’t Get Enough” let me bask in the joy of being a newlywed, and where “Rebound” and “Broken Like Me” make me reflect on how far I’ve come, and I told my husband about how I still dreamed of seeing Lopez in concert.
He then surprised me with tickets to one of Lopez's shows in New York City, where I now live, to celebrate my 30th birthday this summer.
You could say the full-circle moment shows how Lopez marked my life then … and now.
That's a pretty remarkable journey for Jenny from the Block.

2024-03-12T12:24:11.881Z,FAA audit of Boeing's 737 Max production reportedly found 'dozens of issues',NBC News,"U.S. air safety regulators found “dozens of problems” at facilities owned by Boeing and one of its key suppliers after a six-week audit of the production of the 737 Max jet, according to The New York Times.
The Federal Aviation Administration started the probe after a door panel blew off a 737 Max 9 flight on Alaska Airlines in early January, an incident that has attracted intense scrutiny of Boeing’s quality-control practices.
The NYT report, published Tuesday, was based on a review of an internal FAA slide presentation and offered a glimpse into the numerous issues found by auditors. Many of the problems fell under the category of failure to follow “approved manufacturing processes” and failure to keep proper quality control documentation, according to the Times.
FAA auditors found that out of 89 product audits that were conducted, Boeing passed 56 tests and failed 33 of them, according to the report.
During the six-week audit, the FAA also conducted 13 product audits that focused on Spirit AeroSystems, which makes fuselages for the Boeing 737 Max — of those, only six audits resulting in passing grades, and seven failed, the NYT said.
A document reviewed by the Times found that a mechanic at Spirit used a hotel key card to check a door seal. In another instance, the FAA reportedly saw Spirit mechanics apply liquid Dawn soap to a door seal to use as a lubricant in the “fit-up process.”
A spokesman for Spirit reportedly said the company was “reviewing all identified nonconformities for corrective action.”
In late February, the FAA gave Boeing 90 days to develop a plan for quality-control improvements. Around the same time, an expert panel’s report on Boeing found a “disconnect” between its senior management and employees regarding safety culture.
The panel report had been required by the U.S. Congress after two crashes in 2018 and 2019 involving Boeing 737 Max planes killed all the passengers and crew aboard — a total of 346 people.
In response to the NYT report and recent expert panel report, Boeing said it continues “to implement immediate changes and develop a comprehensive action plan to strengthen safety and quality.”
“We are squarely focused on taking significant, demonstrated action with transparency at every turn,” Boeing said in a statement to CNBC.
In addition to the FAA, the National Transportation Safety Board is looking into what caused the 737 Max jet door panel to blow off during the Alaska Airlines incident, and the Justice Department has reportedly begun a criminal investigation into the company.

2024-03-11T23:05:09.830Z,Latino evangelical support for Christian nationalism rises as Trump courts religious vote,NBC News,"MIAMI — During a Sunday sermon in mid-February, Pastor Dionny Báez shared an omen with his congregation.
“I believe that God is going to do something very great with the Latino people in the United States,” he said.
The congregation responded with applause and remained attentive to the rest of the morning evangelical service held weekly in an old nightclub.
The message evangelical leaders give churchgoers during a  presidential campaign is a valuable key to understanding where the evangelical voting bloc is headed.
“We are heads of communities, right? There are literally thousands of people who are influenced by our word,” said Báez, founder of the H20 Church, in an interview with Noticias Telemundo.
Baez said his priority when supporting a candidate is that they're aligned with his values. He advised others to do the same when they ask him for guidance on the November contest.
Evangelicals are a conservative bloc of the Hispanic electorate that is “more involved than ever” in the elections, said evangelical Pastor Samuel Rodríguez, president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference (NHCLC), which touts itself as the largest Hispanic Christian organization worldwide with over 40,000 churches in the United States alone.
“Evangelical Latinos this year are going to vote like no other year,"" Rodríguez said. The security of the country and the economy, parental rights, the free expression of religion and the rights of Christians are the issues that are mobilizing them the most in this election cycle.
In the U.S., around 10 million Hispanics identify as evangelical or Protestant and “approximately three in ten Hispanic Republicans (28%) consider themselves evangelical Protestants,” according to the most recent figures from the Pew Research Center.
For decades, U.S. evangelicals have solidly been part of the electoral base of the Republican Party, which defends their conservative positions on abortion and other matters. As conservative Republicans continue to court these voters, their vow to align their political agenda with Christian values ​​has become more frequent and explicit.
During the National Convention of Religious Broadcasters held at the end of February in Nashville, Tennessee, the packed auditorium burst into applause when former President Donald Trump said, “We have to get our religion back, we have to get Christianity back in this country.”
“No one will touch the cross of Christ under the Trump administration, I swear,” Trump said, after falsely claiming that there’s religious persecution against Christianity in the U.S.
Trump’s rhetoric is linked to the ideology of Christian nationalism, which calls for America to be an unequivocal Christian nation in its laws and customs, and whose adherents don't believe in a separation of church and state.
This system of religious and identity beliefs has permeated among Hispanics who belong to evangelical and Protestant churches.
Though the majority of Americans (67%), reject or are skeptical of Christian nationalism, it resonates strongly with two religious groups: 66% of white evangelicals and 55% of Hispanic Protestants,  who say they support or sympathize with this movement, according to a 2023 American Values ​​Atlas survey conducted nationwide by the nonpartisan Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI).
The survey interviewed over 22,000 adults in 50 states, measuring respondents’ affinity for the following statements: the U.S. government should declare America a Christian nation; U.S. laws should be based on Christian values; if the U.S. moves away from our Christian foundations, we will not have a country anymore; being Christian is an important part of being truly American; and God has called Christians to exercise dominion over all areas of American society.
Hispanic Protestants were the only religious group that saw an increase in support for Christian nationalism, growing by 12% between the first survey in 2022 and 2023.
By contrast, levels of acceptance for Christian nationalism were significantly lower among other religious groups: 75% of Hispanic Catholics and 92% of American Jews don't identify with these ideas.
The survey found that among whites and Hispanics, but not among Black Americans, ""holding Christian nationalist beliefs is strongly correlated with Republican Party identity and support for Trump.""
Religious leaders as well as Christian nationalism scholars warn that Christian nationalists seek to exert their beliefs on all aspects of government and society, believing such is the will of God.
A few weeks before the PRRI report was published, Noticias Telemundo attended an evangelical service in Miami led by Báez to report on the Latino evangelical vote.
Though Baez and members of the congregation were not asked specifically about the term Christian nationalism, they were asked about their concerns and priorities ahead of the November election and the role of religion played in their political stance.
When Baez was asked whether the laws of this country should be based on Christian values, he said, “That would be an ideal world, an ideal world because they are my values, it is my way of thinking, it would be beautiful because I believe that the integral Christian foundation helps the development of the human being.” But Baez added that it’s important to respect others’ way of thinking as well as their values.
For Osmani Martínez, a Cuban Christian who plans to vote for Trump, “it would be very good if the state and the church became one,” he said.
Elizabeth Rodríguez, who is Puerto Rican, has worked for many years with the Democratic Party. In addition to her Christian faith, who she chooses on the ballot, she said, will also be influenced by what candidates propose a plan for the “well-being of my community, for the well-being of the family.”
She advocates freedom and democracy, but said there should be a system where God is included.
Félix Córdova, who is Mexican, has been attending the H20 church where he feels “the presence of God.” He hopes to be able to participate in the November election after passing his citizenship exam. If he votes, he said, it will be for Trump “because he has made a difference, he continues to make it, he is a man who bends the knee and asks the Father for direction.”
Córdova considers himself spiritual, is not in favor of abortion and believes that the Republican Party maintains Christian values ​​in a world that, he said, is out of control. For him, spiritual education should be the source of support for American laws.
Carlos Malavé, president of the Latino Christian National Network, believes a lack of education about Christian nationalism and its political connotations has allowed many Hispanics to be indoctrinated with these ideas. He believes Latinos embrace this rhetoric without realizing that it attacks their community.
""When you generally ask the public, in churches, what Christian nationalism is, people cannot give an answer,” he said. Malavé belongs to Christians Against Christian Nationalism, a group of religious leaders that denounce this ideology as a threat to American democracy and a distortion of the Christian faith.
The Protestant reverend, who was born in Puerto Rico, said that the ideology’s undercurrent of racism and patriarchy can facilitate a marginalization of vulnerable groups or minorities, including immigrants. “A magnificent job has been done by groups that are extremists to convince even the immigrants themselves that the new immigrants are a threat,” Malavé said.
Malavé said Christian nationalism, which erases the separation of church and state, is based on the supremacy of white culture and the supremacy of Christianity over other religions.
Christian nationalists proffer that the U.S. has been and always should be Christian, from the top to the people, according to the group Christians Against Christian Nationalism. In addition, it carries “assumptions about nativism, white supremacy, authoritarianism, patriarchy and militarism,” Malavé said.
In their book ""Taking Back America for God,"" which delves into how  this ideology is increasingly trying to win over conservative Latinos, Andrew Whitehead and Samuel L. Perry argue this is a line of thought that prevails among the followers of Trump.
""American Christian nationalism is a worldview based on the belief that the United States is superior to other countries and that that superiority was divinely established,” said Samuel Perry, associate professor at Baylor University, a private Christian academic institution in Texas, in an article on the specialized site ""The Conversation.""
“In their minds, only Christians are true Americans,” he notes.
According to Perry, although most Christian nationalists do not commit acts of violence, the ideology “suggests that unless Christians control the state, the state will suppress Christianity.”
“Most of this misinformation and lies that are being perpetuated come from radical Republican groups,” Malavé said.
Efforts to raise awareness in the Latino community about the implications of this rhetoric are underway, but face major challenges.
Báez says he initially admired Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis’ proposals, especially those aimed at restricting the discussion of gender identity and sexual orientation with younger children in public schools, but became disenchanted with the presidential hopeful when he displayed an anti-immigrant position.
Báez sees Christian Latinos at a crossroads when it comes to going to the polls, since the party that defends its religious principles — the Republican Party — also promotes the most anti-immigrant policies and rhetoric.
“What do I say to my congregation? I really tell our people that more than immigration reform or help for people who are entering illegally — we must focus on the values ​​that reflect who we are as a Christian community,"" he said.
In California, Pastor Samuel Rodríguez said that he's also concerned about the anti-immigrant positions of most conservative Republicans: “I don’t like it because sometimes the rhetoric is nativist and racist and I don’t deny it.”
However, he's convinced that without Christianity there is only anarchy, chaos and darkness. That is why he believes that many Christian Latinos no longer support the Democratic Party, particularly for defending abortion.
“Let them continue with that strategy to see if it works for them,” he said.
Rodríguez said that the U.S. was founded under a Judeo-Christian platform, but when asked whether it should legislate with those values ​​as a guide, he said, “We are not a theocracy.”
For some far-right politicians, such as Lauren Boebert, the Republican congresswoman from Colorado, the separation of state and church “is garbage.”
“The church is supposed to lead the government, not the government is supposed to lead the church,” she said in July 2022.
“We should be Christian nationalists,” said Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who insisted that Christian nationalism should not be feared because it could solve school shootings and “sexual immorality” in the country.
In early February, a convoy organized for a ""Take Our Border Back"" rally demonstrated at the southern Texas border, attracting Trump supporters and Christian nationalists who carried crosses and were baptized as they gathered to support hard-line border enforcement.

2024-03-14T12:26:33.585Z,Severe storms bring baseball-sized hail to the Midwest and heavy snow to the Rockies,NBC News,"Hail ranging in size from a quarter to a baseball hit parts of the Midwest and heavy snow fell in the Rockies overnight as parts of the United States experienced severe weather, including thunderstorms, heavy rain and at least one possible tornado.
Severe thunderstorm warnings were in place across parts of Illinois and Missouri until at least midday.
The National Weather Service in Kansas City, Missouri, warned residents to stay inside and stay away from windows because ""this storm has a history of producing softball-sized hail (3.5 inches).""
NBC affiliate KSHB of Kansas City reported that drivers were sheltering under a bridge on Interstate 70 to avoid baseball-sized hail, which has smashed windshields.
The weather service in Topeka, Kansas, said hail as big as a quarter and gusts up to 60 mph could last until Thursday morning. Video showed what appeared to be a huge tornado moving through northwest Kansas on Wednesday night.
The Storm Prediction Center said early Thursday that ""scattered severe thunderstorms capable of tornadoes [and] large to very large hail"" was possible from parts of the south-central states into the Midwest.
The area most likely to face the most severe conditions is a corridor from southeast Oklahoma into northern Arkansas and southern Missouri during Thursday afternoon and evening.
Almost 13,000 customers in Colorado were without power as of 5 a.m. ET, with CORE Electric Cooperative warning that ""significant"" snowfall could affect services through Friday.
So far, Aspen Springs has recorded 23 inches of snow; Pinecliffe, 18.5;  Jamestown, 14.3; Evergreen, 13.5; and Nederland, 12.1.
Snowfall is expected to continue Thursday, with rates of 2 to 3 inches an hour at times. It is not expected to let up until Friday morning.
The Colorado Department of Transportation urged drivers to stay home and keep off the roads as a storm was predicted to dump multiple feet of snow on the Denver metro region, up to 1 or 2 inches per hour, raising the risk of avalanches in mountain passes.
At least 23 inches of snow has fallen in Aspen Springs, the weather service in Boulder, Colorado, said on X.
""Even during periods when roads are warm and some snow melts, precipitation rates could be heavy during these periods, compromising visibility for drivers,"" the department said in a statement late Wednesday.
""With snow expected to fall at a fast rate, visibility is likely to be compromised even during periods when snow is melting quickly,"" Executive Director Shoshana Lew said.
Mike Cooperstein, the northern mountains regional manager for the Colorado Avalanche Information Center, said that he had ""high confidence"" the center's avalanche mitigation operations will be needed during and after the storm.
As many as 5 million people were under winter alerts early Thursday as heavy snow fell over parts of Colorado, northern Arizona, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming.
The extreme weather is expected to push southward from the eastern central Plains into Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas on Friday before reaching southeastern Texas early Saturday.
Meanwhile, the weather service said to expect ""an extended period of very warm and pleasant weather,"" with mid-Atlantic regions 20 to 25 degrees above seasonal averages, although a cold front from Canada could end this by Saturday.

2024-03-13T10:29:19.593Z,New team of Marines sent in to shore up security at the U.S. Embassy in Haiti,NBC News,"A new team of Marines has been sent to Haiti to help protect the American Embassy, the U.S. military said Wednesday, a day after the beleaguered Caribbean nation's prime minister announced his resignation following months of rising unrest and gang violence.
The U.S. Southern Command said in a statement that a fleet anti-terrorism security team, known as FAST, was deployed to the embassy in the nation's capital, Port-au-Prince, which has been at the center of the chaos and civil disorder.
The Marines are in the country to ""maintain strong security capabilities at the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince, Haiti and conduct relief in place for our current Marines, a common and routine practice worldwide,"" the statement said.
The statement added that the embassy remains open, although only limited operations continue, including ""supporting Haitian-led efforts to secure a peaceful transition of power.""
A spokesperson said that “U.S. Southern Command is prepared with a wide range of contingency plans to ensure the safety and security of U.S. Citizens in Haiti.”
The U.S. military initially flew in forces Sunday to airlift nonessential personnel out of the country, in a procedure that was described as standard practice.
Haitian Prime Minister Ariel Henry said Tuesday that he would stand down once a transitional government — agreed to at a meeting of Caribbean leaders and the U.S. on Monday — was appointed.
No time frame was given for the transition and Henry remains prime minister, although he is in Puerto Rico and unable to return to Haiti after armed gangs calling for his resignation took control of major airports.
The U.S. military statement said that the Defense Department has doubled its funding for a multinational security mission in Haiti and was working with Kenya and other partners to ""restore security in Haiti."" Additional support could include planning, information sharing, airlifts and medical support, it said.
While Henry's departure was a key demand of the armed gangs that now control large parts of the capital, it appears that their campaign may not stop there.
Speaking to the Reuters news agency Tuesday, gang leader Jimmy Cherizier — known as “Barbecue” — said he had a message for any hotel owners sheltering politicians: ""We are coming for you.""
""We won't lie to people, saying we have a peaceful revolution. We do not have a peaceful revolution. We are starting a bloody revolution in the country,"" he said.
Meanwhile, Americans continue to leave Haiti.
Journalist and author Mitch Albom, who founded the Have Faith Haiti nonprofit group, which works with children and orphans, said on Instagram on Tuesday night that he, his wife and eight volunteers were evacuated from the country, where they had been sheltering after a state of emergency was declared.
""My wife and I are safe tonight. Many Americans, Canadians, and others who are still stuck are not. The people of Haiti are not,"" he wrote.
""I hope that our attention can turn to them and how we can help restore peace and safety to a beautiful country and its people, including our kids, who deserve so much better,"" he added.

2024-03-13T16:43:07.520Z,Student pilot allegedly tries to storm Alaska Airlines cockpit multiple times midflight,NBC News,"A student pilot tried getting into the cockpit of a cross-country flight to Dulles, Va., telling crew members he was merely ""testing them"" with this dangerous stunt, authorities said.
Nathan Jones, 19, was aboard Alaska Airlines Flight 322 from San Diego to Dulles International Airport on March 3 when he ""made three separate attempts to go to the front of the plane and open the aircraft's cockpit door,"" according to an affidavit by Federal Air Marshal Thomas Pattinson.
Flight attendants ""requested the assistance of off-duty law enforcement officers, who restrained Jones in flex cuffs and sat on either side of him for the remainder of the flight,"" Pattinson added.
When flight attendants asked Jones what he was doing, the defendant allegedly said he ""was testing them,"" according to the affidavit.
Jones has been charged with alleged interference with a flight crew, which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years behind bars.
Jones had been living with his mother in Northern Virginia before this incident and defense lawyer Robert Jenkins wants his client psychologically evaluated before any kind of trial.
""We are very concerned about his mental health,"" Jenkins said in a statement to NBC News on Wednesday. ""I intend to request that the court evaluating him for competency to stand trial.""
The defense on Wednesday filed a letter from the jailers in Alexandria, Virginia, who said Jones is on suicide watch while displaying ""incoherent speech, disorganized behavior, mood lability and appears to be experiencing psychosis.""
Jones needs hospital-level ""care to stabilize his altered mental status that appears to be associated with psychiatric illness,"" according to Anne Zalewski, a licensed clinical social worker for the jail.
""Without proper treatment, Mr. Jones is likely to continue to decompensate and continue to be a harm to himself,"" Zalewski added.
After Flight 322 landed, Jones consented to have his belongings searched and investigators found ""multiple notebooks with writings describing how to operate an aircraft, including take-off, in-air and landing techniques,"" Pattinson wrote.
Jones' ""wallet contained a student pilot's license,"" the air marshal added.
For the rest of the trip, a beverage cart was placed at the cockpit door and one of flight attendant stood guard, officials said.
The FAA said in a statement on Wednesday that it's aware of the incident, which was described as a ""passenger disturbance."" That flight landed safely and the FAA is investigating, the agency added.
Alaska Airlines characterized the suspect as ""a passenger, who appeared confused, attempted to access the flight deck in a non-violent manner,"" the carrier said in a statement on Wednesday.
""The passenger was noncompliant, which prompted our flight crew to enlist off-duty law enforcement officers to help restrain him,"" Alaska Airlines added. ""The flight continued to IAD without incident. The passenger was arrested by local law enforcement and has been banned from traveling with us.""

The incident happened around 10:30 a.m. Saturday at the Fulton Street Station at Chambers Street, the New York City Police Department said.
Witnesses told officers that the woman and her boyfriend had been arguing before she was pushed, according to police.
The unidentified woman was taken to the hospital. Sources told NBC New York that she lost both of her feet.
No arrests had been made as of Saturday afternoon and the investigation remains ongoing.
Shortly after that incident, around 11:30 a.m. Saturday, an unidentified man was killed after he was struck by a subway at Seventh Avenue and West 53rd Street in midtown, police said.
Witnesses told officers that the man jumped onto the tracks, according to authorities.
Police said they do not believe the two incidents are connected.
Crime in the New York City subway system has been an ongoing issue. To combat it, Gov. Kathy Hochul said Wednesday she was ordering a force of nearly 1,000 people, including 750 National Guard members, state police and transit officers, to conduct bag checks at some of the busiest stations in an effort to rid the subways “of people who commit crimes” and to protect New Yorkers.

2024-03-11T16:43:23.580Z,U.S. ‘prepper’ culture diversifies amid fear of disaster and political unrest,NBC News,"LONGMONT, Colo. — Brook Morgan surveyed booths at the “Survival & Prepper Show” in Colorado that were stocked with boxes of ammunition, mounds of trauma medical kits, and every type of knife imaginable.
A self-described “30-year-old lesbian from Indiana,” Morgan is one of a new breed of Americans getting ready to survive political upheaval and natural catastrophes, a pursuit that until recently was largely associated with far-right movements such as white nationalists since the 1980s.
Researchers say the number of preppers has doubled in size to about 20 million since 2017. Much of that growth is from minorities and people considered left-of-center politically, whose sense of insecurity was heightened by Donald Trump’s 2016 election, the  pandemic, more frequent extreme weather and the 2020 racial justice protests following the murder of George Floyd.
“I’m really surprised by the number of people of color here,” Morgan said. “I always went to these shows with my family in Indiana and it was just white people who were my parents’ age. There are a lot of younger people here, too. It’s a real change.”
Morgan grew up in a prepper family and still considers herself self-reliant and ready to handle a disaster but she left the prepper world of her youth behind in part to escape the conservatism associated with the movement.
The diversification of prepping was clear last weekend at the Survival & Prepper show at the fairgrounds in Boulder County, a liberal district which President Joe Biden won in 2020 by nearly 57 percentage points over Trump. Over 2,700 people paid $10 each to attend the show, organizers said, and attendees were varied.
Bearded white men with closely cropped hair and heavily tattooed arms were there. But so were hippy moms carrying babies in rainbow colored slings and chatting about canning methods, Latino families looking over greenhouses and water filtration systems, and members of the local Mountain View Fire Rescue team, who in 2021 battled a devastating fire in the region, giving CPR demonstrations and encouraging citizens to be more prepared for extreme events.
Attendees and those running the booths said the show reflected the concerns of millions of Americans who no longer feel that they can always count on the government or private industry to provide the basics, like electricity, water and food.
They cited the pandemic disruption of supply chains, the 2021 power grid crisis in Texas that left millions without power, and the recent outages for thousands of AT&T mobile users.
Chris Ellis is a colonel in the U.S. Army who works on disaster preparedness and recovery and is a leading researcher into the prepper movement who has tracked its growth to 20 million people based on household resiliency data from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
He said that what shapes individual preppers — which he defines as someone who can live for a month with no outside support — is how they react to a single question: “Do I feel safe?”
“People want to regain their agency, their sense of control, and do something to match their fears to their actions,” said Ellis, who underscored that he did not speak on behalf of the Department of Defense.
People motivated by climate change, Ellis said, tend to be homesteaders who grow their own food and move to more “climate proof” locations, such as the mild summer haven of Duluth, Minnesota.
Others whose main fear is lawlessness are frequently the gun enthusiasts stereotypically associated with the prepper movement. The super rich often respond to their fears by spending millions to build bunkers in remote spots.
For John Ramey, a former innovation adviser to the Obama administration and creator of the prepper website The Prepared, the community has grown to reflect American society at large in terms of political beliefs and demographic categories.
“The only real unifying denominator among preppers these days is people who are smart enough to be aware of what the world is like … and they have the gumption to do something about it,” Ramey said.
Back at the prepper show at the Boulder County fairgrounds, Jennifer Council strummed her thumb against the edge of an ax, balanced it in her hand and said it was perfect for both cutting down small trees and doing the delicate shaving work needed to create tinder.
Council, a 50-year-old mom of three adult children and self-described Black urban farmer, lives in a suburban home northwest of Denver.
“Preppers used to be seen as extreme weirdos,” Council said. “Then the pandemic happened and grocery stores were short on food. Then you had the unrest of protests around the police killings of young Black men. Then you had the storming of the Capitol in Washington.”
“People are realizing that it’s important to be able to depend on what you can do for yourself.”

2024-03-12T20:32:26.933Z,Man finds out migraines caused by brain tapeworms; undercooked bacon may be culprit,NBC News,"A man was hospitalized with worsening migraines only to find out they were caused by parasitic tapeworm larvae in his brain — and researchers believe he was infected by eating undercooked bacon.
The unidentified 52-year-old American man consulted doctors about changes in his usual migraines over four months, according to a study in the American Journal of Case Reports published Thursday.  The migraines became more frequent, severe and unresponsive to medication.
The patient was admitted to the hospital for testing. CT scans revealed numerous cystic foci, which are fluid-filled sacs in the brain. Cysticercosis cyst antibody tests returned positive, and the man was diagnosed with neurocysticercosis, the study said.
Neurocysticercosis is a form of the parasitic tissue infection caused by larval cysts of the pork tapeworm found in the brain, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says.
A person contracts cysticercosis by ingesting larval cysts from infected feces, which typically occurs from a lack of handwashing, according to the CDC. The disease is endemic in the developing world because of poor sanitation.
The patient did not recently travel to high-risk areas, and his ""habit of eating lightly cooked, non-crispy bacon most of his life"" was the only connection to the neurocysticercosis diagnosis.
""It can only be speculated, but given our patient's predilection for undercooked pork and benign exposure history, we favor that his cysticercosis was transmitted via autoinfection after improper handwashing after he had contracted taeniasis himself from his eating habits,"" the report concluded.
The patient was successfully treated with anti-parasitic and anti-inflammatory medications. His brain lesions regressed, and his headaches improved.
It is ""very rare"" for patients to contract neurocysticercosis in the U.S., but the findings of the study may change that notion.
""It is historically very unusual to encounter infected pork in the United States, and our case may have public health implications,"" the report stated.
Symptoms of neurocysticercosis range from headaches to seizures, depending on what structures and tissues have been infected. The disease can be fatal, according to the CDC.

2024-03-13T13:43:26.665Z,"Utah prison discriminated against transgender woman, Department of Justice finds",NBC News,"SALT LAKE CITY — The Utah Department of Corrections came under fire Tuesday for discriminating against a transgender inmate who the U.S. Department of Justice said was driven to harm herself after she was repeatedly denied hormone therapy in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act.
A federal investigation found that the state corrections department imposed “unnecessary barriers” to block the incarcerated trans woman from receiving treatment for intense gender dysphoria. The woman’s psychological distress, which doctors attributed to a mismatch between her birth sex and her gender identity, worsened significantly while she was incarcerated in a men’s prison, according to the Justice Department report.
After nearly two years of fighting for access to hormones and other gender-affirming accommodations, she performed a dangerous self-surgery to cut off her own testicles.
Now, the DOJ is demanding immediate policy changes and anti-discrimination training for all Utah correctional officers to protect other inmates from future harm. The state agency also will be required to pay damages to the trans inmate, who was not identified in the report. The dollar amount had not been set as of Tuesday.
Brian Redd, executive director of the Utah Department of Corrections, pushed back against the discrimination allegations and said he was disappointed by the investigators’ approach. He did not indicate whether the agency would comply with the DOJ’s demands.
“We have been working to address this complex issue and were blindsided by today’s public announcement from the Department of Justice,” Redd said in a statement. “We have also taken steps on our own and as a state to address the needs of inmates while maintaining the highest safety standards.”
Gender dysphoria falls within the ADA’s definition of disability, meaning correctional facilities cannot deny medically appropriate care for people with the condition, according to a 2022 federal court ruling.
“All people with disabilities including those who are incarcerated are protected by the ADA and are entitled to reasonable modifications and equal access to medical care, and that basic right extends to those with gender dysphoria,” said Kristen Clarke, assistant attorney general of the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division.
The department’s investigation revealed that Utah corrections officers had unnecessarily delayed the woman’s hormone treatment even as her mental health worsened. She was made to jump through procedural hoops not required for other medical conditions and had to gain approval from a committee that DOJ Disability Rights Chief Rebecca Bond said included some members with a clear bias against transgender people.
Bond described the committee as the “gatekeeper” of care and criticized the state corrections department in a letter Tuesday for involving both medical and non-medical staff, even though the committee’s only role is to handle requests for medical care.
When they finally approved the inmate for hormone therapy more than 15 months after her initial request, federal investigators found that they failed to take basic steps to ensure it was administered safely.
Although taking estrogen can help trans women develop some desired physical features, such as breasts, it also increases their risk of developing a potentially life-threatening blood clot in the legs or lungs. Experts at the Endocrine Society, which represents specialists who treat hormone conditions, say such treatments require close medical supervision.
Utah prisons assign incarcerated people to either male or female housing based solely on their sex at commitment, which the DOJ found is determined by a visual search of the inmate’s genitals. The woman made repeated requests to be housed individually or with other women, but all those requests had been denied, according to the investigation.
Federal investigators say the prison did not make reasonable accommodations to assure her safety while surrounded by male inmates and staff. The state agency also prevented her from buying bras, makeup and women’s underwear at the commissary and required pat searches by male corrections officers, even as she began to develop breasts.
“By not allowing me this opportunity to live my life as a woman, who I believe I am and have lived life for many years,” she wrote in her ADA complaint, “the prison is causing me such mental stress.”

Emanuel Isac Celedon pleaded guilty in two federal cases Monday — one dealing with smuggling people into the U.S. and a second that involved taking a bribe for what he believed was a shipment of cocaine, prosecutors said.
Celedon, 36, worked at the Juarez-Lincoln Port of Entry in Laredo on the U.S.-Mexico border.
He let people through the lane he controlled without inspection at least nine times from September to November and told smugglers in advance what his lane assignment was, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Texas said in a statement.
Celedon also took a $6,000 bribe to allow vehicles with what he believed were kilograms of cocaine — but which was actually “sham cocaine” and part of an undercover investigation — into the U.S., the prosecutor’s office said.
Celedon's attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday afternoon.
He pleaded guilty Monday to four counts of bringing an undocumented alien to the U.S. in one criminal case and to counts of bribery and attempted importation of a controlled substance in the second, the U.S. attorney's office said.
The Juarez-Lincoln Port of Entry is one of five border land crossings in Laredo.

Officials in Allegheny County received multiple calls at 8:54 a.m. about a house explosion on Riverview Road in Crescent Township, just outside Pittsburgh.
The first unit arrived a few minutes after the call to find the home ""completely leveled by some type of explosion,"" county Fire Chief Andrew Tomer said at a news briefing.
He said there was a fire throughout the foundation and a fire alongside a nearby hill.
As authorities searched for the occupants, they found the bodies of the man and the woman, Tomer said. Abigail Gardner, the director of communications for Allegheny County, identified the victims as David Mitchell Jr. and Helen Mitchell.
No other injuries were reported.
The cause of the explosion remains under investigation. Tomer told reporters that there were ""natural gas on site from a private well"" and propane from a private well.
The blast was felt throughout the area, said Tomer, who called the explosion ""severe"" and ""absolutely extreme.""
""We all felt and heard the explosion,"" he said. ""Instantly, a column of white smoke up in the air followed by a thick column of black smoke. [It] was a very significant explosion. You could feel it in your chest. You could definitely feel the explosion.""
NBC affiliate WPXI of Pittsburgh reported that homes several miles away were damaged. Tomer said at least two other homes suffered damage but did not say how close they were to the explosion site.

2024-03-13T08:00:00.000Z,"Nearly 30% of Gen Z women identify as LGBTQ, Gallup survey finds",NBC News,"The percentage of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer adults in the U.S. continues to increase, reaching an all-time high of 7.6% in 2023, according to a new Gallup report. Broken down by gender, the survey of 12,000 people 18 and older across the country found that women were nearly twice as likely as men to identify as LGBTQ.
“Almost 30% of Gen Z women identify as LGBTQ+, most as bisexual,” Jeffrey Jones, a senior editor at Gallup, told NBC News. “That’s where a lot of the growth seems to be happening.”
This is the first year Gallup has laid out its annual LGBTQ identification report in a way that breaks down each generation by gender. Looking at all generations, 8.5% of women and 4.7% of men identified as LGBTQ, the survey found. The survey reported margins of sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points among LGBTQ respondents.
Parsing each generation, the gender story gets more interesting. In the three younger generations surveyed — Generation Z, millennials and Generation X — women are more likely than men to identify as LGBTQ. However, in the two oldest generations — baby boomers and the Silent Generation — it is reversed. (The gender breakdown does not account for nonbinary respondents, who represented about 1% of those surveyed.)
The group most likely to identify as LGBTQ, by far, was Generation Z women (ages 18 to 26), 28.5% of whom identified as LGBTQ in the survey. The lion’s share of them, of all Gen Z women surveyed, 20.7%, identified as bisexual, followed by 5.4% who identified as lesbians. Gen Z women were nearly three times more likely than Gen Z men to identify as LGBTQ.
Bisexuals made up the highest percentage of LGBTQ respondents, at 57.3% — or 4.4% of all adults surveyed. Gay men represented 18.1% of LGBTQ respondents, lesbians 15.1% and transgender people 11.8%, the survey found.
“It’s important how much the LGBTQ community is bisexual, and that’s definitely something we see among the younger generations,” Jones said.
Jones also noted that the survey allows respondents to write in their identities if they are not among the provided options, and he said more people are writing in “pansexual” and “asexual,” though they are still a small proportion of respondents — 3% of LGBTQ respondents and 0.2% of total respondents.
As Gallup has noted in its previous annual surveys, younger generations are far more likely to identify as LGBTQ than their older counterparts.
“Overall, each younger generation is about twice as likely as the generation that preceded it to identify as LGBTQ+,” says the report, which was published Wednesday. “More than one in five Gen Z adults, ranging in age from 18 to 26 in 2023, identify as LGBTQ+, as do nearly one in 10 millennials (aged 27 to 42).”
Only 1% of those in the Silent Generation, the youngest of whom are in their late 70s, identified as LGBTQ.
Since Gallup started measuring the U.S. LGBTQ population in 2012, when 3.5% of respondents identified as part of the community, there has been a consistent increase. Jones expects the trend to continue.
“Sometime in the next 10 to 30 years, we’ll hit 10%,” he said.
How soon that happens, he added, depends partly on the life span of those in the Silent Generation, who are the least likely to identify as LGBTQ, at just over 1%.

2024-03-09T03:35:51.571Z,"Dead Ohio man's roommates drove body to withdraw money from his bank account, police say",NBC News,"Two roommates of a recently deceased man were each charged with abusing a corpse after propping up his body to withdraw money from his bank, police said.
The pair, Loreen B. Feralo, 55, and Karen Kasbohm, 63, found the man dead Monday and took his body to a bank where they had previously accompanied him, Ashtabula Police Chief Robert B. Stell said in a statement.
With the help of a third, unnamed person, the roommates carried the body to the front seat of the dead man's car so bank staff could see him, and drove to the familiar bank branch, where they withdrew an undisclosed amount, the chief said.
The pair previously withdrew money from the man's account with him present and approving, Stell said. The chief told the Star Beacon, a daily news platform in Ashtabula, the suspects used the bank's drive-thru teller window.
The alleged caper unraveled when the duo dropped the body off at Ashtabula County Medical Center after the withdrawal and left quickly — without giving hospital staff information about the man, Stell said in the statement.
One of the two later called the facility with some of the man's story, he said, and the body was identified as Douglas Layman, 80, the chief said.
Officers went to Layman's Ashtabula home, where the roommates told them about the bank trip, Stell said.
The suspects have appeared in court, police said, though it was not clear if they entered pleas or were assigned attorneys. The county public defender's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
NBC affiliate WKYC of Cleveland, about 60 miles southwest of Ashtabula, reported Kasbohm's bond was set at $5,000, and Feralo was ordered to appear for arraignment next week.
Stell said in the statement that additional charges were possible. The county prosecutor's office did not respond to a request for comment.

2024-03-09T13:40:41.000Z,"Blue dragon season is upon us, but researchers remind beachgoers to think twice before touching them",NBC News,"CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas — Spring breakers flocking to Texas beaches this month could stumble upon a sight many have never seen — a bright blue and silver sea slug known as the blue dragon.
While the tiny, 1-inch creatures may look like fun, researchers warn that touching them could result in a painful sting.
“There’s all kinds of stories of people accidentally stepping on these blue dragons or picking them up and squeezing them and getting stung. And yeah, it doesn’t end well,” said Jace Tunnell, a marine biologist at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi.
Blue dragons, known scientifically as Glaucus atlanticus, sail on the surface of the ocean feeding on toxins from the Portuguese man-of-war and other jellyfish-like organisms. As southeast winds increase during the spring, the slugs blow ashore with the potential to release those dangerous toxins upon unsuspecting beachgoers.
“It would be 3 to 5 times what a man-of-war sting would be,” said Tunnell, who spotted one of the first blue dragons of the season on North Padre Island last month. The pain can last for up to three hours.
“You will know immediately if you are stung by a blue dragon,” Tunnell said. “It will be intense pain. It will feel like somebody has needles that they’re scraping across your skin.”
Blue dragons live in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans, but their habitat is expanding, according to American Oceans, an advocacy group that aims to educate the public about marine species. “Such examples are on the east and south coasts of South Africa, in European waters, near Mozambique, and off Australia’s east coast,” the group writes.
No definitive climate change connection has been made, but scientists say it’s likely a factor. “With warming temperatures, we would expect the blue dragon’s range to expand over time,” Tunnell said.
One reason we may be hearing about blue dragons more now is increased awareness. “I think we are just noticing them more,” he said.
Blue dragons can sting in the water if they feel threatened or agitated, and even after they come ashore and die. Many people don’t know that, and their first instinct is often to touch, as seen in videos on social media.
“That’s beautiful,” Sandy Harrison, who travels to Texas to escape winters in Nebraska, said while looking at a photo of the venomous slug. “I’d try to pick it up.”
Others, like Corpus Christi native Hannah Storbeck, know better. “It is cool looking, but I have heard that they’re really dangerous,” she said.
A bad reaction to a sting can cause vomiting and disorientation, prompting a trip to the emergency room.
“You don’t know how your body is going to react to the venom, and that’s the key,” Tunnell said. “Everybody’s body reacts differently.”
Researchers say if you’re stung, pour vinegar or warm water on the site, but don’t get in the ocean or rub it with sand.
Parents heading to the beach with small children should be extra cautious if there are blue dots peppering the shoreline, experts say, and chat with your child about not touching anything without asking an adult first.
“Take a photo, you know, make a little video of it or something like that. If you want to pick it up and put it in water to see it fan out, use a shovel.” Tunnell said. “But do not touch it.”

2024-03-09T12:00:41.000Z,This group brings free coding education to low-income NYC students,NBC News,"Tucked away in the red-brick community center of the South Jamaica Houses in New York City is a small multipurpose room filled with plastic chairs and tables. A piece of paper taped on the door shows the schedule for the day, with Hood Code starting at 3 p.m.
Right on time, the quiet room fills with giggles and sneaker squeaks as children pile into the space, each one excitedly talking over the other.
Hood Code is an organization that provides free coding classes to students who live in New York City’s public housing. These apartments are home to more than half a million low-income families and individuals, and 25% of them are under the age of 18.
Founder Jason Gibson said Hood Code was specifically designed to be in these neighborhoods and serve this community.
“I wanted to make it easily accessible to the families that live here,” Gibson said.
The workshops introduce the basics of coding to kids ages 8 to 13, and have so far taught about 300 children in housing buildings throughout the city. The programming also helps them develop problem-solving skills, self-confidence and innovative thinking.
The students primarily use Scratch, a free block-based language program that allows them to express themselves creatively and learn the basics of how professional coders create some of their favorite video games and apps.
Many of the kids embark on quests to make their own video games or re-create their favorites, finding inspiration in games like Flappy Bird and Geometry Dash.
Gibson founded Hood Code in 2019, but the idea for the program was born two years prior — from behind bars.
While serving a five-year sentence, Gibson spent most of his time expanding his knowledge and researching both the tech industry and African American history.
“That was my first opportunity to really sit down and read,” Gibson said. “And I realized how much of a disadvantage I was at and how kids from my neighborhood are in.”
Those disadvantages inspired Gibson to provide his community with opportunities that he says he wished he had growing up.
“I think my life could have possibly been different,” Gibson said. “I’ve always been an entrepreneur, I’ve always had that spirit. I could have been maybe one of the big tech founders.”
Gibson used that entrepreneurial spirit to gather sponsors and community members to ensure that Hood Code would be free for students and a paid job for tutors, many of whom are in high school.
“Coding is not always necessarily accessible to kids that we teach,” Chigo Ogbonna said. She’s a high school senior and a tutor at Hood Code. She and her friend Sara Outar decided to take on the job together.
“I think it’s because we both come from low-income communities, we understand. I didn’t have a computer until basically high school, when I had to do online school. And I didn’t even know that jobs in coding existed,” Outar said.
Black people made up 9% of the STEM workforce in 2021, according to the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics. A 2021 Pew Research analysis found that Black and Latino adults are less likely to earn STEM degrees than degrees in any other field, and they make up a lower share of STEM graduates compared to other populations.
“I think the passion, the drive that these kids have is something that you don’t see in your ordinary kid, because I know that they had to work 10 times harder to be here,” Ogbonna said.
With $200,000 from The David Prize, a no-strings-attached award given to New York-based innovators that the organization won in 2022, Gibson said he is more determined to continue expanding Hood Code’s programming.
“I wish people knew about some of the creativeness that the students have, the ambitions that the students have, the abilities that the students have, and the interests,” Gibson said. “I think people have stereotypes or their own beliefs about neighborhoods like these in general, and a lot of times they’re wrong.”

2024-03-11T22:27:11.338Z,An Alabama police officer was disciplined after he arrested a woman for refusing to show her ID,NBC News,"A police officer in Alabama has been disciplined after he arrested a woman at her home because she refused to show him her identification.
City leaders have condemned the arrest of Twyla Stallworth, 40, in February and ordered the entire Andalusia Police Department to receive additional training in city ordinances and constitutional and state law.
Stallworth had called police to her home on Feb. 23 on a noise complaint, she said, because a neighbor was playing music too loudly. The music stopped when police visited the neighbor's house but resumed after they left, Stallworth said.
She then went out to her car and purposely turned on the alarm to draw her neighbor's attention, she said. Then another neighbor began playing music loudly, and police soon arrived at Stallworth's home.
Cellphone video shot by Stallworth's son, Jermani Marshall, 18, and released by her attorney, Harry Daniels, shows Andalusia Police Officer John G. Barton standing at Stallworth’s doorstep asking for her identification.
“Ma’am, I’m not arguing with you. Provide ID or go to jail,” Barton says in the video.
She said she refused because she did not believe she had to provide identification.
Alabama law allows a police officer who reasonably suspects a crime is being committed to ask for people's names and addresses and explanations of their actions, but it does not say anything about showing identification, such as driver's licenses or passports.
“I’m going to jail? For not providing my ID?” Stallworth responds in the video.
Then Barton orders Stallworth to put her hands behind her back because he is placing her under arrest, the video shows.
Instead, Stallworth walks inside her home. Barton follows, along with Marshall, who can be heard in the background telling his mother that everything is OK and that he is recording the encounter with his cellphone.
After a brief exchange, Barton warns Stallworth it is her last chance to show her ID. Then he shoves her down onto her couch and handcuffs her, the video shows.
She was charged with resisting arrest, obstruction of governmental operations and attempting to elude police, according to court documents.
In a video posted on the city's website, Mayor Earl Johnson condemned Stallworth’s arrest and said the police department would undergo the additional training.
“All charges against Ms. Stallworth are being dropped,” Johnson said in the video. “The arresting officer has a clean record with our department, but he made a mistake. He has been disciplined for failing in his duty to know the law.”
He did not say how Barton was disciplined and could not be reached Monday for comment.
Police Chief Paul Hudson declined to comment by phone Monday. He said in an emailed statement that  Barton “was given a reprimand” but was not suspended.
Requests for a copy of Stallworth’s arrest report were largely unsuccessful. Hudson provided only the first page, which did not include details of the encounter between Barton and Stallworth.
Under Alabama law, police departments have broad authority to withhold arrest reports.
Stallworth, who is Black, said she believes her arrest may have been racially motivated because both of her neighbors involved in the dispute, who are white, were not arrested.
""My power was taken from me. I wasn’t able to fight back,” Stallworth said. “I wasn’t able to protect my son. I felt powerless. Nobody should be treated this way.”
Johnson said the city found no evidence of discrimination.
“We have reviewed bodycam footage of the incident and see no evidence of racism,” Johnson said in the video.
Stallworth, a real estate agent who grew up in Andalusia, about 90 miles south of Montgomery, said she spent 15 hours in jail before her mother came up with more than $3,000 in cash to bond her out.
Stallworth said she has been complaining about her neighbors’ playing loud music for the past two years.
Daniels said: “She was manhandled and slammed on the couch. She wasn’t required to show identification. It was an unlawful arrest.”
He said Stallworth is considering whether to sue the city and its police department.

The Riverside County Sheriff’s department confirmed her death Wednesday and said they found Bernard in an open field behind a business. Cause of death has not been revealed and local detectives are investigating.
Bernard, born May 26, 1959, in Gladewater, Texas, was drawn to performance from a young age. She got her start singing gospel songs with her younger sister Crystal, who went on to star on the 1990 sitcom “Wings.” Bernard was credited as Bernard Robin for her first credited role in Jean-Jacques Beneix’s stylish 1981 French hit “Diva.”
She would go on to guest star on shows such as “Whiz Kids,” “The Facts of Life” and “Simon and Simon.”
Bernard started on “General Hospital” in September 1984. During her time on the drama series, which holds the record for the longest running American soap opera in production, she played feisty Terry Brock, aka Terry O’Connor. Her character would develop a drinking problem that crippled her music career. She exited the show in March 1990 when Terry landed a recording deal and left the town of Port Charles.
While still working on “General Hospital,” Bernard reunited with Beneix for a small role in his 1986 French romance “Betty Blue,” which would go on to score a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and a BAFTA.
After her days on “General Hospital,” Bernard worked infrequently as an actor, appearing in the French miniseries “Maigret” in 1992 and in a Gallic film entitled “Kings for a Day” in 1997. Her final role was as a psychologist in the 2002 film “Voices from High School.”
Bernard is survived by her sisters Crystal and Scarlett as well as her father Jerry Wayne Bernard.

2024-03-13T18:23:13.190Z,A new film tells Frida Kahlo's story in her own words for the first time,NBC News,"Frida Kahlo's distinct image and iconic paintings are omnipresent art symbols recognizable by most people even 70 years after her death, creating a false sense that everything there is to say about the Mexican painter has already been said.
But filmmaker Carla Gutiérrez cuts through that by doing what no one has done before in retelling the legendary artist’s story on-screen: use Kahlo's own words.
In her new documentary film ""Frida,"" Gutiérrez uses the painter’s illustrated diary, intimate correspondence and candid print interviews to verbalize the artist’s innermost thoughts. Those emotions beautifully come to life through the lyrical animation of Kahlo's unforgettable artwork.
The combination of these elements in Gutiérrez’s feature film directorial debut results in a refreshing narrative that is as introspective as Kahlo’s paintings, most of which are self-portraits.
“I really felt that there was an intimacy that we could capture with our film and bring her in a different way to viewers,” Gutiérrez told NBC News. “For us, it was about always capturing the essence of Frida and her spirit.”
In the film, the earnest delivery of voiceover actor Fernanda Echevarría del Rivero closely resembles Kahlo, based on the only recording believed to contain the sound and tone of the artist’s voice.
Considering that Kahlo’s voice remained a complete mystery for years, this artistic choice by Gutiérrez allows the audience to feel an even bigger affinity to Kahlo, as if she was the one telling us her deepest secrets from her childhood and her adulthood.
The voiceovers are effectively used to deliver poignant revelations about Kahlo and her life. At times, they are so personal, it almost feels like we should not be listening to them.
In her letters and diary, Kahlo wrote about the ups and downs of her relationship and marriage to acclaimed muralist Diego Rivera, her romance with the Russian revolutionary Leon Trotsky, and some of her first memories questioning the Catholic faith, as well as gender roles.
Viewers also get to go inside Kahlo's mind as she recovered from a life-threatening accident that left her with fractures in her spine, leg, collarbone and pelvis — injures that resulted in multiple miscarriages and dozens of surgical procedures later in her life.
""There is a way of approaching biographies where you just list all the things that happen in somebody's life. But for me, it's really more important to capture the spirit of somebody and the emotional journey of that person,"" Gutiérrez said.
To accomplish this, she and her team got unrestricted access to research materials that have never been shown to the general public before.
It took them two years to parse through everything and create a unique cinematic experience for those who have loved Kahlo for years and others who are just learning about her legacy.
Gutiérrez said the experience of reading Kahlo's writings and getting to know about her feelings firsthand ""made me really feel her a lot, in a closer way, in a more intimate way.”
“It just made her into a more normal woman that is facing the normal things that we all face,” she said.
Audiences get to see, hear and feel a multitude of Kahlos — at times rebellious and seductive, fearless and defiant, lonely and vulnerable, insecure and fragile.
As a woman who lived with physical disabilities, explored and challenged gender norms, remained politically active and lived a tumultuous love life, the film provides a satisfying ending that makes us gain a new understanding of Kahlo's last painting: a still life of watermelons with the Spanish words ""Viva la Vida"" (Live Life).
It brought meaning to ""that symbol, that sometimes is a little bit reductive,"" Gutiérrez said.
""Frida"" will be available to stream on Amazon starting Thursday.

2024-03-13T20:59:20.198Z,QVC apologizes for 'You'll love this bag longtime' promotional email,NBC News,"Home shopping giant QVC apologized last week after many customers spoke out against an email that they described as “racist” toward the Asian American community.
QVC president Mike Fitzharris issued on Friday an apology on behalf of the company, following a marketing email sent earlier in the day that promoted a handbag with the subject line, “You’ll love this bag longtime,” according to the email viewed by NBC News.
The shopping organization had drawn backlash for what appeared to be a play on the phrase, “Me love you long time,” words that have been used to demean Asian women since the late ‘80s. And with the email coinciding with International Women’s Day, many said they felt the line was particularly offensive.
“Earlier today, you received a marketing email for our Today’s Special Value that used derogatory language that is offensive, particularly to the Asian community and women, in the subject line,” Fitzharris said. “I am personally sending this email because I want to apologize deeply that this happened. It runs counter to our values and principles as an organization and is in no way reflective of our commitment to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, something that makes us stronger as an organization.”
The company did not elaborate further on the issue in response to an NBC News request for comment.
The phrase, “Me love you long time,” and any riffs on it, have long drawn the ire of those in the Asian American community. The words, made famous by Stanley Kubrick’s 1987 fictional war movie “Full Metal Jacket,” are uttered by a Vietnamese sex worker, played by actress Papillon Soo, who also says the similarly offensive line, “Me so horny.” Many Asian Americans have since argued that the film only confirmed the problematic, reductive stereotype of Asian women as hypersexualized and subservient.
Fitzharris said that the company is making adjustments to prevent anything similar from happening again.
“This will be done closely with our Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion team to ensure we provide diverse perspectives and reviews with our language,” he said in the apology email. “We need to do better, and we will do better. I am sorry we didn’t do better today.”

It's not clear why the bus veered into oncoming traffic about 11:30 a.m. on Route 24, she said. State police took over the investigation, and the National Transportation Safety Board said it was sending a team to Rushville to assist.
Sheriff Bill Redshaw said the loss was quickly felt in the area of the crash, Schuyler County, which has a population of less than 7,000 and occupies 441 square miles on the west side of the state.
""It’s a close-knit family,"" he said, describing his community. ""To have loss of life like this, it’s devastating.""
The bus was headed east, and the truck, transporting sand, was going west when the collision happened, according to Huffman and a state police statement.
U.S. Route 24, a major thoroughfare for the county that ultimately connects it to Kansas City, Missouri, was the subject of an ""extended closure"" as authorities continued to investigate what caused the bus to move into oncoming traffic, the agency said.
The weather was fair with clear skies at the time of the crash, according to National Weather Service data.

2024-03-11T19:51:58.331Z,American Academy of Dermatology votes to keep its diversity policies after anti-DEI proposal,NBC News,"The American Academy of Dermatology on Sunday voted to reject a proposal to end its diversity, equity and inclusion programs, in what Black dermatologists are calling a small victory for the organization and the field in general.
The academy, a nonprofit organization of dermatologists in the U.S. and Canada, has been embroiled in DEI-related controversy since February, when dozens of members co-authored a resolution looking to put an end to DEI initiatives and programs being implemented in the institution. The group called the resolution “Sunsetting all diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs” and held that the “DEI movement” would do more harm than good to the branch of medicine. News of the resolution spread quickly, with several news outlets detailing the diversity battle brewing in the AAD.
In the latest turn Sunday, the advisory board not only voted to reject the resolution, but to expand the academy’s mission to prioritize diversity and address inclusion issues within the field.
“We celebrate diversity in all forms including, but not limited to, religious, ethnic, cultural, gender, and racial identities and aim to improve disparities in health care,” academy president Terrence Cronin Jr. told NBC News in a statement through a spokesperson. “We are ardent opponents of any form of antisemitism, Islamophobia, anti-Asian hate, and racism of any kind.”
The vote came two days after the board heard testimony from several dermatologists, of many races, who opposed the resolution. Wendy Roberts, a California-based dermatologist, said she believes hearing from the dermatologists may have cemented the board’s decision to oppose the anti-DEI resolution.
“Department chairs stood up and talked about how their programs were stronger because of DEI. They felt diversity made their programs better,” Roberts recalled. She said she was disappointed to see her colleagues and people she considered friends sign on to the anti-DEI resolution. “The turnout for supporting DEI was massive and I was so proud of dermatology.”
Black dermatologists make up just 3% of dermatologists in the country, research shows. This disparity can lead to misdiagnosis and mistreatment from white doctors who may not know or understand how skin ailments manifest in darker skin. The AAD has taken steps to address these disparities with programs specifically intended to create and support more dermatologists of color. One of those initiatives is its Diversity Mentorship Program, in which medical students from underrepresented groups team up with a dermatologist of their choice for a month of one-on-one mentorship.
The board voted during the 2024 AAD Annual Meeting this weekend in San Diego. The board heard from academy members on Friday and issued their decision on Sunday. Roberts said the atmosphere at the meeting was initially tense, with the prospect of the academy ending its DEI programs hanging in the air. Afterward, she said the mood lightened up and Black dermatologists and other minority practitioners gathered to make a social media video yelling, “We belong here.”
The resolution in dispute was introduced by Brian Raphael, a dermatologist in East Syracuse, New York. According to Raphael, the resolution links the “DEI movement” to antisemitism and DEI efforts have evolved into an unfair political movement that stifles “diversity of thought” and creates a “racist” or “nonracist” binary.
“DEI, while initially well-intentioned, is now believed to hinder rather than help the diversity in our specialty and the broader healthcare field, and to obstruct efforts to address and improve racism within our systems,” his resolution reads.
Raphael did not immediately respond to a request for comment from NBC. He said in a statement to Allure that the resolution wasn’t received in the way he intended.
“The original intent of the proposal was always to work with our colleagues and the AAD/A to adopt an even more inclusive policy, one that promotes the end of racism and hate speech — and supports the equal treatment and respect of all individuals, especially within the health care system,” he told Allure.
After learning of the initial resolution, Roberts, the California doctor, teamed up with two other dermatologists, Jeanine Downie, who is Black, and Heidi Waldorf, a Jewish white woman, to put forth a counter-resolution: “Opposition to the Resolution to Dismantle/Remove The Current American Academy of Dermatology Association (AADA) Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Initiative.” They also launched a petition to expand rather than end the AAD’s DEI initiatives. The petition garnered more than 6,000 signatures.
Waldorf said the matter isn’t a battle between Jewish people and Black people, but the original resolution appeared to be an effort to undermine and dismantle DEI and use outrage over recent antisemitic incidents to do it.
“It was misguided, and I think, in my opinion, it hid a political agenda. There was an agenda to stop DEI and they tagged on antisemitism to get people to sign,” Waldorf told NBC News in an interview. “It started as a debacle. I’m very proud of the American Academy of Dermatology members for seeing what was the right thing to do for public health.”
Conservative politicians, lawyers, activists and social media influencers have spent recent years countering DEI initiatives in several industries. After the murder of George Floyd in May 2020 and the national protests that followed, companies, schools and organizations have sought to become more racially and socially inclusive. Those efforts have prompted a backlash and a right-wing push against “wokeness,” with anti-DEI advocates calling such policies and programs unconstitutional.
A recent NBC News Analysis found that Republican lawmakers in more than 30 states have introduced or passed more than 100 bills to either restrict or regulate DEI initiatives in the current legislative session. The anti-DEI efforts follow, and have gained momentum from, the backlash to Black Lives Matter and the implementation of laws to limit what can be taught about race in schools.
Starling Tolliver, a dermatology resident at Michigan’s Wayne State University, participated the AAD’s Diversity Mentorship Program in 2019. She said she was devastated last month when she learned that the anti-DEI resolution could have led to the end of the academy’s program.
“It really just saddened me,” Tolliver told NBC News of the initial resolution, “because it really does not represent what DEI is. To say you want to dismantle it is taking it out of context and disregarding all the amazing things it’s done for people.”
“I would not be where I am without these policies,” she added.

2024-03-13T19:22:40.207Z,Rats are 'all high' on marijuana stored in infested New Orleans police evidence room,NBC News,"Rats have gotten into the confiscated marijuana at the vermin-infested and decaying New Orleans Police Department headquarters, the city's top cop warned.
""I want you to see the tray of all of the roaches, major rodents on the floor, the cockroaches, the rats eating our marijuana. They're all high,"" Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick told the Criminal Justice Committee on Monday about the evidence room.
The current department headquarters houses substandard facilities with broken air conditioners and elevators. Officers ""have nowhere to use a restroom,"" according to Kirkpatrick.
""We all know the facilities have been rundown,"" Councilmember and Criminal Justice Committee Chair Oliver Thomas told NBC News affiliate WDSU. ""Last year, it was so hot that we had to close the buildings. Sometimes it’s so cold that our officers and the rank at headquarters can’t even occupy the building.”
The deplorable conditions date back to 2008, according to the WDSU investigative team. In the latest 2017 report, photos from inside the facility show snakes, rodents, possums and possible mold.
“The uncleanliness is off the charts,” Kirkpatrick said Monday, and the janitors “deserve an award for trying to clean what is uncleanable.”
A proposal has been put forward to spend $7.6 million on a 10-year lease to temporarily relocate the police headquarters to two floors in a downtown building. Other criminal justice agencies may soon need to follow suit.
""I imagine you’re going to see similar situations where we may have to temporarily lease space as we eventually build a finalization for the future,” Chief Administrative Officer Gilbert Montano said during the meeting.
The Criminal Justice Committee voted in favor of advancing the leasing proposal to the full City Council for a final decision.

2024-03-10T06:45:34.872Z,"Despite being found liable for attack, Trump claims E. Jean Carroll made 'false accusations' against him",NBC News,"ROME, Georgia — Former President Donald Trump on Saturday reiterated his claim that writer E. Jean Carroll had levied “false accusations” against him, even as similar remarks have resulted in large court judgments against him.
Speaking at a Georgia campaign rally that represented Trump’s pivot toward the general election as he seeks to prevent a second loss to Democratic President Joe Biden, Trump reiterated a number of grievances, Carroll’s civil court victories among them.
“I just posted a $91 million bond, $91 million on a fake story, totally made-up story,” he said, referencing the bond he posted this week as he appeals a defamation verdict against him.
“Ninety-one million based on false accusations made about me by a woman that I knew nothing about, didn’t know, never heard of, I know nothing about her,” he continued.
“She wrote a book, she said things,” Trump told the raucous crowd in Rome, about 70 miles northeast of Atlanta. “And when I denied it, I said, ‘It’s so crazy. It’s false.’ I get sued for defamation. That’s where it starts.”
At issue for Trump has been Carroll’s allegation that he raped her during an encounter in the dressing room of a New York department store in the 1990s and then defamed her by calling her account a “hoax” and a “con job.”
In May, a jury did not find Trump liable for the alleged rape but awarded Carroll $5 million after finding the former president liable for sexually abusing and defaming her.
A separate case focused on similar comments Trump made about Carroll while in office and concluded he defamed her when casting doubt on her story. U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan said that case would be about determining damages — later adjudged to be $83.3 million — as the abuse was factual.
Trump is appealing both cases.
The judgments did not appear to dissuade him from returning to his denials of her account. On Saturday, Trump said that Carroll “is not a believable person” and that Kaplan — whom he called “a terrible person, a terrible judge” and “highly corrupt” — knows as much.
Trump blamed “Democratic operatives” for his defamation woes, and called the city where he and his father bought, sold, traded and developed real estate projects for the better part of a century a crooked metropolis.
“New York is a very corrupt place,” Trump said.
It did not appear Carroll had responded to Trump’s latest denials of her story as of early Sunday.

2024-03-13T17:29:07.374Z,"One person killed after huge fire ignites Michigan warehouse, raining debris 'as far as a mile away,' police say",NBC News,"A man was killed after an enormous fire Monday night at a suburban Detroit warehouse, known to stock combustible materials, ignited explosions, shook homes and rained down debris as far as a mile away, officials and residents said.
Authorities on Tuesday evening appeared to be focused on butane and nitrous oxide canisters they said were stored illegally at the warehouse in Clinton Township, which housed a distributor of vaporizer pens, smoke shop items and convenience and dollar store goods.
""We know they were not allowed to have these canisters,"" Paul S. Brouwer, the township's emergency management coordinator, said at a news conference Tuesday night. ""They were not permitted to have them in this building.""
The 19-year-old man who was killed was identified Wednesday night by the Macomb County Corporation Counsel as Turner Lee Salter. He was at a nearby car wash, possibly observing the commotion, as canisters rained on the community even after the explosion was reported at 8:50 p.m., officials said.
Officials said the man was hit in the head and taken to the hospital, where he died.
Clinton Township Fire Chief Tim Duncan said firefighters had trouble accessing the building “due to the hundreds, if not thousands of explosions.”
First-responder vehicles rushing to the scene were struck by canisters, he said. Officials earlier said at least some of the canisters measured 12 inches.
""We had a number of fire engines and police vehicles that were hit,"" Duncan said. ""Somebody was looking out for us.""
A firefighter was injured by debris that flew through his windshield and struck him in the face, officials said. The firefighter was treated at the hospital and released.
Canisters have been discovered as far as 2 miles away, with officials saying 25 had been collected by early Tuesday evening. They said residents had been seen collecting them, possibly as souvenirs, and warned that the items were potentially explosive and deadly.
Everyone at the warehouse, where some workers assigned to the business' web-based sales were working, evacuated safety, officials said.
Emergency services were called at 8:50 p.m. to the warehouse, which housed the vape wholesale business Select Distributors and a vape and nitrous oxide brand under a wholesaler called Goo.
On its website, Select Distributors says it supplies novelty items and phone accessories to dollar stores and that it sells vape products, nitrous oxide and CBD oils. Goo calls itself a smoke shop and says it and sells tobacco, smoking paraphernalia and other items, according to NBC affiliate WDIV of Detroit.
A spokesperson for the company said in a statement Select Distributors was ""deeply saddened"" and expressed ""its sincerest condolences to the victim’s family.""
""It is actively cooperating with investigators as they work to determine the cause of the accident. Select Distributors has been a proud employer and member of this community for over a decade and is focused on ensuring safety and support of its team members and community,"" the spokesperson said.
Select Distributors' website says it sells butane wholesale, in boxes that contain 12 to 20 canisters, with some of the canisters containing 10 ounces of gas.
The volatile gas is used to refill lighters, but it's also popular with often-illegal cannabis concentrate makers who spray butane into cylinders packed with marijuana to extract butane hash oil, the core of concentrated cannabis products that can pack potent highs when smoked, vaped or eaten.
The process has resulted in countless explosions, often involving illicit home labs.
The distributor also openly sells nitrous oxide, which is largely unregulated. It is not a Drug Enforcement Administration scheduled drug, and the Food and Drug Administration has approved it as a prescribed medication and as a propellant and aerator in dairy products, mainly whipped cream. Goo brands a nitrous product called Power Hitter, according to the Select Distributors website.
The gas, sometimes sold for recreational use at vape shops and adult bookstores, can also be explosive. Its use as an oxygenator in rocketry was connected to a 2007 accident at a facility at Mojave Air and Space Port in California that killed three people. That year in suburban Detroit, a suspect described as a distributor of recreational nitrous oxide was successfully prosecuted for improperly labeling nitrous oxide cylinders.
In Clinton Township, two business owners were taken to the police department Monday night and interviewed by the fire prevention division and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, Duncan said.
Witnesses affiliated with Select Distributors were cooperating with investigators, officials said at Tuesday evening's news conference. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Duncan told reporters that the business had recently received a semi-load of butane containers and had “over half of that still left.” There were also pallets of nitrous, lighter fluid and over 100,000 vape pens that had lithium batteries inside them, he said.
Barry Miller, the township superintendent for building inspections, said at Tuesday night's news conference that the location was the subject of one recent violation — improper storage of duck boats — which was corrected under a township warning. ""We didn't know the canisters were on-site,"" he said.
WDIV reported that it received calls from viewers who said they heard explosions as far away as the town of Troy, 15 miles to the west, in neighboring Oakland County. Clinton Township is in Macomb County.
Some callers said items inside their homes rattled and shook from the vibrations.
Eyewitnesses captured the scene from afar and posted video to social media with the sound of multiple, sustained explosions as projectiles shot out into the sky. One person said the explosions continued for more than half an hour.
A witness, Marie Ainsworth, said she had just sat down in her basement when she felt ""the whole world, Earth shaking.""
""I didn’t know if we were at war,"" she said.
When Ainsworth went outside, she saw thick smoke billowing in the air.
""It was pretty bad, and it was scary,"" she said. ""It never stopped. It never stopped. The explosions never stopped.""
Clinton Township Supervisor Robert Cannon told reporters that he lives 5 ½ miles away and that the explosion sounded like ""thunder right over our home.""
""That's 5 ½ miles away, so think about the people that were near the site,"" he said. ""It was horrible. The ground was shaking. Our trucks were going to the site and the trucks were shaking. That's how bad it was.""
Duncan said the warehouse was almost completely burned down. The property was fenced off, and authorities continued to scour a 2-mile radius for debris, officials said.
Officials initially told residents to stay inside with their windows closed. A Macomb County hazmat team monitored the air Monday night ""with negative results, so the air is fine,"" said Brouwer, the emergency management coordinator. He said the water was also ""absolutely perfect.""

Only one person, someone in the van, survived the crash, which was reported at 7:53 a.m. in Dewhurst Township, around 45 miles southeast of Eau Claire, the Clark County Sheriff's Office said in a statement.
The crash occurred when an eastbound tractor-trailer on Highway 95 hit a van going northbound on intersecting County Road J, the sheriff's office said.
The driver of the tractor-trailer was killed, and eight of the nine people in the van, including the driver of that vehicle, also died, the office said. They were all pronounced dead at the scene.
Gov. Tony Evers said said on X that he and his wife were saddened by the tragic crash.
""Our hearts and prayers go out to the families and loved ones of all those involved, as well as the first responders who worked quickly to provide support at the scene,"" Evers said.
The surviving passenger of the van was taken to a hospital for treatment, the sheriff's office said in the statement. Their condition was not announced.
The names of the dead were not released Wednesday night pending notification of next of kin, the sheriff's office said.
Video from the scene and from the air showed severe damage to both vehicles.
The van was on its side, and the front of the semi was mangled as the big rig and its load lay in a ditch by the highway, partially on its side.

He was 78.
Alexander's death was announced on a GoFundMe set up to help him with finances.
""I am so gratitude to everybody who donated to my brother's fundraiser,"" Philip Alexander said on the GoFundMe. ""It allowed him to live his last few years stress-free. It will also pay for his funeral during this difficult time. It is absolutely incredible to read all the comments and know that so many people were inspired by Paul. I am just so grateful.”
""His story traveled wide and far, positively influencing people around the world. Paul was an incredible role model that will continue to be remembered,"" GoFundMe organizer Christopher Ulmer wrote on Tuesday.
The cause of his death was not mentioned. Alexander, who lived in Dallas, Texas, was rushed to the hospital in late February after testing positive for Covid, according to his social media manager. He was released from the hospital but was struggling to eat and drink.
Alexander was declared the longest surviving iron lung patient last March by the Guinness World Records. He contracted polio during an epidemic of the debilitating disease in the 1950s as a child living in Texas.
Despite his condition, Alexander graduated from college with a law degree and ran his own legal practice. He also became a published author with the book ""Three Minutes for a Dog,"" detailing his life.
In recent months, Alexander started a TikTok account calling himself ""Polio Paul,"" where he talked about his accomplishments and answered questions about life in an iron lung. The account had over 300,000 followers at the time of his death.

2024-03-11T16:29:59.846Z,Lori Loughlin parodies her college admissions scandal on ‘Curb Your Enthusiasm’,NBC News,"Lori Loughlin cheats at golf and flexes a bogus handicap permit in the latest episode of “Curb Your Enthusiasm,” which features a hilarious cameo from the “Full House” star poking fun at her role in the 2019 college admissions scandal, for which she served a two-month prison sentence.
Loughlin became the face of the Varsity Blues scandal when she and her husband, Mossimo Giannulli, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud after they were accused of paying $500,000 to get their daughters into the University of Southern California, using falsified athletic profiles.
They were among dozens of parents swept up in the investigation of admissions consultant Rick Singer, who admitted to bribing and cheating in order to get his clients’ children into prestigious universities.
In Sunday’s “Curb Your Enthusiasm” episode, titled “The Gettysburg Address,” Ted Danson asks Larry David if he would do him a favor by helping Lori gain admittance to his country club by sponsoring her. Learning she’s been blackballed by the local clubs because of her role in the scandal, Larry eagerly agrees, saying, “You know I’m a champion of the underdog.”
Soon enough, he’s passionately delivering a plea to the members of Ocean View Country Club in the style of Abraham Lincoln’s famous speech about freedom and equality.
“I highly resolve that she shall not have served her time in vain, and that this exclusive club of specific people, by specific people and for specific people shall have a new specific member,” Larry says as the board gives him a standing ovation.
But Larry soon regrets endorsing Lori, who skirts the “cart path only” rule on her first day of golfing by showing off an exemption. “You gotta have a doctor’s note to get one of those,” Larry says, to which Lori replies: “I have Epstein-Barr … one hematologist thinks so.” After golf, Lori flexes the undeserved handicap sticker on her Porsche and advises Larry to work on his short game.
On the next round, Larry learns that Lori was able to secure a coveted tee time by bribing the starter with $50. And, toward the end of the game, Larry questions Lori’s honesty when it comes to keeping score. “How’d you get it out of the woods? You were pretty deep in there,” he presses.
“I had a good lie,” Lori says, to which Larry mutters: “Yeah, you had a good lie, all right.”

2024-03-12T17:52:37.229Z,Texas superintendent suspended after trans student's removal from ‘Oklahoma!’,NBC News,"The superintendent of a Texas school district has been suspended after a transgender student was removed — and then later reinstated — from a role in a high school production of ""Oklahoma!""
The Sherman Independent School District School Board of Trustees voted Friday to suspend Superintendent Tyson Bennett during a closed session. Meghan Cone, a spokesperson for the district, confirmed Tuesday that the decision was related to an investigation into the trans student's removal from the musical.
Bennett did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The student, Max Hightower, a senior at Sherman High School, was removed in November from the lead male role in “Oklahoma!” after his family was notified of a new policy about casting by gender.
“There is no policy on how students are assigned to roles. As it relates to this particular production, the sex of the role as identified in the script will be used when casting,” the district said in a statement on Nov. 6.
On Nov. 10, ""after further review,"" the district revised its original rule, saying ""sex will not be considered when casting the new production.""
Later that month, the district reversed the restrictions altogether after the school board unanimously voted to reinstate the original script and cast.
“We understand that our decision does not erase the impact this had on our community, but we hope that we will reinforce to everyone, particularly our students, that we do embrace all of our Board goals, to include addressing the diverse needs of our students and empowering them for success in a diverse and complex world,” the board's president, Brad Morgan, said at the time.
The board of trustees adjourned to a closed meeting Friday so members could consult an attorney on the “personnel matters” and the “investigation concerning ‘Oklahoma!’ production issues,” according to the board's public agenda. The meeting lasted more than three hours.
In addition to suspending Bennett with pay, the board appointed Deputy Superintendent Thomas O’Neal as acting superintendent, effective immediately.
Max’s father, Phillip Hightower, said he supports the board's decision to suspend Bennett.
“I don’t celebrate a man likely losing his job, but I am glad the board made the right decision to keep our students, all of our students, free from discrimination of any kind,” he said.

2024-03-11T23:14:39.364Z,Chinese American WWII vets who served despite being denied U.S. citizenship honored by Congress,NBC News,"Chinese Americans who fought in World War II were honored on Saturday with a Congressional Gold Medal ceremony. Six veterans gathered at the National WWII Museum in New Orleans to accept the honor on behalf of the thousands of their peers that served in the war. It’s the highest recognition Congress can give to a U.S. civilian.
Around 20,000 Chinese Americans served during WWII, though upon their return to the U.S. they faced rampant discrimination and laws like the Chinese Exclusion Act, which made it impossible for most Chinese immigrants to become citizens. Since the act wasn’t repealed until 1943, it meant many Chinese members of the U.S. armed forces weren’t citizens at the time of their service in WWII.
In 2018, after a push by Chinese veterans groups, Congress passed a bill collectively honoring them with a Gold Medal, the highest recognition Congress can give to a U.S. civilian. The ceremony was supposed to be held in Washington but was delayed by the pandemic. Similar recognition has been given to Japanese and Filipino American WWII veterans in previous years.
Six of these Chinese American veterans, many now in their 90s, were honored Saturday as they were called one-by-one to accept their medals. The representatives present to accept the medals were a mix of U.S.-born Chinese servicemembers and immigrants from China who were later drafted.
“I’m very honored and humbled to be selected to do this,” said Arthur T.S. Shak, an Army veteran from Hawaii. “We are so grateful. … Mahalo to the National WWII Museum president.”
The other five honorees were William Shih Yin Ching, Wai Hoo Tong, Donald T.S. Lee, Harry G. Jung and Wing Fook Joseph Li.
Robert M. Lee, another Chinese American WWII vet, told NBC News in 2020 that joining the army was his only choice. As a recent immigrant to the U.S. from China, he was unable to enroll in school or find work, so he enlisted at just 14 years old.
At the time, Lee said he’s happy about the efforts to recognize his fellow Chinese American WWII veterans. But he wishes it had come sooner.
“I was elated on my behalf, of course, but very disappointed that it was so late that many people would not live long enough to receive it,” he said in 2020.

2024-03-11T21:57:41.683Z,Why some say it’s significant ‘Godzilla Minus One’ won an Oscar the same year ‘Oppenheimer’ did,NBC News,"For many Japanese Americans, the Oscar win for “Godzilla Minus One” on Sunday symbolized much more than just a place in the halls of film excellence.
The kaiju monster movie, which takes place in a postwar Japan that’s grappling with devastation and loss, took home the prize for best visual effects, the first Academy Award in the franchise’s 70-year history. Against the backdrop of a ceremony dominated by “Oppenheimer,” a film focused on the man behind the atomic bomb, many Japanese Americans say the win for “Godzilla Minus One” felt like a small acknowledgment of their historical pain.
“There’s so many movies that try to humanize these people who’ve done horrific things,” said Dylan Adler, a Los Angeles-based comedian of Japanese descent. “But there’s so little media or movies at all talking about the Japanese civilians that died in the trauma that [the bombings] caused. That is why ‘Godzilla’ the movie — I love that it also won an Oscar the same year that ‘Oppenheimer’ did.”
“Godzilla Minus One” follows kamikaze pilot Koichi, who fails to follow through on a suicide mission yet, while returning from the battlefield, manages to miraculously survive the monster.
But upon his return home, he discovers that his parents and neighbors have died. Wrestling with his own survivor’s guilt as Godzilla continues to wreak havoc among civilians, Koichi seeks to redeem himself by going head-to-head with the monster.
The monster was historically written as a metaphor for the ills of nuclear weapons and atomic testing. William Tsutsui, the author of “Godzilla on My Mind: Fifty Years of the King of Monsters,” said its heavily furrowed skin or scales were imagined to resemble the keloid scars of survivors of the two atomic bombs the U.S. dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II. Though there’s no explicit focus on the atomic bomb in “Godzilla Minus One,” the film illustrates the enormous magnitude of grief that grips the country after the war.
Meanwhile, “Oppenheimer” — which took home seven Oscars for its portrayal of physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, the integral figure in the top-secret U.S. effort to make the first atomic bomb — has received heavy criticism for its absence of Japanese loss. In fact, in one scene, when Oppenheimer, played by Cillian Murphy, is giving a speech, he visualizes the members of his predominantly white audience as victims of the bomb. Others also criticized the film for portraying the burden of guilt around the weapons falling on Oppenheimer alone.
Nolan said he chose not to illustrate the aftermath of the bombings or the victims because “to depart from Oppenheimer’s experience would betray the terms of the storytelling.”
“He learned about the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on the radio — the same as the rest of the world,” Nolan said in a discussion with NBC News’ Chuck Todd. “That, to me, was a shock. … Everything is his experience, or my interpretation of his experience. Because as I keep reminding everyone, it’s not a documentary. It is an interpretation. That’s my job.”
For decades, Adler said, U.S. media has uplifted stories of American heroism and tragedy after the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, associating those of Japanese descent with Japanese imperial forces.
“It is just one side of the war. It truly is just the American, white side of the war,” Adler said. “That is the only perspective that is shown.”
Coupled with Japan’s own history of colonization, Adler said, speaking about the grief of Japanese people has almost felt taboo. But the recognition of “Godzilla Minus One” has felt like a bit of “catharsis,” he said.
“That was a film devised from the trauma of the two atomic bombs on Japanese civilians, and the fact that it did win an Oscar does make me hopeful,” he said.
Phil Sakanashi, an Irvine, California-based photographer, said he was heartened when he saw that the academy had recognized “Godzilla Minus One.” But he’s not quite ready to say the award symbolizes greater openness toward Japanese and Japanese American stories.
“Half my family’s in Japan, and half my family’s in the U.S. I’ve seen both sides. I’d love to see a broader understanding and recognition of what the people have gone through,” he said. “My grandfather in Japan, he died partially because of just the shame and the pain it caused him to fight for his country and to lose. And on the other side, my American side, my great uncle’s in the [442nd Infantry Regiment, made up of second-generation Japanese American soldiers], and I’ve had family in camps. It was devastating on both sides.”
Tsutsui said the original movie, released in 1954, drew laughs in theaters from American audiences, interpreted as a low-budget cheesy monster movie. The latest movie’s award at the Oscars could represent a shift in how some interpret Japanese cinema.
“Those of us who are baby boomers, who grew up with a certain stereotype of what a Godzilla movie is — that is to say, badly dubbed, poor special effects — we’re increasingly in the minority,” Tsutsui said. “People who are younger today and on the cutting edge are looking at movies for what they are, rather than as part of a much longer history. And they recognize ‘Godzilla Minus One’ is a great movie that had wonderful special effects. That, to me, is a very positive change.”
However, Tsutsui said he’s not so sure whether academy voters appreciated the movie beyond its special effects value.
“I think they just went and saw this movie and said it has great visual effects. … It really is the wonderful job that [director Takashi] Yamazaki and the team did,” he said.
And as positive as the night was for “Godzilla” fans, others still worry that the “Oppenheimer” sweep will send the wrong message.
“I understand the story [‘Oppenheimer’ director Christopher] Nolan was trying to tell was from Oppenheimer’s perspective, but to completely neglect the lived experiences of Japanese civilians by excluding all images of the actual destruction wrought by the atomic bombs has aligned this film within historic propaganda narratives and essentially justifies the existence of nuclear weapons,” said Rob Buscher, a longtime Godzilla fan and the executive director at the Japanese American Confinement Sites Consortium. “I personally believe that the success of ‘Oppenheimer’ will further erase the reality of human suffering from the discourse related to the atomic bomb.”

2024-03-13T04:02:21.949Z,Alaska Airlines plane whose door panel blew off midair was scheduled for maintenance,NBC News,"The Alaska Airlines plane that had a door panel fall off midair in January had been scheduled to undergo maintenance later that night, the airline confirmed Tuesday.
The incident on Flight 1282, which took off from Portland, Oregon, at 5:07 p.m. Jan. 5, resulted in no serious injuries but sparked an investigation that revealed no bolts were installed on the door plug of the Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft.
The New York Times reported earlier Tuesday that the plane was scheduled for a safety check after some engineers and technicians became concerned — including about a light indicating problems with the plane’s pressurization system — and that it was kept in service with some restrictions.
Alaska Airlines told the newspaper that the warnings it had on the plane did not meet its standards to immediately take it out of service.
Alaska confirmed to NBC News that the plane was scheduled to head for maintenance later the night of Jan. 5.
The airline said in a statement that it, like other airlines, relies on ""redundant systems, robust processes and procedures, and the willingness to stop and ensure things are right before every takeoff,"" and it said safety guides its decisions.
Flight 1282 was on a path from Portland to Ontario, California, when the door plug blew out at around 16,000 feet, officials said. The plane returned to Portland. Oxygen masks deployed as the plane made an emergency return.
Boeing has been under scrutiny following the failure of the door plug, which is a panel that seals where a door would be and makes it part of the fuselage. Some Boeing 737 Max 9 planes were temporarily grounded, and Boeing ousted the executive in charge of the 737 Max program.
The door plug was later found in the backyard of a Portland-area home.
The plane was delivered to Alaska Airlines on Oct. 31, and the airline put it into service on Nov. 11, the National Transportation Safety Board said in a preliminary investigation report.
The plane had 510 flight hours and 154 cycles, which is a flight from takeoff to landing, the agency said.
""We remain confident in our maintenance and safety actions leading up to the incident,"" Alaska Airlines said in the statement Tuesday. ""We look forward to continuing our participation in a robust investigation led by the NTSB to ensure something like this never happens again.""
There were 177 people aboard the plane, including flight and cabin crew members, and when the door plug fell off, it caused a rapid decompression, the NTSB said.
Seven passengers and a flight attendant sustained minor injuries, it said.
The NTSB announced Tuesday it will hold an investigative hearing on Aug. 6 and 7.

2024-03-13T00:43:00.283Z,Uvalde police chief announces resignation after report on Robb Elementary School shooting,NBC News,"The Uvalde, Texas, police chief announced his resignation Tuesday, days after a City Council report cleared several officers of wrongdoing in the delayed law enforcement response to the shooting at Robb Elementary School that killed 19 children and two teachers.
""After much contemplation and consideration, I believe it is time for me to embark on a new chapter in my career,"" Chief Daniel Rodriguez said in a statement.
""I have had the privilege of serving the City of Uvalde and its residents for the past 26 years, and it has been an honor to lead the dedicated men and women of our police department.""
Rodriguez did not address the report or the shooting itself in his statement. His resignation takes effect April 6.
Mayor Cody Smith said he was ""grateful"" to Rodriguez for his ""service to our community.""
Assistant Police Chief Homer Delgado will be named interim chief.
Last week, a City Council report cleared law enforcement of wrongdoing in the May 24, 2022, mass shooting after an analysis revealed that police waited 77 minutes for tactical gear to arrive while students remained locked inside a classroom.
In addition to the 19 students and two teachers who were killed, 17 other people were injured. The shooter was killed after a confrontation with police.
Jesse Prado, the Austin-based investigator and former police detective who wrote the report, said there were clear communication issues between Uvalde school district police and responding officers.
Prado said former Uvalde school district Police Chief Pete Arredondo “would make phone calls, but the officers had no way to know what was being planned or what was being said.” The investigation also found no evidence that the city’s police force — the focus of the investigation — committed any wrongdoing or failed to follow training.
In January, the U.S. Justice Department blamed the law enforcement response on a lack of leadership at the scene and a failure to follow accepted police protocol.
At a Uvalde City Council meeting Tuesday evening, parents of those killed said they were disappointed that the council was not going to act about whether to accept the report, as they were led to believe.
“You all told us last week you were going to give us some damn answers — and you’re still not giving us answers,” said Brett Cross, whose son Uziyah was killed. “Do you all accept it or not?”
Xavier Lopez, who was friends with Uziyah, would have turned 12 years old Tuesday, Cross said. It’s been almost two years since the shooting.
Smith the mayor, who sits on the council, said he understands the frustration, but the council needs more time to determine “what, if any actions we can take.”
“I know you all are sick of it, you all are sick of getting the can kicked down the road, man, and I feel you, I do,” Wheeler said. “But we have to have some more time.”
Veronica Mata, whose 10-year-old daughter Tess was murdered in the shooting rampage, was among those who told the council that they’ve waited long enough.
“We have waited almost two years now, and you keep asking us for more time. How much more time do you want us to wait?” she said, and she also questioned whether the council was stalling in the hopes the three officers would simply quit.
“These officers let our children down. Do the right thing and fire them,” Mata said.
Jesse Rizo, the uncle of Jacklyn Cazares, who was 9 when she was killed, said that the resigning police chief didn’t even mention the shooting in his resignation.
Rodriguez was not at Tuesday night’s council meeting.
“And what does Daniel do today? He doesn’t show up. Just like his crew didn’t show up that day,” Rizo said. Rizo said that the resignation letter “is all about Daniel — no accountability, no responsibility.”
Residents also voiced anger about the report’s findings at last week’s meeting.
Kimberly Mata-Rubio, who lost her 10-year-old daughter, Alexandria “Lexi” Rubio, said at that meeting: “How do all of you live with yourselves?
“How do you go to bed at night and then wake up every day? Shame on you all. You said they did it in good faith? You call that good faith? They stood there for 77 minutes and waited after they got call after call that kids were still alive in there,” she continued. “All this is it’s a pact. It’s a brothers’ pact. You protect your own.”

2024-03-08T22:46:01.477Z,"Tennessee farm worker finds severed pig's head at workstation after asking about pay, complaint states",NBC News,"The Department of Labor seeks to prevent a Tennessee farm from retaliating against employees after a severed pig’s head was allegedly left at a workstation, according to a complaint.
The department requested a temporary restraining order in a Feb. 21 filing in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee on behalf of Tosh Pork employees who asked about their wages.
Two employees, a husband and wife couple whose job duties typically include providing animal care for pigs on the farm in Henry County, asked their employer about pay and later filed a complaint with the DOL’s Wage and Hour Division in February 2022, according to the complaint.
After learning of the complaint, Tosh Pork allegedly tasked one employee with cleaning offices, bathrooms and picking up pig waste — all responsibilities outside of the worker’s normal job duties, according to the complaint.
Tosh Pork also allegedly tried to force both employees to sign a document forbidding them from speaking with coworkers about pay issues, the complaint states.
“Tosh Pork’s appalling actions and clear attempts to intimidate and retaliate against its employees will not be tolerated,” Tremelle Howard, a regional solicitor with DOL who is responsible for civil trial litigation, said in a statement.
Investigators also learned another worker who asked about wages was called to meet with the farm’s management and threatened with termination, the complaint said.
Returning to their workstation, they found a severed pig’s head, according to the complaint.
The legal action names Tosh Pork LLC and human resources manager Dianna Rosa as defendants in addition to asking the court to stop the company from violating the Fair Labor Standards Act.
Rosa could not be reached for comment on Friday.
“Tosh Pork denies it engaged in the retaliatory conduct alleged by the DOL,” Seth Krantz, a veterinarian speaking on behalf of the company, said in an email to NBC News.
The company seeks to follow all federal, state, and local regulations including the Fair Labor Standards Act, he said.
Federal law prohibits an employer from firing or discriminating against workers who have filed a complaint, are cooperating in an investigation or inquiring about pay, which is legally protected activity, the DOL said.
During its investigation, the agency also determined Tosh Pork failed to meet employment requirements for H-2A visa workers and corresponding American workers under the Immigration and Nationality Act, the complaint said.
The division found the employer owed five workers $39,375 in back wages and assessed $36,731 in civil money penalties, according to the DOL.
“Federal law protects employees who provide information to the U.S. Department of Labor,” Wage and Hour Division District Director Lisa Kelly in Nashville, Tennessee, said in a statement.
Tosh Pork, which owns 11,000 acres of land and produces swine and grows corn, soybeans, wheat, canola and barley, employs people from foreign countries to work on its farm, DOL said.

2024-03-08T20:21:59.465Z,Family of an Indiana mom who died on a plane are still dealing with 'uncertainty',NBC News,"The brother of Indiana mom Stefanie Smith, who died last week while flying home from vacation in the Dominican Republic, said Friday that they still don’t know what killed her.
“I’d say the uncertainty, the not knowing how she died, the not knowing when her body will be returned to us, has been the hardest thing recently,” Chris Volz told NBC News. “It’s been a week so we’re past the initial shock. But now, it’s the uncertainty.”
Volz said the family has picked out a tentative date for his sister’s “celebration of life,” but they still have no idea when the hospital in the Turks and Caicos will release her body and have not heard from American Airlines, the carrier Smith was flying on when she died Feb. 28.
""We are hoping to find out soon,"" Volz said.
The flight that Smith was on made an emergency landing on Turks and Caicos after the 41-year-old mother of two became ill. She was taken to the Cheshire Hall Medical Centre, where she died, according to The Royal Turks and Caicos Islands Police Force.
NBC News reached out to the hospital, whose spokesperson Daniel LeVin said the police are fielding all questions about Smith. The police have not yet responded to an inquiry from NBC News.
Volz said he was not aware of his sister, who lived in Danville, having any pre-existing health conditions. He said she was an avid exerciser who continued to work out even while on vacation with her boyfriend in the Dominican Republic.
""She also coached cheerleading and softball, when her kids were younger,"" Volz said. ""She was very active. Right before she left, she took a picture with everyone and there was no indication that she was sick.""
Smith had been on vacation in the Dominican Republic for five days when she and her boyfriend boarded a flight for Charlotte, North Carolina, where she was to take a connecting flight back to Indiana.
The young mom was sitting beside her boyfriend when she suddenly started going into convulsions, Volz said he was told.
""At 6:12 pm, the Police Control Room received a call from the Air Traffic Control Tower requesting medical assistance for a 41-year-old female, who at the time was receiving Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR),"" the Turks and Caicos police said in a statement posted on Facebook.
Joe Oyler, a firefighter from Wisconsin who was on the flight, told NBC News he heard the commotion at the back of the plane and volunteered to help when he learned a woman was having a medical emergency.
""But by then several people were already trying to revive her,"" said Oyler, adding that the plane crew appeared to have responded quickly to the emergency.
Volz said that his family has been struggling to come to grips with what happened.
""My sister was the kind of person who saw the best in everybody,"" he said. ""She was very much into her relationships with her family, with her friends. She put smiles on peoples' faces.""

2024-03-12T18:22:00.000Z,"California lawmaker introduces bill to remove artificial dyes from cereals, baked goods and other foods served in school",NBC News,"A state legislator introduced a first-of-its-kind bill Tuesday that would ban seven additives from the foods that are served in California’s public schools.
Assembly Bill 2316 would prohibit school cafeterias from offering foods containing six artificial food dyes that have been linked to hyperactivity and behavioral issues in some children. It would also outlaw titanium dioxide, a whitening agent used in candies and other products that is banned by the European Union because of concerns that it is potentially genotoxic, meaning it may damage DNA and cause cancer.
The bill, which was first shared with NBC News, would affect certain cereals, condiments and baked goods, among other foods, and it would make California the first state to ban the additives from schools. It was introduced by Democratic Assemblymember Jesse Gabriel.
""This legislation will not ban any specific foods or products,"" Gabriel said Tuesday at a virtual news conference. ""The goal here is to encourage companies to make minor modifications to products sold in California if they want their products to be sold in California public schools.""
The necessary recipe tweaks would be as small as changing one ingredient, Gabriel told NBC News, adding that many products sold on grocery store shelves use natural substitutes such as turmeric, beet juice or pomegranate juice for coloring.
Synthetic dyes “are nonessential ingredients,” Gabriel said in a phone interview before introducing the bill. “These are chemicals that are added to food to make them appear more appealing. But for all of them, there are specific alternatives.”
In addition to titanium dioxide, the bill would ban Red 40, Green 3, Blue 1 and Blue 2, and Yellow 5 and Yellow 6 in foods served by schools.
The Food and Drug Administration has said it has not established a causal relationship between behavioral problems and synthetic dyes for children in the general population who haven’t been diagnosed with conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
But Gabriel said a comprehensive assessment from the state of California showed otherwise. The 2021 evaluation found an association even in some children without ADHD diagnoses.
“Overall, our review of human studies suggests that synthetic food dyes are associated with adverse neurobehavioral effects, such as inattentiveness, hyperactivity and restlessness in sensitive children,” the authors of the assessment wrote. “The evidence supports a relationship between food dye exposure and adverse behavioral outcomes in children, both with and without pre-existing behavioral disorders.”
The bill comes as the number of ADHD diagnoses has risen nationally in recent years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Gabriel, whose son has ADHD, said he found it baffling that schools would serve foods that could increase symptoms of the disorder.
“It just totally harms these kids and undermines our investment in helping them when we expose them to chemicals that we know are going to exacerbate their challenges,” he told NBC News.
AB 2316 would go into effect at the beginning of 2025 if it is signed into law this year.
The FDA had no immediate comment on the bill. The International Association of Color Manufacturers, a trade association, pointed to its past statements on food dyes, including one that rebutted the 2021 findings from California, in which it said that concluding that there may be an association between synthetic colors and negative health or behavior is “based on insufficient scientific evidence.”
The International Food Additives Council, another trade group, condemned state-level bans on ingredients that have been determined to be safe by the FDA.
‎“FDA is the federal agency charged with ‎safeguarding the food supply, and those ‎advocating for state bans are undermining FDA’s ‎authority and causing unnecessary consumer ‎confusion,“ the council’s executive director, Robert Rankin, said in a statement, adding that the council “stands ‎behind the FDA in its mission to uphold the highest standards of food safety.”‎
But Melanie Benesh, vice president of government affairs at the Environmental Working Group, a research and advocacy health organization that is co-sponsoring Gabriel’s bill, argued that the FDA is “asleep at the wheel.”
“California shouldn’t have to introduce this bill,” she said. “In an ideal world, we would have a credible federal regulator that would be taking aggressive action to make sure that the food chemicals that we are exposed to every day, and the foods that we eat, and the foods that we feed our family, are actually safe.”
An analysis by the Environmental Working Group found that if the bill passes, only a handful of items sold in California schools would be affected. Benesh said the group estimated that the additives that would be banned are only in about 4% of foods served in cafeteria lunch lines and less than 3% of items sold through à la carte lines. À la carte items are snacks and drinks that students can purchase separately from their school meals.
“There are some categories like cookies, chips, sugary breakfast cereals, that may be more likely to be tainted by these food chemicals and these colors,” Benesh said. “But even in those categories, there’s plenty of alternatives.”
The proposed legislation follows last year’s passage of the California Food Safety Act, which was also introduced by Gabriel and banned four food additives linked to potential health problems. The law was the first time that a state had outlawed chemicals allowed by the FDA and means that, beginning in 2027, California will prohibit red dye No. 3, potassium bromate, brominated vegetable oil and propylparaben from being in any food sold in the state.
Other states have since followed suit. Bills attempting to ban certain food additives have been introduced in Illinois, Missouri, New York and Washington state, among other places.

2024-03-11T15:53:16.607Z,'Godzilla Minus One' director responds to 'Oppenheimer' plot as a 'person of Japanese ancestry',NBC News,"Following his historic Oscar win, the director of “Godzilla Minus One,” which deals with the devastation of the atomic bombings of Japan in World War II, responded to a question about his thoughts on “Oppenheimer,” a portrayal of the American scientist responsible for the deadly weapon.
“As a person of Japanese ancestry and descent, my response to ‘Oppenheimer’ [is that] I would like to dedicate a different film to that when that day comes,” Takashi Yamazaki — whose film won the Oscar for best visual effects, the first for the “Godzilla” franchise — told reporters at the Academy Awards on Sunday.
“Godzilla Minus One,” the 37th installment of the iconic Toho Studios franchise, follows civilians in postwar Japan as the monster re-emerges amid their grief. The monster itself, experts say, was originally created as a metaphor for the ills of atomic weapons and testing, with its heavily furrowed skin or scales imagined to resemble the keloid scars of the Japanese survivors of the two atomic bombs.
“Oppenheimer” dominated the Oscars with seven wins for its portrayal of physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, director of the clandestine weapons lab in Los Alamos, New Mexico, which was part of the top-secret U.S. effort to make the first atomic bomb. But the film also got mixed reactions for its erasure of the hundreds of thousands of Japanese victims of Oppenheimer’s creation.
Nolan said he chose not to illustrate the aftermath of the bombings or the victims because  “to depart from Oppenheimer’s experience would betray the terms of the storytelling.”
“He learned about the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on the radio — the same as the rest of the world,” Nolan said in a discussion with NBC News’ Chuck Todd. “That, to me, was a shock. … Everything is his experience, or my interpretation of his experience. Because as I keep reminding everyone, it’s not a documentary. It is an interpretation. That’s my job.”
Yamazaki told reporters that the simultaneous success of the two films and the “juxtaposition was not intentional.”
“As we were making the film, the state of the world and the geopolitical scene has changed quite a bit. It almost feels fated that both of these films were released in the same year,” he said.

2024-03-09T13:51:04.055Z,Bayard Rustin’s connection to queer history may have started with his very name,NBC News,"The movie “Rustin” has finally shone a proper spotlight on the life and crucial work of civil rights pioneer Bayard Rustin, picking up abundant accolades along the way that include an Oscar nomination for its lead actor, Colman Domingo.
Created for and embraced by wide audiences, Netflix’s “Rustin” biopic openly incorporates its title character’s sexuality, revealing how Rustin’s refusal to hide his gayness likely prevented him from taking a more prominent place — at least publicly — in the struggle for Black equality in America.
Rustin has also long been revered for his vital contributions to queer culture and history, first as an unapologetically out gay man within the greater civil rights movement, and later as a vocal advocate for LGBTQ rights in particular.
But Rustin’s connection to queer culture may have stretched back even further, indeed to the very beginning of his life. Born Bayard Taylor Rustin in West Chester, Pennsylvania, in 1912, he was named after Bayard Taylor, the man some now credit with having written America’s first gay novel some four decades earlier.
At the time of Rustin’s birth, Taylor was West Chester’s most famous son, thanks to his eminent career as a writer and diplomat. Likely just as importantly for Rustin’s grandmother Julia, who named him, Taylor had come from West Chester’s Quaker community, as had she.
Born in 1825, Taylor first rose to national fame as a poet and travel writer, publishing several books of poetry and travel essays in the 1840s and ‘50s. He published his first novel in 1863, followed by two more that same decade.
By 1876, Taylor’s prominence was so great that he was commissioned by Philadelphia’s Centennial Exhibition to write an official poem honoring America’s 100th birthday. The crowd of more than 4,000 people that gathered on July 4 to hear Taylor recite his “National Ode” gave him the largest-ever audience for a poetry reading, a record that would stand for the next 85 years.
A few years earlier, in 1870, Taylor had published his fourth novel, “Joseph and His Friend: A Story of Pennsylvania,” serialized chapters of which also appeared in The Atlantic Monthly. At the center of the book’s plot lay the extraordinarily close and undeniably homoerotic bond between two young men, Joseph Asten and Philip Held, who fatefully meet after eyeing each other up on a train ride through eastern Pennsylvania.
A few years older than the struggling-to-conform Joseph, and already made wiser by a stint on America’s western frontier, Philip “argues for the ‘rights’ of those ‘who cannot shape themselves according to the common-place pattern of society,’” wrote Robert K. Martin in the 2002 edition of the criticism anthology “The Gay and Lesbian Literary Heritage.”
In a pivotal scene from the novel, Philip takes Joseph’s hand, draws him nearer, flings his arms around him and holds him “to his heart.”
“O Philip, if we could make our lives wholly our own!” Joseph laments. “If we could find a spot—”
“I know such a spot!” Philip gushes back. “A great valley, bounded by a hundred miles of snowy peaks; lakes in its bed; enormous hillsides, dotted with groves of ilex and pine; orchards of orange and olive; a perfect climate, where it is bliss enough just to breathe, and freedom from the distorted laws of men, for none are near enough to enforce them! … I will go with you, and perhaps—perhaps—”
Long held as a prime example of late 18th century romantic male friendship in literature, in recent decades “Joseph and His Friend” has been reinterpreted by some LGBTQ writers and scholars as America’s first gay novel.
“Even post-Stonewall there was a hesitation to say ‘Joseph and His Friend’ was a homosexual novel, let alone America’s first,” observed author L.A. Fields in her 2017 book, ‘The Annotated Joseph and His Friend: The Story of America’s First Gay Novel.’ “But it is still the strongest candidate.”
Fields told NBC News that any earlier books with “glimmers of masculine fixation” were either not American, like James Hogg’s anonymously published “The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner” from Scotland in 1824, or not explicit enough to qualify as a gay novel, like 1799’s “Edgar Huntly, Or, Memoirs of a Sleepwalker” by Charles Brockden Brown.
The latter, like Taylor’s “Joseph and His Friend,” is set in rural Pennsylvania, but its obsessive male fixation revolves around the main character’s murdered friend — “not someone living whom he dreams of running away with and kisses, a startling scene which does take place in ‘Joseph,’” Fields said.
Like many scholars, Fields said she believes Taylor based “Joseph and His Friend” on the real-life relationship between early 19th century poet Fitz-Greene Halleck — sometimes called “the American Byron,” and whose statue graces the Literary Walk in New York’s Central Park — and his beloved friend Joseph Drake.
“For someone like Bayard Taylor who admired Halleck from a young age both personally and professionally as a writer, it seems like a very obvious inspiration, even if he never explicitly affirmatively declared it, as far as we know,” Fields explained. “Halleck’s relationship with Drake was the making of his life and literary career, and Drake’s loss, first to marriage and then to death, forever colored Halleck’s outlook.”
As for Taylor’s own sexuality, the evidence is somewhat murkier. He married twice and fathered a daughter, but he also maintained an unusually strong friendship with a German businessman named August Bufleb — whom he met on a train, perhaps foreshadowing the meeting between the characters of Joseph and Philip.
“Bufleb built him a special guest house on his property so that Taylor would visit him, and Taylor later married this man’s niece so they could be family,” Fields said.
“Joseph and His Friend,” the last of Taylor’s novels, was not particularly well received by critics of its day, though it’s unclear whether that owed more to its quality or its inclusion of a jarringly close male relationship.
“It is an unpleasant story of mean duplicity and painful mistakes,” wrote Taylor’s biographer, Albert H. Smyth, of the book in 1896. “The characters are shallow and their surroundings mean. There is not a single pleasing situation or incident.”
Plenty of readers must have disagreed, because by 1893, “Joseph and His Friend” had been reprinted eight times and translated into German. According to a widely shared newspaper account following Taylor’s death in 1878, the novel even became a main topic of discussion between Taylor and Germany’s Chancellor Otto von Bismarck when they were first introduced, with the German leader telling the author what he disliked about the book, and Taylor defending his literary choices.
When they met again by chance a few days later, von Bismarck was re-reading “Joseph and His Friend” and had already changed his mind about the story. “On the whole, I think you’re right about it,” he told Taylor.

2024-03-08T21:30:50.266Z,2 former Texas deputies acquitted in death of man who was tased following police chase,NBC News,"Two former Texas sheriff’s deputies were acquitted of all charges in the death of a Black man who was tased several times following a police chase that was captured on the reality television show ""Live PD.""
James Johnson and Zachary Camden, two former deputies with the Williamson County Sheriff’s Office, were found not guilty by a Travis County jury just after 8 p.m. Thursday, defense attorney Ken Ervin said.
They were cleared on charges of manslaughter, criminal negligent homicide, and assault in the March 2019 death of Javier Ambler.
Ambler, 40, died in police custody after he was tased four times. He had told the deputies he had heart issues and could not breathe.
The verdict was handed down following a nine-day trial. After the decision was announced, Ambler’s father, Javier Ambler Sr., embraced Johnson and Camden and said ""no hard feelings"" before leaving, NBC affiliate KXAN of Austin reported.
Travis County District Attorney José Garza said he had hoped the outcome of the trial ""would bring justice and closure"" for Ambler’s family.
""Our hearts continue to break for the family of Javier Ambler,"" he said in a statement. ""We are grateful to our community members who served on the jury for this case, respect their decision, and thank them for their service.""
Ervin said Friday that Camden and Johnson’s records will be expunged.
The younger Ambler had led authorities on a 22-minute chase after Williamson County deputies tried to stop him for failing to dim his headlights for oncoming traffic, according to a police report. The chase began in Williamson County around 1:30 a.m. on March 28, 2019, and ended in north Austin.
Austin Police Department also responded to the scene. At the time, the former A&E reality television show ""Live PD"" was filming sheriff’s deputies.
Body camera video from an Austin police officer showed Ambler on the ground with several officers. An officer told Ambler to give him his hands or he would be tased again, according to the video.
Ambler told authorities that he had congestive heart failure and that he could not breathe. He was restrained and tased at least three times.
His manner of death was declared a homicide, according to a custodial death report filed with the Texas Office of the Attorney General. Ambler died of congestive heart failure and hypertensive cardiovascular disease associated with morbid obesity, in combination with forcible restraint, the report said.
Ambler's family filed a wrongful death lawsuit in 2020, alleging that sheriff’s deputies engaged in a reckless chase of Ambler to make entertaining television for ""Live PD."" A&E canceled the show in 2020.
In 2021, the county reached a $5 million settlement with Ambler's family.
Both Camden and Johnson resigned shortly after then-Williamson County Sheriff Robert Chody lost reelection in November 2020.

2024-03-11T16:24:10.966Z,Christina Applegate says she lives 'kind of in hell' with multiple sclerosis,NBC News,"Christina Applegate is opening up about living with multiple sclerosis, the unpredictable and potentially debilitating disease she was diagnosed with in 2021.
“I live kind of in hell. I’m not out a lot, so this is a little difficult, just for my system. But of course, the support is wonderful, and I’m really grateful,” the actor said in an interview with “Good Morning America.”
Applegate received a standing ovation at the Emmys in January when she appeared on stage with a cane as a surprise presenter. She cracked a joke about her condition saying, “You’re totally shaming me with disability by standing up, but it’s fine.”
The ""Dead to Me"" and ""Anchorman"" star admitted she “kind of blacked out” in that moment.
“People said, ‘Oh, you were so funny,’ and I’m like, I don’t even know what I said. I don’t know what I was doing. I got so freaked out that I didn’t even know what was happening anymore,” Applegate said in the interview.
“I felt really beloved, and it was a beautiful thing,” she added.
Jamie-Lynn Sigler accompanied Applegate in the interview. Sigler herself was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis when she was 20 years old. The two are now hosting the new podcast, “MeSsy.”
Applegate first shared her diagnosis in 2021 through social media. The actor has since given fans updates about her health.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease of the central nervous system that disrupts the flow of information between the brain and body, according to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. The immune system attacks the body's nerve linings, producing unpredictable symptoms including pain, fatigue or even paralysis.

2024-03-09T04:45:51.538Z,"Judge upholds program that allows 30,000 migrants from 4 countries into the U.S. each month",NBC News,"HOUSTON — The Biden administration can keep operating a program that allows a limited number of migrants from four countries to enter the U.S. on humanitarian grounds after a federal judge on Friday dismissed a challenge from Republican-led states.
U.S. District Judge Drew B. Tipton said Texas and 20 other states had not shown they had suffered financial harm because of the humanitarian parole program that allows up to 30,000 asylum-seekers into the U.S. each month from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela combined. That was something the states needed to prove to have legal standing to bring the lawsuit.
“In reaching this conclusion, the Court does not address the lawfulness of the Program,” Tipton wrote.
Eliminating the program would undercut a broader policy that seeks to encourage migrants to use the Biden administration’s preferred pathways into the U.S. or face stiff consequences.
The states, led by Texas, had argued the program is forcing them to spend millions on health care, education, and public safety for the migrants. An attorney working with the Texas attorney general’s office in the legal challenge said that the program “created a shadow immigration system.”
Advocates for the federal government countered that migrants admitted through the policy helped with a U.S. farm labor shortage.
The White House welcomed the ruling.
“The district court’s decision is based on the success of this program, which has expanded lawful pathways for nationals from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela who have a sponsor in this country and pass our rigorous vetting process, while dramatically decreasing the number of nationals from those countries crossing our Southwest Border,” White House spokesperson Angelo Fernández Hernández said.
The Texas Attorney General’s Office did not immediately reply to messages seeking comment. An appeal by Texas and the other states seemed likely.
Since the program was launched in fall 2022, more than 357,000 people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela have been granted parole and allowed to enter the country through January. Haitians have been the biggest group to use the program with 138,000 people from that country arriving, followed by 86,000 Venezuelans, 74,000 Cubans and 58,000 Nicaraguans.
Migrants must apply online, arrive at an airport and have a financial sponsor in the U.S. If approved, they can stay for two years and get a work permit.
President Joe Biden has made unprecedented use of parole authority, which has been in effect since 1952 and allows presidents to let people in for “urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit.”
Esther Sung, an attorney for Justice Action Center, which represented seven people who were sponsoring migrants as part of the program, said she was looking forward to calling her clients to let them know of the court’s decision.
“It’s a popular program. People want to welcome other people to this country,” she said.
Valerie Laveus, one of the seven represented by Justice Action Center, sponsored her brother and nephew and they arrived in Florida from conflict-plagued Haiti last August. They are flourishing in their new lives, she said, and her nephew has a newfound normalcy and is able to do things like play basketball outdoors without having to worry about safety. Her brother is working in construction.
Laveua said she is grateful for the legal outcome and people entering the country through the program are contributing to society.
“I am ecstatic, not just for my family but for all the other families who are still waiting,” she said.
During an August trial in Victoria, Texas, Tipton declined to issue any temporary order that would halt the parole program nationwide. Tipton is an appointee of former President Donald Trump who ruled against the Biden administration in 2022 on an order that determined who to prioritize for deportation.
Some states said the initiative has benefited them. One Nicaraguan migrant admitted into the country through the process filled a position at a farm in Washington state that was struggling to find workers.
Tipton questioned how Texas could be claiming financial losses if data showed that the parole program actually reduced the number of migrants coming into the U.S.
“The Court has before it a case in which Plaintiffs claim that they have been injured by a program that has actually lowered their out-of-pocket costs,” Tipton said in Friday’s ruling.
When the policy took effect, the Biden administration had been preparing to end a pandemic-era policy at the border known as Title 42 that barred migrants from seeking asylum at ports of entry and immediately expelled many who entered illegally.
Proponents of the policy also faced scrutiny from Tipton, who questioned whether living in poverty was enough for migrants to qualify. Elissa Fudim, a lawyer with the U.S. Department of Justice, responded: “I think probably not.”
Federal government attorneys and immigrant rights groups said that in many cases, Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans are also fleeing oppressive regimes, escalating violence and worsening political conditions that have endangered their lives.
The lawsuit did not challenge the use of humanitarian parole for tens of thousands of Ukrainians who came after Russia’s invasion. It is among several legal challenges the Biden administration has faced over its immigration policies.
The program’s supporters said each case is individually reviewed and some people who had made it to the final approval step after arriving in the U.S. have been rejected, though they did not provide the number of rejections that have occurred.
Friday’s decision “is a clear win and affirmation of humanitarian immigration parole being an indispensable, necessary and model program of the type of smart solutions we should be focusing on to relieve pressure on the border and modernize our failed immigration system,” said Todd Schulte, president of immigration advocacy organization FWD.us.

2024-03-13T18:29:18.849Z,"Teacher allegedly tosses 2-year-old 'like a piece of luggage,' sending student into a wall",NBC News,"A former teacher at a child care center in Middletown is accused of tossing a 2-year-old child “like a piece of luggage” into a wall at the facility and has been arrested.
Middletown police said it happened at Town & Country Early Learning Center at 195 South Main St. on Jan. 12.
They started the investigation that day when the child’s guardian went to police to ask that the teacher be arrested after the facility notified her about the assault and allowed her to watch internal surveillance video of the incident, according to police.
Police identified the teacher as Kristie Kovarcik, 47, of Haddam. Town & Country reported that Kovarcik was terminated from her job, according to police.
The guardian of the 2-year-old told police what she saw.
She said the child fell to the ground, then Kovarcik grabbed the child’s shirt with both hands, picked the child off the ground and launched the 2-year-old “through the air like a piece of luggage,” the arrest warrant says.
According to police, the director of the facility heard an elevated voice when it happened, pulled up the surveillance camera for Kovarcik’s room and saw children “wrestling.”
Kovarcik was standing there, allowing the children to wrestle, which is not allowed. Then she picked the child up off the ground by the back of the student's shirt, threw the child off to the side, and there was a loud thud as though something hit the wall, the director told police.
The director then ran into the room and found the child crying.
Kovarcik said the victim was fine, according to the arrest warrant.
The director removed the child and reported the incident to the parents and the state Department of Children and Families.
Detectives obtained the surveillance video and found that it confirmed that Kovarcik picked up the child, tossed the student to the side and the child’s head hit a nearby wall, causing a minor contusion above the right eye, police said.
The arrest warrant says the child was thrown around six feet.
Kovarcik has been charged with risk of injury to a minor and reckless endangerment in the second degree.
She said in a statement that it was “chaotic,” children were pushing and pulling each other and the 2-year-old was climbing on top of another child, according to the arrest warrant. So, Kovarcik said, she grabbed the victim, moved the child out of the way and the child’s head hit the wall.
Kovarcik said in the statement that it was not intentional, she was remorseful and admitted to losing her cool, the arrest warrant says. She had worked at the day care since 2019.
Police said they reviewed some video footage with the day care director and video from Nov. 1 showed Kovarcik shove someone, the arrest warrant says, and video from Jan. 8 showed Kovarcik lift a young child out of a chair by the shirt and drop the child to the ground, kick a victim who was on the ground and push onto a child’s chest to force the child to lie down at naptime.
“Upon observing the incident involving Ms. Kovarcik on our internal camera monitoring system, we immediately initiated an internal investigation, notified the appropriate state authorities, and terminated the employee. Our safety and training protocols are amongst the strictest in our industry and we treat any such incident with the utmost seriousness. The safety and protection of the children in our care is always our top priority,” a spokesperson for Town & Country Early Learning Center, said in a statement.
The Office of Early Childhood released a statement on Tuesday afternoon.
“The Office of Early Childhood (OEC), the state agency that licenses child care programs, became aware of this unfortunate incident and conducted a joint investigation with DCF. While the program is currently in legal for failing to substantially comply with the Regulations, the resolution to the legal matter is pending. The OEC takes these situations very seriously and we take every measure needed to ensure the health and safety of children,” the statement says.
Kovarcik turned herself in to the police on Feb. 26.
She is due in court on April 2.
Police obtained video footage from the day care from Oct. 11 through Jan. 12 and they are going through it, according to police.

2024-03-12T19:50:56.822Z,Longtime LGBTQ activist David Mixner dies at 77,NBC News,"LGBTQ activist and political adviser David Mixner, perhaps best known for challenging then-President Bill Clinton’s “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy, died Monday, a close friend confirmed. He was 77.
“A champion for equality, longtime activist David Mixner’s unwavering voice spanned decades,” Kelley Robinson, president of the Human Rights Campaign, the nation’s largest LGBTQ advocacy group, wrote on X. “From challenging discriminatory policies to influencing presidential campaigns, his work paved the way for a new political reality and will inspire generations.”
While Mixner spent decades advocating for LGBTQ rights, he’s probably best known for challenging Clinton — for whom he served as a campaign adviser — on the controversial “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy.
Mixner was the first openly gay man to hold a public-facing role on a presidential campaign, according to the LGBTQ+ Victory Fund, a nonpartisan nonprofit advocacy group that Mixner co-founded in 1991. However, their relationship soured after Clinton enacted the “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy, which barred gay men and lesbians from serving openly in the military, in 1993.
Mixner joined about 100 activists to protest “don’t ask, don’t tell” outside the White House that year, leading to his high-profile arrest.
“I just have to do what is right,” he told The Washington Post at the time. “I have buried too many friends to compromise. I owe it to them. I owe it to my partner, who died four years ago.”
“He doesn’t have a voice anymore, and I must speak for him,” Mixner added. “That’s what this is all about.”
The controversial policy would remain in place for another 17 years, until Congress and President Barack Obama repealed it in 2011.
Mixner rose to prominence for working with Clinton, but his political activism long predated the former president.
As a teenager he volunteered for John F. Kennedy’s presidential campaign, according to an interview he gave to LGBTQ magazine Metro Weekly in 2004. Mixner and his partner, Peter Scott, were among those who led the opposition to a 1978 California ballot measure — Proposition 6, also known as the Briggs Initiative — which would have barred gay men and lesbians from teaching in the state’s public schools. Mixner said in the same interview that he met with Ronald Reagan, who had been governor from 1967-1975, and pushed him to publicly oppose the ballot measure.
“A closeted gay Republican got us a meeting, at great risk to his own political self,” Mixner told the magazine at the time, referring to his meeting with Reagan. “It was a delightful meeting — I was treated in that meeting with more respect than almost any other elected official I’ve ever met with.”
Voters later rejected the ballot measure.
Mixner later became a prominent AIDS activist and was reportedly among dozens of protesters arrested outside of the White House in 1986, lambasting the Reagan administration’s response to the epidemic.
“David gave his time, energy and money to building a new political reality in America — having the foresight and dedication to see it through even in the most difficult of times,” Annise Parker, president and CEO of the LGBTQ+ Victory Fund, which aims to elect LGBTQ people to public office, said in a statement. “His legacy is the thousands of out LGBTQ+ people who now serve in elected and appointed positions all across the nation — and the tens of thousands more to come.”
Many current LGBTQ public officials saluted Mixner following the news of his death, with Rep. Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y., calling Mixner “one of the greatest LGBTQ Civil Rights leaders of his generation.”
“He leaves behind a fundamentally fairer world for LGBTQ Americans than the one he knew for most of his life,” Torres said in a statement. “David Mixner was a moral giant on whose shoulders we forever stand.”
New York state Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal called Mixner a “civil rights hero whose efforts improved the lives of millions of LGBTQ Americans.”
“There are countless LGBTQ elected officials who counted David as a friend and role model, myself included,” Hoylman-Sigal said in a statement posted on X.
White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre honored Mixner during a White House press briefing Tuesday.
""Perhaps most importantly, he was deeply dedicated to mentoring the next generation of LGBTQ+ leaders fighting to create a better world,"" Jean-Pierre, who is the first Black and first openly LGBTQ White House press secretary, said. “Those of us doing this work today, including myself, owe him a debt of gratitude.”
It appears that up until the day he died, Mixner was plugged into national politics. On Sunday, he posted a meme responding to Sen. Katie Britt of Alabama’s GOP response to President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address last week, which drew widespread criticism, even inspiring a “Saturday Night Live” skit. One of his last Facebook posts on Sunday simply stated: “Sleepy Joe, my a--.”

Violet Evelyn Alberts was found dead in her bed on May 27, 2022. Deputies with the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office began investigating her death after they found a broken window in the back of her home, Sheriff Bill Brown said at a news conference Thursday.
A medical examiner determined she died from asphyxiation and the manner was homicide.
During the investigation, deputies learned that Alberts had allegedly been tricked into signing over her home in the wealthy Santa Barbara County neighborhood. They also uncovered that she was the victim of a murder-for-hire scheme.
Brown said that investigators identified a woman named Pauline Macareno, 48, as the ""central figure in the manipulation and deceitful targeting"" of Alberts.
Macareno was ""referred"" to Alberts, who needed additional money after she ""aged out"" of her savings, according to the sheriff. Alberts, who did not have any immediate family in the area, lived in a ""very valuable home,"" Brown said.
It's not clear who referred Macareno to the victim.
In 2020, Macareno allegedly ""capitalized on Alberts' vulnerability"" and engaged in financial elder abuse by forging documents and establishing fraudulent entities to gain control of Alberts' assets, Brown told reporters.
Macareno’s scheme involved her offering Alberts a reverse mortgage that ""ultimately led to the fraudulent acquisition of her property,"" he said.
Brown declined to go into detail on the motivation behind the murder, but said that ""in the eyes of Pauline Macareno, Ms. Alberts was living too long.""
Macareno was arrested in June 2022 and charged with elder abuse, fraud and manipulation of legal documents. She was recently sentenced to six years in state prison for fraud related to Alberts’ case. Additional charges are pending, Brown said.
Three other people were arrested this year in connection with the case.
Harry Basmadjian was arrested on Jan. 2, Henry Rostomyan on Feb. 24, and Ricardo MartinDelCampo on Tuesday, the sheriff said.
Rostomyan and MartinDelCampo are accused of doing a ""scouting trip"" at Alberts' home on May 24, 2022, according to the sheriff. It's not clear what Basmadjian's alleged involvement was.
Rostomyan, MartinDelCampo and Basmadjian were arrested on several charges ranging from murder to conspiracy and solicitation of murder, Brown said.
Rostomyan, 33, and MartinDelCampo, 41, are being held in the Santa Barbara County jail without bail. Basmadjian, 58, was being held in federal custody in Los Angeles on an unrelated charge and ""suffered a life-threatening medical emergency"" that left him essentially brain dead, the sheriff said.
Brown declined to say how the male suspects are connected to Macareno.
The sheriff described Alberts as a ""vibrant"" widow who was a ""cherished figure"" in the Montecito community. She moved to the area after her husband, David Alberts, died in 1993.
""Despite her age, she had remained active and engaged,"" the sheriff said. ""And she was known for her warm demeanor and social nature.""
Alberts did not have any family who lived nearby and ""relied on her friendships and connections within the neighborhood,"" he said.
On the night she was killed, she was at her home baking cookies to celebrate her upcoming birthday.
""The ingredients for those cookies were found on the table when on May 27, 2022, the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office responded to a distressing call to check on Violet Alberts' welfare,"" he said.
Her caretaker discovered her body.
Brown said investigators are still seeking additional information in the case.

2024-03-12T20:27:21.874Z,"Recalls have been issued for power adapters, cinnamon, frozen dumplings and more — see the latest list",NBC News,"Product recalls are becoming more common in the U.S.: The number of recalled products reached a five-year high last year, according to a recent report, with around 3,300 recalls reported across the automotive, consumer product, food and drink, medical device and pharmaceutical industries.
Companies generally issue voluntary recalls after they learn that a batch of products has been contaminated or poses a safety risk. For consumers, it can be difficult to keep track of the various recalls issued on popular products — and determine whether any items you bought are affected.
The list below rounds up some of the biggest recalls affecting the public right now.
Yamaha Corporation of America, best known for manufacturing musical instruments, initiated a recall on Thursday of more than 34,000 power adapters because of a risk that the product could shock or electrocute users.
According to an announcement posted by the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the recall applies to Yamaha PA-10 AC power adapters sold between June 2021 and November 2023. A crack between the adapter’s upper and lower cases can expose electrical wiring, though no injuries have been reported.
The adapter is sold on its own and in bundles with certain models of Yamaha analog mixing consoles. The company said consumers should stop using the product and contact Yamaha for a replacement at no cost.
The Food and Drug Administration warned on Wednesday about elevated lead levels in six ground cinnamon products. The list includes La Fiesta, from La Superior SuperMercados; Marcum, from Save A Lot; MK, from SF Supermarket; Swad, from Patel Brothers; Supreme Tradition, from Dollar Tree & Family Dollar; and Eli Chilar, from La Joya Morelense. A Dollar Tree spokesperson said the company had removed Supreme Tradition cinnamon from its stores.
An FDA spokesperson said there was no known link to a recall of lead-tainted cinnamon applesauce pouches last year.
A distributor of Johnsonville meat products is recalling 35,430 pounds of Polish kielbasa turkey sausages after consumers reported finding pieces of rubber in the products.
There have been no reports of health issues.
In a statement on its website, Johnsonville said it had told its retail partners to remove the affected sausages, which have best-by dates of May 2024, from store shelves.
A California manufacturer is recalling nearly 62,000 pounds of frozen chicken soup dumplings sold at Trader Joe’s stores after consumers reported finding hard plastic in the food. The U.S. Agriculture Department said Saturday that the dumplinags may have been contaminated by a permanent marker pen. No illnesses have been reported.
“We voluntarily take action quickly, aggressively investigating potential problems and removing the product from sale if there is any doubt about its safety or quality,” a Trader Joe’s spokesperson told NBC News.
As of Feb. 23, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had received 468 reports of elevated blood lead levels linked to cinnamon applesauce pouches, including 111 confirmed cases. The source of the lead contamination is likely cinnamon from a processor in Ecuador, according to the FDA. The agency said on Feb. 29 that the cinnamon contained lead chromate, a pigment illegally added to spices to increase their weight or enhance their color.
Three brands have recalled the children’s snack: Wanabana pulled its Apple Cinnamon Fruit Puree Pouches from shelves in October, while Weis and the supermarket brand Schnucks followed suit in November.
Chrysler is recalling more than 338,000 Jeep Grand Cherokees because of potentially faulty steering components. Affected models include 2021-2023 Jeep Grand Cherokee LS and 2022-2023 Jeep Grand Cherokees.
In a letter dated Feb. 24 on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website, Chrysler said the steering knuckles and part of the upper control arms — which are supposed to attach together — may in fact separate, which could cause the vehicles to lose control.
Chrysler said it is not aware of any accidents or injuries related to the affected models.
Four types of eye ointment were recalled on Feb. 26 due to concerns that they were manufactured in an unsanitary facility. The products — Equate Lubricant Eye Ointment, Equate Stye Lubricant Eye Ointment, CVS Health Lubricant Eye Ointment and AACE Pharmaceuticals’ Lubricant PM Ointment — were sold nationwide in some Walmart and CVS stores. They have expiration dates ranging from February 2024 to September 2025.
Brassica Pharma Pvt. Ltd., the manufacturer, said in a statement that the potential contamination could lead to eye infections, though no such issues had been reported as of Feb. 16.
The recall is separate from a cluster of bacterial infections linked to contaminated eyedrops, which led to the recall of two brands — EzriCare Artificial Tears and Delsam Pharma’s Artificial Tears — last year. The FDA has also warned people not to use 28 additional eyedrop products after investigators found unsanitary conditions in a facility where the drops were manufactured.
Volkswagen Group, which makes Volkswagen and Audi vehicles, among others, recalled approximately 261,000 vehicles over potentially faulty fuel tank suction pumps. A host of models are affected, including some Audi A3, VW Jetta and VW Golf vehicles with model years 2015 to 2020.
Volkswagen warned last month that due to issues with a suction jet pump seal, “fuel may flow into a separate evaporative (EVAP) emissions system and possibly leak out of the charcoal canister.” A fuel leak can increase fire risks and potentially damage a vehicle or harm its occupants.
The FDA is warning people not to eat dairy products including queso fresco and cotija cheese that were manufactured by Rizo López Foods, a food supplier in Modesto, California. The CDC has linked 26 listeria infections to the products, with cases reported from June 2014 to December 2023. The agencies reopened an investigation in January after new illnesses were reported and a cotija cheese sample tested positive for listeria.
Listeria bacteria can cause serious illness; of the people who got infections, 23 were hospitalized and two died.
To date, more than 115 products made by Rizo López Foods or that contain the manufacturer’s dairy products have been recalled, including taco kits, wraps and meals sold at stores like Albertsons, Costco and Safeway. Most recently, Rico Brand recalled its ready-to-eat enchiladas made with queso fresco on Feb. 22.
Edwin Rizo, CEO of Rizo López Foods, said in a statement that the company is working to find the cause of the problem.
“We regret the impact this has had on our loyal customers who have had to recall their products containing cheese we supplied to them,” Rizo said. “We have always aimed to provide safe, high-quality products.”
Four companies have collectively recalled more than 120,000 biometric gun safes sold by Amazon, Walmart and other major retailers. The safes unlock by scanning a part of the owner’s body such as a fingerprint. But the Consumer Product Safety Commission is aware of 91 reports of unauthorized users opening the safes.
The recall, issued Feb. 22, includes around 60,000 Awesafe safes, more than 33,000 Bulldog safes, nearly 25,000 Machir safes. BBRKIN also recalled 2,200 safes sold on Amazon after a report of a 6-year-old boy opening the product.
CPSC Chair Alex Hoehn-Saric told NBC News that the commission heightened its scrutiny of gun safes after a lawsuit filed in August alleged that a 12-year-old boy died from a firearm obtained from a biometric safe. The CPSC recalled those safes in October.
Bulldog’s vice president, Brandon Rutledge, said in a statement that “the problems have stemmed from people not programming the safes at all, or not programming them properly.”
Dynabook — formerly known as Toshiba — recalled 15.5 million AC laptop adapters on Feb. 21 over concerns about burn and fire risks. Information posted to the CPSC website showed Dynabook had received 679 reports of the affected adapters overheating, catching fire, melting or burning over a period of more than a decade. This included 43 reports of minor burn injuries.
The recalled products were included in the purchase of Toshiba laptops and also sold separately, and have date codes from April 2008 to December 2012.
Two distributors have recalled Neptune’s Fix supplements sold at gas stations and vape or smoke shops, amid reports that the products may cause seizures, loss of consciousness and death. The supplements contain tianeptine, a substance nicknamed “gas station heroin,” and are sold with false claims of improving brain function and helping with anxiety, depression, pain or opioid use disorder. However, tianeptine is not FDA-approved for any use.
A Jan. 11 letter the FDA sent to gas stations, convenience stores and other retailers asked them to stop selling Neptune’s Fix and other tianeptine products. Since then, Neptune Resources, LLC has recalled Neptune’s Fix elixirs and tablets, and Super Chill Products — another distributor — has recalled its elixirs, as well.
Two million handheld fabric steamers were recalled on Feb. 8 following reports of burn injuries from hot water spraying out of the nozzle. The steamers, sold by the brands Steamfast, Vornado and Sharper Image, were sold at Walmart, Bed Bath & Beyond and Amazon. According to the CPSC, Vornado has received 23 reports of burn injuries related to the issue.
DailySale, the seller of a 216-piece magnetic ball set, recalled the product on Feb. 1 due to concerns about children ingesting the high-powered magnets. Another company, Joybuy, recalled a similar product, which was sold at Walmart, at the end of last year.
If children swallow more than one high-powered magnet, they can attract and pinch body tissue, causing internal bleeding, twisting or blockages in the intestines, infection or death. The CPSC recorded 2,400 emergency room visits for magnet ingestions from 2017 through 2021, as well as seven deaths since 2005.
Since the medical technology giant Philips recalled some of its breathing machines in 2021, more than 560 deaths have been reported that may be linked to them. Most recently, the FDA said it received 111 reports of deaths from July 1 to Sept. 30, 2023.
The recalled machines include certain ventilators, as well as BiPAP and CPAP machines used to treat sleep apnea. The foam used in the machines can break down, leading users to breathe chemicals or foam particles into their airways, the FDA said. Philips announced in January that it would not sell new devices for sleep apnea in the U.S. as part of a legal agreement with the FDA and the Department of Justice.
A Philips representative said the company has not found conclusive data linking the devices to the deaths reported.
More than 60 Quaker products have been recalled since Dec. 15 due to potential contamination with salmonella bacteria. The products include certain flavors of Cap’n Crunch and Oatmeal Squares cereals, some Gatorade protein bars and some batches of Quaker Chewy granola bars and Quaker granola cereals. The Quaker Oats Company announced the latest of these recalls, the now-discontinued Quaker Chewy Dipps Llama Rama bars, on Jan. 31.
In January, Toyota warned owners of around 50,000 cars not to drive them due to concerns that the airbags could malfunction and explode. The affected cars include the 2003-2004 Corolla, 2003-2004 Corolla Matrix and model year 2004-2005 RAV4s.
Toyota said in a statement that the age of the vehicles makes it more likely that an airbag deployment could cause serious injury.
The advisory is linked to the Takata airbag recall that has affected tens of millions of vehicles since 2013 and which now comprises the largest recall in automotive history.

2024-03-10T23:40:32.924Z,"Hayao Miyazaki, Studio Ghibli filmmaker, maintains run as only Asian director to win best animated feature",NBC News,"Japanese filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki took home the Academy Award for best animated feature Sunday night for “The Boy and the Heron,” maintaining his spot as the only Asian director to ever triumph in the category.
Miyazaki, 83, a legendary animator known for co-founding Studio Ghibli, won in 2002 for his film “Spirited Away.” He won his first Golden Globe this year for “The Boy and the Heron,” which topped the North American box office when it was released in December and grossed $168 million worldwide.
The film, partly based on Miyazaki’s childhood, follows a 12-year-old boy who lost his mother during World War II. An encounter with a talking heron who tells him his mother is still alive leads him to a world where he can interact with the dead.
“If he hadn’t made this film, he wouldn’t have been able to die a happy man,” Studio Ghibli president and co-founder Toshio Suzuki told The Hollywood Reporter last month.
Fans of Miyazaki’s celebrated works, like “Howl’s Moving Castle” and “My Neighbor Totoro,” fear “The Boy and the Heron” might be his final film as retirement rumors swirl. But he has already “retired” and then come back multiple times, most recently for the seven-year production of “The Boy and the Heron.”
Directors of Asian descent nominated in the best animated feature category have included Domee Shi in 2022 for “Turning Red,” Mamoru Hosoda in 2018 for “Mirai,” Isao Takahata in 2014 for “The Tale of the Princess Kaguya” and Jennifer Yuh Nelson in 2011 for “Kung Fu Panda 2.”

2024-03-12T18:43:54.512Z,Beyoncé reveals the name of her upcoming country album,NBC News,"It’s official. The next installment of Beyoncé’s “Renaissance” is coming, and she’s taking a turn into country music.
On Tuesday, the “Break My Soul” singer announced that her new album will be called “Cowboy Carter.”
She shared a photo on her Instagram story of a brown and silver saddle, which had a sash on it that read, “Cowboy Carter.”
Above the pic, she included a link to her website where fans can buy merch and preorder the album.
During the 2024 Super Bowl, Beyoncé indicated that new music was on the way via her Super Bowl ad for Verizon.
In the ad, as part of an effort to crash Verizon’s service, Beyoncé enacts a variety of publicity stunts, eventually challenging herself to become the first artist to perform in space. Nothing can stop the stable service, though.
In one final effort, Beyoncé says “OK, they ready. Drop the new music.” And then — she did, by releasing new music and long-awaited album news.
Until March 12, the album was referred to as “Renaissance Act II,” since it seemed to be the second installment in Beyoncé’s planned three-part project.
The name “Cowboy Carter” referenced Beyoncé’s married name. Beyoncé’s full name is Beyoncé Knowles-Carter. She married Jay-Z, or Shawn Carter, in 2008.
She’s previously invoked married name in her music career, on the Mrs. Carter Show World Tour in 2013. The start of “Partition” starts with Beyoncé telling a crowd, “Let me hear you say, “Hey, Miss Carter.”
A short video posted to Beyoncé’s Instagram following the Super Bowl gives some details — and a mood board.
In the video, the singer drives a taxi cab through Texas, where she is originally from. Then, a group of people look up at a billboard.
As the camera pans back, the giant ad shows Beyoncé waving in a cowboy hat as a country twang plays in the background, featuring her own vocals.
As she’s pictured driving away, a black screen with writing reveals that “Act II” of her “Renaissance” album drops March 29.
Following the album announcement, two singles were released to stream on new platforms: “Texas Hold ’Em” and “16 Carriages.”
Members of the BeyHive likely weren’t too shocked at Beyoncé’s announcement of a country album.
The singer’s decision to wear a cowboy hat to the Grammy Awards the weekend before the Super Bowl sparked rumors of country music.
Another agreed with the theory and cheered, “Beyoncé wearing a cowboy hat to the Grammys…. ACT TWO ANNOUNCEMENT.”
Though she’s never dropped a fully country album, Beyoncé has dipped her toes into the genre with the release of “Daddy Lessons,” from her 2016 album “Lemonade,” which featured The Chicks.

2024-03-11T18:29:17.178Z,Justice Department investigating door plug blowout on Alaska Airlines flight,NBC News,"The Department of Justice has opened a criminal investigation into the door plug blowout on a Boeing 737 Max 9 plane during an Alaska Airlines flight in January, a person familiar with the matter confirmed to NBC News on Monday.
The news was first reported on Saturday by The Wall Street Journal, saying the DOJ has contacted some passengers who were on the flight to notify them that they are potential victims in the criminal investigation, and that the agency has interviewed pilots and flight attendants who were on the flight.
“In an event like this, it’s normal for the DOJ to be conducting an investigation,” Alaska Airlines said in a statement, adding that it is “fully cooperating and [we] do not believe we are a target of the investigation.”
Both the Justice Department and Boeing said they had no comment on The Wall Street Journal report about the investigation.
On Jan. 5, Flight 1282 departed Portland International Airport for Ontario International Airport in San Bernardino County, California, but turned back after a portion of the plane’s fuselage, known as a “door plug,” detached shortly after takeoff. No one on board was seriously injured and the plane landed safely, but officials cautioned that the situation could have been “much more tragic.”
The incident prompted the temporary grounding of some Boeing 737 Max 9 airplanes. Planes have since returned to service.
An investigation led by the National Transportation Safety Board preliminarily found there were no bolts installed on the door plug.
According to The Wall Street Journal, investigators are looking into whether Boeing complied with a settlement following the 2018 and 2019 737 Max 8 crashes that claimed the lives of 346 people.
The DOJ ultimately placed blame on Boeing in those cases, which in turn blamed two former pilots who determined the amount of training needed to fly the Max planes.
Boeing was ordered to pay $2.5 billion to settle the investigation in 2021, and the government said it would drop a charge of conspiracy to defraud the U.S. after three years if Boeing followed the terms of the settlement.
According to The Wall Street Journal, Boeing could face prosecution on the original count of defrauding the U.S. if, in this new case, the DOJ finds Boeing is at fault of violating the terms of the 2021 settlement. The government could also extend a three-year probationary agreement requiring Boeing to keep the DOJ updated on compliance improvements, the Journal reported.
Following the January Alaska Airlines incident, a number of passengers filed suit against the airline and Boeing.
In the days following the blowout, seven passengers filed a class-action lawsuit against Boeing, alleging the company “delivered the subject 737 MAX-9 to Alaska Airlines, Inc. without properly securing the [door] plug to the airframe,” or because the bolts and seals used to install the panel were defective.
In February, three passengers filed a $1 billion lawsuit against Alaska Airlines and Boeing, accusing the companies of negligence and alleging they ignored warning signs that could have prevented the door plug fiasco.
Jonathan Johnson, a lawyer representing those passengers, said in a Saturday statement, “We are pleased that DOJ has opened this investigation to help determine why this plane was not properly manufactured.”
He added that he hopes “those responsible will be held accountable.”
This week, the Federal Aviation Administration said an audit of Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems — which made the plane at the center of January’s incident — “found multiple instances where the companies allegedly failed to comply with manufacturing quality control requirements.”

2024-03-09T12:00:41.000Z,"Bans on diversity, equity and inclusion may halt Latino progress in higher education",NBC News,"Kelly Solis' 2020 freshman year at University of Texas at Austin, the state's flagship, began with online classes, in forced isolation, because of the pandemic. She moved into a dorm to make connections, but struggled with loneliness and depression.
Her lifeline came when she heard a Latino therapist speak at the annual welcoming program for Latino students, Adelante, organized by Latinx Community Affairs, a student group at the university's Multicultural Engagement Center. The help from the therapist and other academic and personal support she got with regular visits to the center eventually led her to drop thoughts of transferring to a school in her hometown of Houston.
“I had an instant support system from peers and mentors,” Solis, now a graduating senior, told NBC News. She said staff members would send her information on scholarships and other resources. “If they saw fliers with opportunities, they would pass it my way.""
It was crushing, then, when the university shuttered the Multicultural Engagement Center and defunded Latinx Community Affairs, which organizes Latino-focused programs including Adelante to keep students at the university and guide them to graduation and professional life, Solis said. Other groups at the center suffered the same fate.
Texas has energetically climbed aboard the conservative and right-wing campaign to eliminate public, corporate and nonprofit diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs. Its anti-DEI law, and laws and policies like it in other states, are wiping away tools like those that Solis tapped.
Latino enrollment in higher education institutions has been growing with the Hispanic population, and Latinos have made substantial strides in earning college degrees. But the elimination of DEI programs is occurring as Latinos' degree-earning is still failing to keep pace with that of white students.
The share of white Americans 25 and older with a bachelor’s degrees or more, 41.8%, was twice that of Hispanics, 20.9%, in 2022, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
Antonio Flores, president of the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities, said about the DEI bans that the “elephant in the room is racism.” The elimination of programs and events such as the closing of UT Austin's Multicultural Engagement Center or the Latinx Graduation are “politically motivated and ideologically driven,” he said.
“Demographically, the nation is going in the other direction,” Flores said, alluding to the growing diversification in the country. “Maybe what is undergirding all of this is the unfounded fear that some of the folks who have been historically monopolizing the positions of power are fearful they are going to lose that. They need to make room for the populations that are emerging.”
Flores noted that the Department of Labor has projected that in the decade ending in 2030, three of every four workers — 78% — joining the American labor force will be Hispanic.
“The nation as a whole is increasingly dependent on populations like Latinos and Latinas, and we need to increase our educational attainment, especially in higher education, so we can be better prepared as the backbone of America’s labor force, to sustain the prosperity of the nation. That’s what they don’t get. This is not about particular communities, it’s about the well being of the nation, the state,” Flores said.
A New York Times investigation examined thousands of emails and texts from conservative institutions spearheading the movement against DEI policies and found ""unvarnished views on race, sexuality and gender roles,"" including comments like ""the core of what we oppose is anti-discrimination.""
In Texas, Hispanics are the largest population, and the state’s growth is attributable to increases in the numbers of Hispanic, Black, Asian American and other nonwhite people.
But UT Austin, Texas’ flagship, only enrolled enough Hispanic undergraduates to qualify as a Hispanic Serving Institution, or HSI, in 2021, 138 years after it was founded. To be an HSI, at least 25% of the full-time student population is Latino. Over 40% of Texans are Hispanic, slightly outnumbering non-Latino whites.
Other flagships have also done poorly in enrolling Latino students. In Texas, 39.4% of white people had a bachelor’s degree or higher compared to 16.1% of Hispanics, a slightly larger gap than in 2007, according to the Texas Demographic Center.
Excelencia in Education, which began tracking HSIs 20 years ago, initially focused on improving Latino enrollment. But as outreach to Latinos improved and enrollment rose, Excelencia shifted to training universities in getting more degrees in Latinos’ hands.
Deborah Santiago, co-founder and CEO of Excelencia in Education, said the organization grants its Seal of Excelencia to institutions committed to serving Latino students and accelerating their degree-earning, which her group calls “intentionality.” It gave the seal in 2020 to UT Austin, where the six-year graduation rate for Hispanics earning bachelor’s degrees reached 82% in 2022.
When the seal was awarded, UT Austin’s President Jay Hartzell stated that UT Austin “is deeply committed to supporting the academic success of Latino students in higher education and making this a more welcoming and inclusive campus for all students.”
He listed in the statement UT’s efforts to earn the seal, including developing mentorlike relationships with Latino students, gathering faculty, staff and alumni to engage Latino students in their community, and developing specific programs to attract and support students in disciplines across campus.
Mentioning and encouraging those initiatives today would bring a rain of fire with possible penalty from the state and backlash from conservatives on the lookout for breaches of the new state law.
“No one wants to be the first institution sued. They [universities] are defaulting by taking out anything that is specific and I do think that is a challenge to intentionality and serving students,” Santiago said.
“We thought the country was in a good place in terms of access and acknowledging Latino growth in the college age population and strategies to do outreach and engagement. But now we have to worry about access again,” she said.
A university that qualifies as an HSI is eligible for additional federal money that is unaffected by state laws and is not confined to be spent only on Latino students. There are 571 HSIs in 28 states and Puerto Rico, and they enroll 62% of Latinos in college, according to Excelencia in Education analysis.
The anti-DEI law didn’t stop Texas officials from pouring $12 million of state and UT System funds into the establishment of the Civitas Institute, a new college pushed by conservative lawmakers and donors who said it brought “intellectual diversity” to UT. Civitas is promoted as a think tank focused on individual liberty and limited government, but Texas' Republican Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick once tweeted that the purpose of the institute, which was originally called Liberty Institute, was to stop critical race theory, a discipline focused on studying systemic and institutional racism but often used as a catch-all term for race and ethnicity studies.
NBC News reached out to the governor’s office, UT at Austin and UT System by phone and email and did not receive responses.
Texas A&M in College Station, Texas, Texas Tech in Lubbock and others also shut down DEI offices to comply with Texas’ law. In other parts of the country, the University of Tennessee in Knoxville has renamed its DEI office because of the state’s new anti-DEI law, the Daily Beacon reported. Students and universities in Utah are bracing for the impact of their recently signed law.
The University of Florida announced last Friday it had eliminated DEI positions, closed the Office of Chief Diversity Officer and ended DEI-focused contracts with vendors.
At UT Austin, Solis had found so much support she decided to give back to the university. She became co-director of the Latinx Community Affairs group and organized the 2023 Adelante to welcome the latest group of Longhorn Latinos.
Now, she and other worry about what comes next.
The Latino Community Affairs group was left to scramble to avoid canceling its annual Latinx Graduation, which celebrates about 300 Latinos and their families in English and Spanish.
Andrea Morquecho, a first-generation University of Texas at Austin student, was looking forward to the event and having family from Mexico attend. Last year she went with her friend's parents, who don't speak English.
“Their excitement during this ceremony was incomparable to the other graduation, because it was in Spanish,” Morquecho said. “I looked forward to hearing the words of encouragement from the Latino guest speakers who understand the obstacles many of us overcame.”
Texas Exes, UT’s former students association, has announced it would host the Latinx Graduation and other cultural graduations, the Daily Texan reported.
For the past two spring semesters, Liany Serrano, another Latino  Community Affairs leader, has organized the Latinx Leadership Institute that brings in guest speakers from technology, politics, health care and other industries for networking and workshops.
“We provided ways for [Latino students] to meet people that could give them jobs after they graduate,"" she said, ""but now we don’t have funding to put on LLI. They’re going to miss making those connections.""

2024-03-11T20:09:36.789Z,"Kirk Cousins to Atlanta, Saquon Barkley to Philadelphia among NFL's blockbuster signings",NBC News,"Kirk Cousins and Saquon Barkley, two of pro football's best-known players at their positions, flew the coop Monday for the Atlanta Falcons and the Philadelphia Eagles, respectively, jolting the normally staid NFL offseason.
Cousins, the fifth-leading passer of all active quarterbacks, has left the Minnesota Vikings and agreed to a four-year deal with the Falcons, said his agent, Mike McCartney.
Cousins, 35, had spent six seasons in Minnesota, following six campaigns with the franchise now known as the Washington Commanders.
The NFL's 2024 schedule hasn’t been announced, but each team knows whom they'll be playing this fall. The Falcons, by coincidence, are set to visit the Vikings this season.
Barkley, a three-time 1,000-yard rusher with the New York Giants, wrote on X: ""Thank you to everyone who has shown me love and support over the past 6 years… forever grateful! Excited for the next chapter.""
His next post was simply of two eagle heads.
Barkley, 27, was the No. 2 overall pick of the 2018 NFL draft out of Penn State.
He rushed for a single-season career high of 1,312 yards on 4.4 yards per carry in 2022, helping the Giants to a 9-7-1 mark and an unexpected playoff appearance.
Barkley and New York both slumped this past season, as he ran for 962 yards and a 3.9 average, while the Giants fell to 6-11. But he was still a valuable prize on the free agent market, particularly down the road in Philadelphia, where he quickly filled a need.
Barkley's announcement came hours after the Eagles lost their top rusher as Philadelphia native D’Andre Swift bolted for the Chicago Bears.
As rivals in the NFC East, the Eagles and the Giants will meet twice this season.
Running back Tony Pollard, who rushed for at least 1,000 yards the past two seasons for the Dallas Cowboys, came to terms with the Tennessee Titans, NBC affiliate KPRC of Houston reported Monday.
And another running back on the move appeared to be Josh Jacobs of the Las Vegas Raiders, who is set to ditch the desert in favor of the frozen tundra of Green Bay, the NFL Network reported. Jacobs, 26, rushed for 805 yards last season after having led the NFL with 1,653 in 2022.
The move to Green Bay is likely to lead to the release of Aaron Jones, whose last game as a Packer was a spectacular 108-yard, 18-carry game against the San Francisco 49ers in a playoff loss on Jan. 20.
Super Bowl-winning quarterback Russell Wilson, let go after two turbulent seasons with the Denver Broncos, announced Sunday that he's headed to Pittsburgh to play his 13th NFL season with the Steelers.
It has been just four weeks since the Kansas City Chiefs defeated San Francisco, 25-22, in Las Vegas to capture their second consecutive Super Bowl title and their third championship in five years.

2024-03-13T00:05:38.129Z,Sean 'Diddy' Combs accused of sexually assaulting a 16-year-old in the early 1990s,NBC News,"Sean “Diddy” Combs is being accused of sexual assault by another woman, who alleged in a lawsuit that the music mogul and the R&B singer Aaron Hall assaulted her and her friend at Hall’s apartment in 1990 or 1991.
The alleged assault happened following an event at the offices of MCA Records, according to a lawsuit filed in November in New York Supreme Court, one day before the expiration of the New York Adult Survivors Act, which allows adult sexual assault survivors one year to sue regardless of when the original statute of limitations expired. An amended suit was filed March 12.
After the initial suit was filed, a spokesperson for Combs told NBC News: “The claims involving alleged misconduct against Mr. Combs from over 30 years ago and filed at the last minute are all completely denied and rejected by him. He recognizes this as a money grab. Because of Mr. Combs’ fame and success, he is an easy target for accusers who will falsify the truth, without conscience or consequence, for financial benefit. The New York Legislature surely did not intend or expect the Adult Survivors Act to be exploited for improper purposes. The public should be skeptical and not rush to accept these unsubstantiated allegations.”
Hall could not immediately be reached for comment.
The woman, identified in the complaint as Liza Gardner, said she and a friend met Combs and Hall, who was a member of the R&B group Guy, at the record label’s offices for an event MCA was hosting. The friend is not named as a plaintiff in the lawsuit.
The suit alleges that Combs and Hall were “very flirtatious and handsy with Liza Gardner and her friend” and offered them drinks throughout the event. Toward the end of the night, Combs and Hall invited Gardner and her friend back to Hall’s apartment for an after-party, according to the lawsuit.
“While at Hall’s apartment, Liza Gardner was offered more drinks and was coerced into having sex with Combs,” the suit says. “After Combs finished doing his business, Liza Gardner laid in bed, shocked and traumatized.”
While she was trying to get dressed, Hall allegedly “barged into the room, pinned her down, and forced Liza Gardner to have sex with him,” the suit says.
Following the alleged assaults, she got dressed and ran from the home, according to the lawsuit.
The lawsuit accuses both men of sexually assaulting Gardner’s friend that same evening at Hall’s home.
“Upon information and belief, when Combs finished with Liza Gardner, he and Hall switched, and they commenced assaulting Liza Gardner’s friend,” the lawsuit alleges.
Days later, Combs went to the home where Gardner and her friend were staying, became “irate” and allegedly assaulted and choked Gardner until she passed out, according to the suit. It says that Combs was allegedly looking for the friend because he feared she would tell the “girl he was with at the time.”
An amended complaint, filed by Gardner on Tuesday and obtained exclusively by NBC News, said she was 16 at the time and too young to consume alcohol legally or consent to sex. It says that Gardner had been invited to New York and introduced to Combs by close friends who were members of the group Jodeci. The new filing indicates that Gardner was wearing a black skirt with a button-up blouse.
Representatives and attorneys for Combs did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the amended complaint.
In addition to Combs and Hall, the lawsuit names MCA Music Entertainment Group and Geffen Records as defendants. NBC News reached out to Universal Music Group, the owner of Geffen and now defunct MCA. A spokesperson there did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
When reached for comment after the initial suit was filed, Tyrone Blackburn, an attorney for Gardner, said his client is in the “process of securing her medical documents, and witness statements.”
Combs and some of his companies have been at the center of sexual abuse lawsuits in the past week. Another accuser, Joie Dickerson-Neal, filed a separate lawsuit Thursday alleging that Combs drugged her and sexually assaulted her in 1991 while she was a college student at Syracuse University. Dickerson-Neal, who said she “reluctantly” had dinner with Combs at a New York City restaurant and then accompanied him as he ran errands, also accused Combs of recording the assault without her knowledge and sharing that video with other people.
""I am so thankful for the bravery of the other women that came forward, the Adult Survivors Act which opened up the filing window to seek justice, and the unwavering support from my attorneys,"" Dickerson-Neal said in a statement Friday. ""For 32 years, the only people I have been able to confide in were my close friends and therapists. I’m feeling as if the darkness has been lifted and I can freely move forward in achieving my full potential.”
A spokesperson for Combs denied the allegations, saying the claims are “not credible” and “this is purely a money grab.”
“This last-minute lawsuit is an example of how a well-intentioned law can be turned on its head,” a spokesperson for Combs said. “Ms. Dickerson’s 32-year-old story is made up and not credible. Mr. Combs never assaulted her, and she implicates companies that did not exist. This is purely a money grab and nothing more.”
During the time span mentioned in the lawsuit, when Dickerson-Neal alleges a sexual assault took place, Combs worked for Uptown Records and had not yet formed his companies.
Dickerson-Neal said she decided to file a lawsuit after Combs’ former girlfriend, singer and actor Cassie, filed a federal lawsuit alleging he raped, sex-trafficked and abused her. Cassie’s lawsuit was settled one day later for an undisclosed amount of money.
Cassie, whose full name is Casandra Ventura, said she “decided to resolve this matter amicably on terms that I have some level of control.” Ben Brafman, a lawyer for Combs, said the mogul’s decision to settle was “in no way an admission of wrongdoing.”
“Mr. Combs’ decision to settle the lawsuit does not in any way undermine his flat-out denial of the claims,” Brafman said.
Douglas Wigdor, an attorney for Cassie, has not directly commented on Jane Doe or Dickerson-Neal’s lawsuits but said Friday, “In my experience handling sexual assault cases it is not uncommon for other victims to come forward once the first brave survivor makes public allegations concerning a high-profile perpetrator.”
Another lawsuit was filed Tuesday accusing Harve Pierre, the ex-president of Bad Boy Entertainment and Bad Boy Records, of sexually assaulting an unnamed former assistant. Combs’ companies were also named in the lawsuit on one count of gender-motivated violence and two counts of negligence.
Pierre did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the allegations. A spokesperson for Bad Boy Entertainment said Wednesday that the company was aware of the lawsuit and is “now investigating the allegations.”

2024-03-08T20:12:24.618Z,U.S. Army sergeant accused of exchanging sensitive military information with co-conspirator in Hong Kong,NBC News,"A U.S. Army sergeant and intelligence analyst was arrested Thursday on six charges related to a conspiracy in which he is accused of trading military secrets with a co-conspirator in Hong Kong in exchange for cash, officials said.
Korbein Schultz was arrested at Fort Campbell, Tennessee, following an indictment by a federal grand jury, the Justice Department said.
Schultz was charged with conspiracy to obtain and disclose national defense information, exporting technical data related to defense articles without a license, conspiracy to export defense articles without a license and bribery of a public official, said Henry Leventis, the U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee.
The U.S. attorney's office said Schultz worked with a co-conspirator based in Hong Kong who said he worked for a ""geopolitical consulting firm based overseas"" to ""disclose documents, writings, plans, maps, notes, and photographs relating to national defense as well as information relating to national defense which Schultz had reason to believe could be used to injure the United States or used to the advantage of a foreign nation.""
In exchange for his work, the co-conspirator paid Schultz about $42,000 over 14 payments, according to the prosecutor's office.
Schultz, who prosecutors said had a ""Top Secret security clearance,"" was recruited by the co-conspirator, who often asked Schultz for sensitive materials pertaining to the U.S. and its military, the U.S. attorney’s office alleged.
Specifically, the co-conspirator tasked Schultz with providing classified information about weapons systems and information regarding a U.S. response should China engage in a military attack against Taiwan — materials he had access to because of his security clearance, the prosecutor's office said.
The information Schultz provided included ""documents related to the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), information on hypersonic equipment, studies on the future development of U.S. military forces, studies on major countries such as the People’s Republic of China, and summaries of military drills and operations,"" the office said.
In addition, over the course of the nearly two-year alleged conspiracy, Schultz shared three documents that violated the Arms Export Control Act, including Air Force Tactics Techniques and Procedures manuals for the HH-60W helicopter, F22-A fighter aircraft and intercontinental ballistic missiles, prosecutors said.
Schultz is scheduled to make his first appearance in a central Tennessee court Friday, Leventis said.
""Protecting national defense information is absolutely critical to our country’s safety and security,” Leventis said. ""The unauthorized sale of such information violates our national security laws, compromises our safety, and cannot be tolerated.""
It was not immediately clear whether an attorney had been assigned to represent Schultz. A representative at the public defender's office in the Middle District of Tennessee said that she was unsure whether Schultz was represented by someone in the office and that it typically does not give out information about defendants.
In a statement Friday, Lt. Col. Tony Hoefler, a spokesperson for Fort Campbell, confirmed Schultz's current assignment with the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) and said they ""have and will continue to cooperate with the US Attorney's Office"" in the case.
Schultz's arrest follows several recent developments regarding military secrets.
A member of the Air Force was arrested Saturday and charged with illegally sending secret information about Russia’s war in Ukraine through a foreign dating website to a woman claiming to be in Ukraine.
And Monday, Massachusetts Air National Guard member Jack Teixeira pleaded guilty to leaking classified military documents about the war in Ukraine on Discord.
CORRECTION (March 8, 2024, 2:23 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated when the investigation started. The alleged conspiracy started in June 2022, not the investigation.

2024-03-13T22:55:47.026Z,Christie Brinkley says she's received treatment for 'early' skin cancer diagnosis,NBC News,"Christie Brinkley is warning her followers to be “diligent with your sun protection” after she was diagnosed with skin cancer.
The model, 70, announced her diagnosis Wednesday on Instagram, accompanied by graphic images of a gaping wound on her temple, which she also photographed stitched up and bandaged.
“The good news for me is we caught the basal cell Carcinoma early. And I had great Doctors that removed the cancer and stitched me up to perfection like an haute couture Dior,” Brinkley wrote in her caption.
Basal cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer, per the Mayo Clinic. It begins in basal cells, a type of cell found in the skin. Typically, basal cell carcinoma takes form as a bump on the skin and is often caused by exposure to sunlight.
In her post, Brinkley said her type of cancer “can be avoided” and shared a message about the importance of sun protection, something she said she “got serious” about “a bit late.”
“Now for this ole mermaid/gardener, I’ll be slathering on my SPF 30, reapplying as needed, wearing long sleeves and a wide brim hat. And doing regular total body check ups..that is a MUST !” Brinkley wrote.
Brinkley said she was “lucky” a doctor found the basal cell carcinoma while she accompanied one of her children to their appointment.
“At the VERY end I asked if he could just look at a little tiny dot I could feel as I applied my foundation. He took a look and knew immediately it needed a biopsy! He did it then and there!” she said.
She concluded her post by thanking her doctors at New York’s Laser & Skin Surgery Center.
Brinkley has been open about embracing aging and is quick to respond to negative comments about her appearance.
In June 2023, she took to Instagram to call out the “Wrinkle Brigade.” She clarified that the term refers to “people that scan celebrities’ pages, hoping to find some cellulite, wrinkles, or anything that they can point to to critique.”
“It must be (some) form of compensation for something they are lacking,” Brinkley said. “But when those people appear, there are others who pop up with messages so kind and valuable. Those are the comments that restore my faith and make my heart sing!”

2024-03-12T15:43:18.006Z,New Jersey school district apologizes for 'inflammatory' Ramadan note accusing Israel of genocide,NBC News,"A New Jersey school district apologized after an assistant high school principal shared a flyer with antisemitic undertones to inform staff members about Ramadan, the holy month of fasting, prayer and reflection for the Muslim community.
The flyer was sent Monday, the start of Ramadan, by the assistant principal of Columbia High School in Maplewood. The notice begins innocuously, expounding upon the meaning of Ramadan and terms to know, as well as what the holiday means for schools.
A paragraph at the bottom, though, accuses the U.S. of “co-conspiring” with Israel to prevent “Muslim Palestinians from partaking in Ramadan, as the Israeli Zionist occupation enacts a genocide against them.”
The letter got shared widely.
Backlash was swift, with the superintendent putting out a written apology hours later as some parents demanded the state take over the beleaguered school district.
In the letter to families, staff members and the community, South Orange & Maplewood acting Superintendent Kevin Gilbert said he was made aware of the “inflammatory document” Monday afternoon.
“The document was not reviewed or approved by any district office or personnel, and while the intention of sharing the document was to provide a resource, serious content was overlooked,” Gilbert wrote. “This resource contained language that, at any time, would be inflammatory but, particularly now, is deeply problematic and inappropriate for our schools.
“Personally, I am disappointed, angered and saddened by the communication that occurred,” Gilbert continued. “The language in the document does not reflect what we believe creates a community that values inclusivity and belonging.”
Gilbert said the school district would work to identify a more appropriate resource around Ramadan. He also said the assistant principal didn’t agree with the sentiment at the bottom of the flyer but merely overlooked it and understands that the messaging was inappropriate. Moving forward, Gilbert said, all resources would be reviewed before they are shared with the wider school community “to ensure they meet our standards for respect, inclusivity and belonging.”
Gilbert said the district is aware the incident damaged its inclusion efforts and reiterated his commitment to “working with any and all groups and individuals who want to help us be the best district we can be.”
Earlier in the day, the school’s principal had surrendered to Essex County prosecutors on an assault charge, accused of attacking a student.
On that issue, Gilbert said in a statement Tuesday: “I am deeply saddened by the news of charges against the Columbia High School Principal, the latest in a series of unexpected events that have happened in our district during this school year. No matter what our feelings may be at this time, our focus must be on meeting the needs of Columbia High School students, their families and staff.”
“I am working with my administration colleagues to make sure we continue to fulfill our obligations to the people we service,” he pledged.

2024-03-12T15:10:55.341Z,"Support for same-sex marriage and LGBTQ protections dipped in 2023, survey shows",NBC News,"The share of U.S. adults who support same-sex marriage and laws that protect LGBTQ people from discrimination has dipped in the last year, a survey has found.
After steadily increasing over the last decade, support for same-sex marriage dipped to 67% in 2023 from a record high of 69% the year before, according to the survey of more than 22,000 U.S. adults, which was conducted by the nonpartisan Public Religion Research Institute, or PRRI, and reported a margin of sampling error of 0.82%. More than three-quarters of those surveyed (76%) favored laws that protect LGBTQ people from discrimination in housing, employment and public accommodation, a decline from a record high of 80% in 2022.
Melissa Deckman, PRRI’s chief executive, noted that while support for same-sex marriage and nondiscrimination protections for LGBTQ people remains significantly higher than it was a decade ago, the year-over-year declines surprised researchers.
“You can’t really take a look at this report and not note some declines, especially among Republicans,” Deckman told NBC News in an interview. “Party polarization is really driving the national averages down.”
Democrats are much more likely than Republicans to support same-sex marriage, the survey found. Support among Democrats remained steady year-over-year at 82% in 2023, while Republican support dipped to 47% from 49% during that time period. Support for laws that prohibit discrimination against LGBTQ people took an even steeper hit among Republicans, dropping to 59% last year from 66% in 2022, while Democratic support remained steady at 89% in 2023.
A decline in support for same-sex marriage also appears to be driven by younger adults, or those ages 18-29, the survey found. Although a greater share of younger adults support same-sex marriage compared with older ones — and a greater share of younger adults identify as LGBTQ —  the share of young adults who supported same-sex marriage declined to 71% last year from 74% in 2022 and a record high of 79% in 2018.
“There’s been more of an emphasis on this idea that LGBTQ rights have gone too far in America — they’re hearing that in churches that are conservative, they’re seeing on social media that’s conservative, on far-right news sources that are conservative,” Deckman said, referring to those in the 18-29 age group. “And that message is resonating.”
Deckman noted that the drive in declining support from younger adults was not indicative of an increasing share of younger adults identifying as Republicans.
Same-sex marriage was legalized across the U.S. in 2015 after a landmark Supreme Court ruling, Obergefell v. Hodges, determined that state bans against such unions were unconstitutional. Fears that the Supreme Court might overturn same-sex marriage rights have festered after Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022.
In December 2022, President Joe Biden signed the Respect for Marriage Act, which enshrined marriage rights for same-sex couples into federal law. However, that has not stopped state lawmakers from trying to chip away at the right. Just last month, Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee signed a law that will allow public officials in the state to refuse to perform marriages if doing so goes against their beliefs.
PRRI’s survey found that support for same-sex marriage is lower among respondents living in states where same-sex marriage would not be legal if Obergefell v. Hodges were overturned, 64%, compared with 72% in states where the unions would still be legal.
Republican state lawmakers across the country have pushed record numbers of anti-LGBTQ laws in legislatures in recent years. Last year, legislators introduced more than 500 such measures across the country, including 75 that became law, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. Many of the enacted laws restrict access to gender-affirming care for trans minors and limit trans athletes’ ability to participate on sports teams that correspond with their gender identities.
So far this year, conservative lawmakers have introduced more than 475 bills targeting the LGBTQ community, the ACLU found. The measures include those that would restrict bathroom use for transgender people and bar trans people from changing their sexes on their driver’s licenses.

Scott Varner, the spokesperson for Franklin County Children Services, said the child’s parents reported him missing Sunday. It’s believed he spent the night at the location, police told NBC affiliate WCMH of Columbus.
Varner said by email, ""This was a runaway situation.""
There were no reports the boy was harmed, the station said.
Police spokesperson Jennifer Watson said by email Monday, “The child’s parents are happy that he is safe and that he will be returning home shortly.”
Staff members at the store, which is on the east side of Columbus, on the border with Reynoldsburg, ""immediately contacted law enforcement upon finding this child and cared for him until authorities arrived,"" Target said in a statement.
""The well-being of our guests is our top priority,"" it said.
Columbus police logged the store's call about 6:15 a.m., Watson said.
Officers unsuccessfully searched the area, which includes a number of retailers, for the boy's parents before they handed him off to Franklin County Children Services, she said.
He was reunited with his parents at a children's services facility Monday afternoon, Varner said.

2024-03-08T18:20:46.706Z,"No evidence that U.S. covered up existence of UFOs, Pentagon report says",NBC News,"No credible evidence exists that U.S. authorities covered up extraterrestrial life, in the form of unidentified flying objects, even if some Americans firmly believe in UFOs, a Pentagon report said Friday.
The report offered a number of explanations of what has led to more than 40% of Americans thinking that life forms from another galaxy have visited earth.
""Investigative efforts determined that most sightings were the result of misidentification of ordinary objects and phenomena,"" according to the conclusion of a 63-page report on ""unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP).""
""Although many UAP reports remain unsolved, AARO (All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office) assesses that if additional, quality data were available, most of these cases also could be identified and resolved as ordinary objects or phenomena.""
Maj. Gen. Patrick S. Ryder, a defense department spokesperson, insisted there's ""no verifiable evidence for claims that the U.S. government and private companies have access to or have been reverse-engineering extraterrestrial technology.""
""Also, AARO has found no evidence that any U.S. government investigation, academic-sponsored research, or official review panel has confirmed that any sighting of a UAP represented extraterrestrial technology,"" he added. ""All investigative efforts, at all levels of classification, concluded that most sightings were ordinary objects and phenomena and the result of misidentification.""
But Luis Elizondo, former head of the Pentagon’s Advanced Aerospace Threat ID Program, took issue with Friday's report, especially its strident language rejecting all possible UAP evidence.
""The government has documentation, stacks upon stacks, of UAP going back decades, interfering with our critical military  technologies,"" Elizondo said.
""To try to put the cat back into the bag the way that they did, it’s extremely disingenuous and it’s against the interest of the American people.""
The report listed several satellite and other data-gathering craft developed, usually in secret, by the government and private industry that could have easily been identified as UFOs by the general public.
""The below examples represent a sample of the unclassified and declassified authentic national security programs that AARO assesses probably were associated with erroneous UAP reporting,"" it said of crafts built by companies such as Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman.
The report suggested that Americans' belief in UFOs is unlikely to change.
""Aside from hoaxes and forgeries, misinformation and disinformation is more prevalent and easier to disseminate now than ever before, especially with today’s advanced photo, video, and computer generated imagery tools,"" the report said. ""Internet search and content recommendation algorithms serve to reinforce individuals’ preconceptions and confirmation biases just as much as to help educate and inform.""
Friday's report seemed to contradict at least some elements of a House Oversight subcommittee hearing, in July last year, that put UAPs firmly into the public consciousness.
David Grusch, a former U.S. intelligence official, told the panel he knows of “multiple colleagues” who were injured by UAPs and that he's  interviewed individuals who have recovered “nonhuman biologics” from crashed UAPs.
He declined to elaborate and the Pentagon, at that time, categorically denied Grusch's claims.

2024-03-13T09:27:18.419Z,Virginia wildlife center staff pretend to be a fox to care for a rescued newborn,NBC News,"A wildlife center has developed a way of stopping an abandoned newborn red fox from becoming too used to humans: By feeding it wearing a fox mask.
The Richmond Wildlife Center in Richmond, Virginia, shared a video of the center's founder, Melissa Stanley, feeding milk to the tiny female kit — the term for a juvenile fox — while wearing the mask in an attempt to prevent imprinting, where animals form a strong bond shortly after birth with the first other animal it receives care from.
""It’s important to make sure that the orphans that are raised in captivity do not become imprinted upon or habituated to humans,"" the center said in a Facebook post Tuesday.
""To prevent that, we minimize human sounds, create visual barriers, reduce handling, reduce multiple transfers amongst different facilities, and wear masks for the species,"" the update said.
The center added that it was able to find other fox kits the same age and weight as the rescued fox.
The tiny fox, weighing just 80 grams (2.8 oz), was discovered by Richmond SPCA and handed over to the center on Feb. 29. Rescuers at first thought it was a cat, but soon realized it was a neonatal fox kit, with its eyes still shut and with its teeth yet to appear.
The center's mask video echoed a scheme from a wildlife sanctuary in China in 2022, where workers dressed in panda outfits smeared with bear faeces and urine in an attempt to erase the memory of human contact from the captive pandas.
The center in Virginia used the incident to raise awareness of the dangers of rabies.
The people who found the fox handled it with bare hands, and the center warned that this put both the finder and the animal in danger.
Proper gloves must be worn to handle any stricken mammal found in the wild, including dogs and cats, to prevent the need for it to be killed and sent for rabies testing, it said.
The center added that, contrary to popular opinion, rabies does not always occur in animals acting aggressively.
The City of Richmond has reported two cases of rabies in domestic cats in the last five years, the center said, but none in foxes. There were 131 cases in cats across Virginia in the same timeframe, and 185 cases in foxes, the center said.
""While the risk of transmission of rabies from this newborn fox kit is minimal given statistics on foxes in the city of Richmond, it has no teeth, and was dehydrated with reduced saliva in its mouth, the risk is not zero,"" the center said in a Facebook post on March 1.
The center said it would attempt to reunited the kit with its mother.

2024-03-12T16:00:46.879Z,Flashy N.Y. bishop robbed during livestreamed service found guilty of wire fraud and attempted extortion,NBC News,"A Brooklyn preacher known for his flashy lifestyle and who boasted of his friendship with New York City’s mayor was found guilty in federal court Monday of wire fraud, attempted extortion and lying to the FBI.
Lamor Miller-Whitehead, 47, was found guilty of five counts after a trial in federal court in Manhattan that began late last month. Prosecutors had argued that the preacher exaggerated his ties to Mayor Eric Adams and let greed overtake him as he looted a parishioner’s retirement savings and tried to extort a businessman to fuel his lavish lifestyle.
He also was accused of lying to FBI agents by denying he had a second cellphone.
An attorney for Miller-Whitehead, Dawn Florio, said they are appealing the verdict. She had told jurors during the trial that evidence against her client didn’t support the charges.
Miller-Whitehead made headlines in July when armed bandits crashed his church service and robbed him of $1 million in jewelry.
The preacher embraced his flashy lifestyle. He was known for driving around in a Rolls Royce and records show he lived in a $1.6 million home in Paramus, New Jersey. He also owned apartment buildings in Hartford, Connecticut.
Prosecutors alleged Miller-Whitehead bilked a parishioner out of $90,000 in retirement savings by falsely promising he would find her a home and invest the rest in his real estate business. Prosecutors say he instead spent the money on luxury goods and clothing.
He also was accused of trying to convince a businessman to lend him $500,000 and give him a stake in real estate deals by claiming his ties to city officials could earn favorable treatment for the businessman’s interests.
Adams grew close to Miller-Whitehead while serving as Brooklyn’s borough president. Adams, a former police captain, has since said he spent decades enforcing the law and expects everyone to follow it.
Sentencing for Miller-Whitehead is scheduled for July 1.

The slick sheen was spotted about 1 1/2 miles off Huntington Beach in Orange County, about 40 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles, and appeared to be about 2 1/2 miles long, the U.S. Coast  Guard said.
The possible oil spill was first reported about 6:50 p.m. Thursday, the Coast Guard said.
""We are actively monitoring reports of an oil sheen near Huntington Beach,"" Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement. ""We have deployed personnel to evaluate the incident and will continue to coordinate with local, state and federal partners. ""
It wasn't immediately unclear if the slick came from a vessel or leaked from a nearby oil platform.
The sheen is far enough off the beach that swimmers and surfers were still safe, Friday, officials said.
Containment booms and absorbing material have been placed around the slick and appear to have controlled any expansion or movement, USCG Petty Officer Richard Uranga said.
""It really wasn't spreading too much, it wasn't increasing from when it (first) appeared,"" Uranga said.
Beta Operating Company runs oil platforms off the coast of nearby Long Beach. But parent company Amplify Energy said it does not believe this slick is linked to its operations.
""Amplify Energy Corp. is aware of reports of an oil sheen off the coast of Huntington Beach, California. At this time, we have no indication that this sheen is related to our operations,"" the Houston-based company said in a statement.

The 66-year-old German told the ""Musings on Golf"" that he was playing the increasingly popular racket sport ""to stay fit"" in February when he heard a ""pop.""
“I play all sorts of sports to stay fit and this was part of my fitness regime,” Langer said on the podcast which dropped on Tuesday. “I was playing pickleball here in  Woodfield (Florida) where I live and have a lot of fun and just somebody was trying to lob me. I did a few steps backward and hit an overhead and as I landed on the ground with my feet, I heard this huge ‘pop,’ very loud, like a gun shot.""
Pickleball has become one of the nation's fastest growing activities  and is particularly popular among senior citizens.
It resembles tennis but is played on a much smaller court, thus minimizing lower body movements and endurance while pushing players to maintain strong hand-eye coordination.
""And I knew right away it was a torn Achilles because I had seen it happen to other people playing basketball and other sports,"" said Langer, who has a record 46 wins on the PGA Tour Champions — formerly known as the Senior PGA Tour.
Langer had earlier announced that this year's Masters, where he donned green jackets in 1985 and 1993, would be his last.
Although he'll miss this year's tournament in that upcoming Augusta competition, he promised to attend the Champions Dinner, a beloved Masters tradition served on Tuesday of tournament week.
""It's one of the highlights of my year, I always look forward to the champions dinner just because of the aura being in the presence of some of the greatest players,"" he said.
""To spend two or three  hours with these guys in a very intimate setting is very unique. Obviously the great food and the good wine and all of that doesn't hurt either.""
Langer said he went under the knife 24 hours after the injury and was rehabbing three days later.
After four weeks of rehabilitation, Langer told the podcast that he's optimistic for a speedy recovery. He ambitiously targeted the  Insperity Invitational, played near Houston May 3-5, for his return to the tour.
""Things are are looking up,"" he said. ""I'm feeling great, I'm making progress. Yesterday was the first time I walked around without crutches, without a scooter, on my own without holding on to anything which was very exciting.""

2024-03-11T04:10:35.856Z,Backcountry skier dies amid icy conditions on New Hampshire’s Mount Washington,NBC News,"MEREDITH, N.H. — The steep bowl at Tuckerman Ravine on New Hampshire’s Mount Washington has long made it a favorite spot for expert skiers and snowboarders who are seeking adventure beyond the comparative safety of the state’s ski areas.
But hard and icy conditions on Saturday turned the bowl deadly, with temperatures in the early afternoon reaching the low 20s and getting colder as the day progressed, according to National Weather Service data.
Madison Saltsburg, 20, died after falling about 600 vertical feet  down the ravine in the afternoon, according to the U.S. Forest Service. Two other skiers suffered serious injuries after falling and hitting rocks and ice. And there were a number of other falls witnessed throughout the day which didn’t result in serious injuries, the service said.
A telephone message to a forest service spokesperson seeking information about Saltsburg wasn’t immediately returned Sunday.
The day of accidents prompted search efforts that continued for hours in the dark as teams worked to rescue the injured skiers and remove Saltsburg’s body from the mountain. Heavy, wet snow started to fall Saturday night and winds began to pick up, forcing the rescuers to battle on through the worsening conditions.
“The snow rangers and emergency personnel were up there late last night. They’re exhausted,” said Colleen Mainville, a spokesperson for the forest service.
Tuckerman Ravine is particularly popular in the spring, when the sun begins to soften the snow. On some days, hundreds of skiers and snowboarders make the 3-mile hike to the ravine, resulting in a festive atmosphere. From there it can take another hour to kick boot steps in the wall to get to the top.
But risks — including open crevasses, avalanches and rocks — have resulted in several deaths over the years.
The forest service said Saltsburg and her skiing companion encountered hard and icy snow surfaces due to cold temperatures and a lack of recent snowfall. There were also open crevasse holes on the mountain, the service said, and conditions were unforgiving.
Forest service rangers and a team from the Mount Washington Avalanche Center also responded to two other skiers who suffered severe injuries that weren’t life-threatening, Mainville said.
At 6,288 feet Mount Washington is the tallest peak in the Northeast and is notorious for its fickle weather. It is the sight of frequent rescues.
Just the previous night, on Friday, a 23-year-old hiker from Kentucky was rescued from the mountain after going off trail and into the Ammonoosuc Ravine, New Hampshire Fish and Game reported.
The hiker “fell and hit his head and face, lost one of his sneakers, and eventually became hypothermic,” the agency said in a statement.
“He was given boots, food, warm drink, proper winter gear, and a headlamp. He was then escorted back to the trail and then to the Cog Railway parking lot,” the agency said.
Another hiker who was rescued from the Ammonoosuc Ravine in February described his 11-hour ordeal to The Associated Press, acknowledging he had made some poor decisions and was underprepared for his hike and crediting rescuers with saving his life.

2024-03-06T17:10:59.611Z,The key numbers to know from the Super Tuesday exit polls,NBC News,"Donald Trump continues to rack up wins across the map on Super Tuesday, the biggest primary day of the presidential race.
NBC News exit polls provide some clues about the coalition the former president has put together that has allowed him to cruise through the GOP nominating fight — and also where his weak spots could be in November.
The exit polls surveyed voters in Virginia, North Carolina and California, and NBC News projects that Trump will win all three states, defeating former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley.
The polls also surveyed voters who participated in California’s Senate primary and the GOP primary for governor in North Carolina, where Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson is projected to win the Republican nomination.
Here are some key takeaways from the NBC News exit polls so far:
Trump’s popularity among GOP base voters propelled him to victory in the early primary states and again on Super Tuesday. In Virginia, Trump won 79% of self-described GOP voters, who made up 60% of the electorate, while Haley won just 19% of Republicans. And Trump won the vast majority (77%) of conservative voters in Virginia, who made up two-thirds of the Virginia primary electorate.
In North Carolina, self-described Republicans made up 64% of the primary electorate and Trump won 86% of those voters. Trump also won 83% of self-described conservative voters, who made up a whopping 79% of the GOP primary electorate in the state.
And in California, Trump won 81% of self-identified Republicans, who made up two-thirds of the primary electorate.
The North Carolina and Virginia exit polls also show a similar trend to previous GOP contests: A majority of voters decided whom they would support before the primary became a two-person race between Trump and Haley. And most of those voters supported Trump.
In Virginia, nearly two-thirds of GOP primary voters (64%) said they decided whom to support before the start of this year, meaning before the first primary votes were cast in January. Trump overwhelmingly won those voters, 78% of whom backed him.
In North Carolina, 51% of GOP primary voters said they decided who to support before this year, with 83% of them supporting Trump.
Even as Trump further builds his massive delegate lead, the exit polls do provide some potential warning signs for him looking ahead to the general election, especially among more moderate and well-educated voters.
In both Virginia, North Carolina and California, around one-third of primary voters answered “no” to the question of whether they will vote for the GOP nominee regardless of who it is (31% in Virginia, 34% in North Carolina and 33% in California).
Similar shares of primary voters — 37% in Virginia and 31% in North Carolina — said that Trump, currently facing four indictments, would not be fit to be president if he is convicted of a crime. A smaller share of California GOP primary voters (23%) also said Trump would not be fit to serve if convicted.
Trump also struggled among college-educated voters compared to the broader primary electorate, which could be a potential warning sign as well-educated voters have become key to the Democrats’ coalition.
Trump won 47% of voters with a college degree in Virginia, losing them to Haley by 3 points. He did win college-educated voters in North Carolina by 15 points, winning 56% of them. But in California, Trump won 71% of college-educated primary voters.
The GOP primary exit polls also provide some early signals about North Carolina’s race for governor. The race to replace term-limited Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper is expected to be the most competitive governor’s contest this year.
Trump endorsed Robinson in the GOP primary and recently described the lieutenant governor, who has a history of making offensive comments, as “Martin Luther King on steroids.”
The North Carolina exit poll showed Robinson’s victory was fueled by a lot of the groups that supported Trump in the presidential primary, which could be a sign that his fate in November will be closely tied to the former president’s.
Robinson won 76% of Trump voters in the primary — one of his best performances among various voter groups. He also won 76% of voters who described themselves as very conservative, 77% of voters who said the national economy is poor, and 77% of voters who said they favored a federal abortion ban. Robinson also won 79% of voters  who hold the unfounded belief that President Joe Biden did not legitimately win the 2020 election.
Robinson’s worst performances in the primary were among voters who described themselves as moderates or liberals. He won just 46% of those voters on Tuesday, per the exit poll.
NBC News projects that Robinson will face Democrat Josh Stein, the state attorney general, in November.

2024-03-13T20:18:09.340Z,Hunter Biden rejects House Republicans' request to testify publicly,NBC News,"Hunter Biden on Wednesday rejected a request from House Republicans to testify publicly at a hearing next week, with his attorney blasting the planned panel as a ""circus act.""
""Mr. Biden declines your invitation to this carnival side show,"" Abbe Lowell, an attorney for the president's son, said in a letter to House Oversight Committee chair Rep. James Comer, R-Ky.
Lowell’s letter said his client would consider testifying publicly before the committee if the panel also included “relatives of former President Trump.”
“If they schedule a legitimate hearing that includes Jared Kushner, Hunter will be there,” a source familiar with Hunter Biden’s legal strategy told NBC News.
Comer invited Biden to testify as part of his impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden on March 20. Also requested to testify at the hearing are two former Hunter Biden business associates who've been convicted of fraud, and a third whom the younger Biden has called an ""incompetent"" and an ""idiot.""
In his letter, Lowell said his client could not attend because he's due in court in California the next day, but ""the scheduling conflict is the least of the issues."" He said the hearing is not ""a proper proceeding but an obvious attempt to throw a Hail Mary pass after the game has ended,"" citing his client's over six hours of deposition testimony in which House Republicans did not identify evidence of a crime.
Lowell also noted that the Republican impeachment inquiry hit a roadblock when an FBI informant central to their probe was charged with lying to the bureau about the Bidens.
In a statement, Comer mocked Biden's response and said he still expected him to appear.
""Hunter Biden for months stated he wanted a public hearing, but now that one has been offered alongside his business associates that he worked with for years, he is refusing to come,"" Comer said, adding the hearing is moving forward.
Hunter Biden has not been subpoenaed to appear at the hearing, which Comer announced last week. The oversight chair said the hearing is titled “Influence Peddling: Examining Joe Biden’s Abuse of Public Office” and that he's invited former Hunter Biden business associates Jason Galanis, Devon Archer and Tony Bobulinski.
It's unclear which of the witnesses will actually appear. A spokesperson for the committee did not immediately respond to an inquiry.
Galanis is serving a 14-year prison sentence for two multimillion-dollar fraud schemes. Archer was convicted in connection with one of those schemes and has been sentenced to just over a year in prison, but has not yet begun serving his time.
Bobulinski and Hunter Biden, meanwhile, have repeatedly disparaged each other publicly. Bobulinski told the committee at a deposition last month that the only reason Biden was able to make millions from a variety of foreign sources was because his father was vice president at the time.
Hunter Biden testified before the committee behind closed doors last month, telling the panel that Bobulinski was a ""bitter, bitter man"" who has an axe to grind because he backed out of doing a business deal with him.
Hunter Biden, 54, also testified that the central allegation of the impeachment inquiry — that his father was involved with and profited from his business dealings — was baseless. “My father has never been involved in my business. I have never asked my father to be involved in my business. My father has never benefited from my business, and I have never asked anyone — or my father — to do anything for the benefit of anyone I’ve ever done business for,” he said, according to a transcript.
House Republicans have indicated that their support for the public hearing, and the impeachment inquiry overall, is waning, and they may pursue other avenues of investigation as a successful impeachment of the president looks increasingly unlikely.

2024-03-06T16:50:09.315Z,Mitch McConnell endorses Donald Trump for president,NBC News,"WASHINGTON — Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell endorsed Donald Trump's bid to return to the White House on Wednesday after a dominant Super Tuesday performance by the former president.
“It is abundantly clear that former President Trump has earned the requisite support of Republican voters to be our nominee for President of the United States. It should come as no surprise that, as nominee, he will have my support,"" said McConnell, R-Ky.
McConnell was the highest-profile Republican who had yet to endorse Trump. Asked repeatedly whether he would back Trump in recent months, McConnell demurred, telling reporters he would back the party's eventual nominee.
McConnell issued his endorsement shortly after former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley ended her campaign.
In his statement Wednesday, McConnell highlighted the ""great things"" he and Trump accomplished during his presidency, including remaking the federal judiciary and installing three conservative justices on the Supreme Court.
""I look forward to the opportunity of switching from playing defense against the terrible policies the Biden administration has pursued to a sustained offense geared towards making a real difference in improving the lives of the American people,"" he said.
McConnell and Trump have long had a frosty relationship, which turned even icier after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. McConnell voted to acquit Trump in his impeachment trial related to the Capitol riot, but he gave a speech laying blame for the mob's attack directly on Trump. The two men did not speak for at least three years.
“There’s no question, none, that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day. No question about it,” McConnell said on the Senate floor after Trump was acquitted in the Senate trial. “The people who stormed this building believed they were acting on the wishes and instructions of their president.”
McConnell has repeatedly broken with Trump and his supporters publicly in backing additional aid to Ukraine. Trump has also made racist attacks targeting McConnell’s wife, Elaine Chao, who was transportation secretary during the Trump administration.
Still, aides to both Republicans had been holding back-channel discussions seeking an endorsement for Trump from McConnell, sources said last month.
McConnell, whose grip on the Senate Republican conference has waned as Trump's has grown, announced that he will step down as leader at the end of the year.
Despite past public and private disagreements with Trump, McConnell has said he would support the Republican nominee, even if it was Trump.
In February 2021, a month after the Capitol attack, McConnell told Fox News that he “absolutely” would get behind Trump if he became the Republican nominee in 2024.
Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, the only other member of Senate GOP leadership who had not endorsed Trump, added her own endorsement on X not long after McConnell released his statement. ""We must beat Joe Biden and get this country back on track. Donald Trump has my support,"" she wrote.
Members of the Senate GOP conference had cited McConnell’s lack of a relationship with Trump as a reason they thought it made sense for him to step down as leader at the end of the year.

2024-03-06T21:27:20.477Z,Trump says he will debate Biden 'anytime',NBC News,"Former President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he will debate President Joe Biden ""anytime, anywhere, anyplace"" as the two men turned their attention toward a general election rematch a day after dominating Super Tuesday primaries.
""It is important for the Good of our Country, that Joe Biden and I Debate issues that are so vital to American, and the American people,"" Trump wrote on the Truth Social media platform. ""Therefore, I am calling for Debates, ANYTIME, ANYWHERE, ANYPLACE!""
Follow live coverage here.
Trump declined to take part in Republican primary debates and has been critical of general-election candidate matchups hosted by the long-standing Commission on Presidential Debates. But on Wednesday, he said he would go toe-to-toe with Biden in commission debates — or even debates hosted by the Democratic National Committee — if the president will agree.
Biden has not yet said whether he will debate Trump before the November election. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre deflected a question from Fox News earlier Wednesday about whether dodging debates would cast doubt on Biden's ""acuity.""
""Talk to the campaign,"" Jean-Pierre said.
In a statement, Biden campaign spokesperson Michael Tyler declined to address whether the president would debate, suggesting that's a discussion for later date.
""I know Donald Trump’s thirsty for attention and struggling to expand his appeal beyond the MAGA base — and that’s a conversation we’ll have at the appropriate time in this cycle,"" Tyler said. ""But if he’s so desperate to see President Biden in prime time, he doesn’t have to wait! He can join the tens of millions of Americans who will tune in to watch the State of the Union tomorrow night. He might even learn a thing or two about bringing people together and actually delivering for the American people.”
Biden and Trump debated twice in 2020, when the middle meeting of three scheduled debates was canceled following Trump's refusal to conduct it virtually due to Covid-19.

2024-03-07T00:37:20.555Z,House Republicans set date for public testimony from Hunter Biden,NBC News,"WASHINGTON — The Republican-led House Oversight Committee said Wednesday that Hunter Biden has been invited to testify publicly this month at a hearing focused on the GOP impeachment inquiry into his father, President Joe Biden.
It was not immediately clear whether he had agreed to appear at the March 20 hearing. Sources told NBC News this week that as of Monday the two sides had not discussed a possible date for public testimony.
A representative for Hunter Biden’s legal team said Wednesday that it would respond to the committee's invitation in writing.
Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., the committee chair, said in a statement Wednesday that given his ""repeated calls for a public hearing, I fully expect Hunter Biden to appear for a scheduled Oversight Committee hearing on March 20, alongside Biden family business associates.""
The hearing will ""examine inconsistencies among the witnesses’ testimonies in order to get the truth for the American people,"" Comer said.
The committee also invited Devon Archer, Jason Galanis and Tony Bobulinski — all former business associates of Biden’s — to testify March 20.
When Biden, 54, testified last week at a closed-door deposition on Capitol Hill, he repeatedly denied that his father had any involvement with his business dealings.
“My father has never been involved in my business. I have never asked my father to be involved in my business. My father has never benefited from my business, and I have never asked anyone — or my father — to do anything for the benefit of anyone I’ve ever done business for,” he said, according to a transcript of the deposition.
Biden also testified that his relationship with Bobulinski ended poorly when he backed out of doing a business deal with him. He called Bobulinski an “incompetent and an idiot,” as well as a “bitter, bitter man.”
Bobulinski told the committee at his own deposition last month that the only reason Biden was able to make millions from a variety of foreign sources was because his father was vice president at the time.
Republicans have also pointed to testimony from Archer, another former business partner, who testified that Biden put his father on speakerphone about 20 times while they were with business associates.
“He can’t recall the specific times that I put my dad on speakerphone when I was at a dinner or at a social event, so that means, over the course of 10 years, twice a year, my dad would call me, and I would be in the middle of a dinner, and I always answer his call. I always answer his call, based upon my life’s experience,” Biden told the committees last month, citing his father's loss of his first wife and two of his children.
Galanis, another one of the invited witnesses, will almost certainly not attend in person — he is serving a 14-year prison sentence for two multimillion-dollar fraud schemes. The House committees leading the impeachment inquiry interviewed him Feb. 23 from the federal prison camp in Montgomery, Alabama.
Archer was convicted in connection with one of Galanis' schemes and sentenced to just over a year in prison. He lost his appeal of the conviction to the Supreme Court in January but has yet to begin serving his sentence while the judge in the case weighs his request to reconsider the length of his sentence.
The top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, ripped the GOP's lineup of witnesses for the coming hearing.
“It seems Chairman Comer has decided his best witnesses now include a federally incarcerated ‘serial fraudster’ and a bitterly frustrated would-be business partner who collaborated with the Trump campaign,"" Raskin said in a statement that included links to news articles about Galanis and Bobulinski. ""Unfortunately for Chairman Comer, even these dubious witnesses have already testified that they have no evidence that Joe Biden took any official actions to benefit Hunter Biden’s business ventures.""
“In their last hearing, I urged them to fold up the circus tent, but they just came back with a three-ring circus instead,” he said.
A source familiar with Biden's legal strategy said, ""Comer is desperate to keep alive an impeachment inquiry that died when Hunter Biden testified for almost seven hours last week.”
The impeachment inquiry took a major hit last month when an FBI informant whose claims of Biden family corruption Comer and other top Republicans had repeatedly touted was charged with lying about those allegations. Alexander Smirnov, according to prosecutors with special counsel David Weiss’ office, “provided false derogatory information to the FBI” about the Bidens, including the false allegation that officials with Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company that employed Biden, had paid him and his father $5 million.
Biden testified behind closed doors last week after months of a heated back-and-forth with the committee. He initially said he would be willing to testify only at a public hearing, citing concerns that Republicans might take parts of his testimony out of context.
GOP lawmakers rejected his offer to testify publicly, and Biden defied a subpoena for closed-door testimony, instead holding a news conference outside the Capitol in December.
House Republicans then pushed for a resolution to hold him in contempt of Congress. Biden relented after GOP lawmakers issued new subpoenas after they formally announced an impeachment inquiry.
Asked at his deposition last week whether he thought Archer, Bobulinski and Galanis had any expectation that his father could be involved in their business dealings, Biden responded: ""Not an expectation from me. And I think that you’d see in my communications to them, there was never a single time that I can remember in which I say, 'Hey, we’ll get my dad involved,' 'Hey, let’s get my dad on the phone,' 'Hey, you know, let’s — you know, what can we get from my dad out of this?'”

2024-03-10T16:17:14.970Z,Sen. Katie Britt attempts to clean up her misleading State of the Union response,NBC News,"Alabama GOP Sen. Katie Britt on Sunday responded to allegations that her response to President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address was misleading.
The criticism centers on a story Britt told about a victim of human trafficking, which she implied happened during Biden’s tenure.
Britt spoke in her Thursday-night speech about visiting the U.S.-Mexico border in 2023 and speaking to this woman.
“She had been sex-trafficked by the cartels starting at age 12. She told me not just that she was raped every day, but how many times a day she was raped,” Britt said in her response to the State of the Union.
“We wouldn’t be OK with this happening in a Third World country. This is the United States of America, and it is past time, in my opinion, that we start acting like it,” she added. “President Biden’s border crisis is a disgrace.”
Shortly after the address, a viral social media post by journalist Jonathan Katz looked more closely at the story and noted that the trafficking did not happen during Biden’s presidency, or even in the United States; it happened during the administration of President George W. Bush, in Mexico.
On “Fox News Sunday,” Britt did not acknowledge making any mistake or leaving a wrong impression.
She was asked whether she meant to give the impression that the story she told about a victim of human trafficking happened during Biden’s tenure.
“No,” Britt answered, adding later: “I very clearly said I spoke to a woman who told me about when she was trafficked when she was 12, so I didn’t say a teenager. I didn’t say a young woman, a grown woman, a woman when she was trafficked when she was 12.”
She doubled down on her Thursday statement that Biden “didn’t just create this border crisis. He invited it with 94 executive actions in his first 100 days.”
“I very specifically said this is what President Biden did during his first 100 days. Minutes after coming into office he stopped all deportations, he halted construction of the border wall,” she said Sunday. (The Biden administration attempted to institute a 100-day pause on mass deportations after taking office, but that moratorium was later halted by a judge.)
Though Britt did not offer the victim’s name in her speech Thursday, a spokesperson for her office told The Washington Post that she was referring to Karla Jacinto Romero, a trafficking victims’ rights advocate who testified before Congress in 2015 about what happened to her as a girl.
Britt’s office did not respond to a request for comment from NBC News on Saturday.
The White House shot back at the Republican senator, accusing Britt of relying on “debunked lies” to attack Biden.
“Instead of telling more debunked lies to justify opposing the toughest bipartisan border legislation in modern history, Senator Britt should stop choosing human smugglers and fentanyl traffickers over our national security and the Border Patrol Union,” White House Deputy Press Secretary Andrew Bates said in a statement. “Like President Biden said in his State of the Union, ‘We have a simple choice: We can fight about fixing the border or we can fix it.’”
In her 2015 congressional testimony, Jacinto Romero told lawmakers through an interpreter, “For more than four years of my life from the age of 12 ... I fell prey to a professional pimp who, after three months of wooing and me treating me as a princess, propped me up on a corner and forced me to work the streets for his own gain. For years and years, I was coerced, intimidated, threatened, beaten, robbed of my children and emotionally and sexually violated time and time again.”
Jacinto Romero was 22 at the time of her testimony, meaning the experience she described began roughly a decade earlier.
Britt met Jacinto Romero in January 2023 during a trip to the Del Rio sector of the U.S.-Mexico border, where she was accompanied by Fox News contributor Sara Carter, former Mexican politician and victims advocate Rosa María de la Garza Ramírez, and GOP Sens. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee and Cindy Hyde-Smith of Mississippi.
On an episode of “The Sara Carter Show” released the same day as the trip, Carter said she introduced Jacinto Romero to the senators, telling listeners, “She talked very vividly and candidly with lawmakers ... about what was happening to her, about people buying her.”
Republicans have long criticized Biden’s handling of the border, arguing that the president has been ineffective at stopping the rampant migrant crossings along the southern border. The Biden administration has countered that Congress has been unwilling to step up to the plate since the bipartisan border deal fell apart, and the president is reportedly considering taking executive action to deter migration.

2024-03-08T05:17:55.499Z,Former Rep. George Santos announces run for Congress,NBC News,"Former Rep. George Santos announced Thursday night that he will run for New York's 1st Congressional District, challenging a Republican who voted to expel him from Congress.
""Tonight, I want to announce that I will be returning to the arena of politics and challenging Nick for the battle over #NY1,"" Santos wrote on X, referring to Rep. Nick LaLota.
Santos argued that ""New York hasn’t had a real conservative represent them since I left office arbitrarily, thanks to RINO, empty suits like [LaLota].""
""I look forward to debating him on the issues and on his weak record as a Republican,"" he added.
The tweet was posted during President Joe Biden's State of the Union address.
Asked by NBC News about Santos’ announcement, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., said, “I wasn’t aware he was doing that.”
In a fundraising post shortly after the announcement, LaLota said: “To raise the standard in Congress, and to hold a pathological liar who stole an election accountable, I led the charge to expel George Santos. If finishing the job requires beating him in a primary, count me in.""
Santos was elected in 2022 to represent New York's 3rd District, based in Long Island and Queens. He was part of a group of New York Republican representatives, elected in districts Biden won just two years earlier, who were instrumental in helping the GOP gain a majority in the House.
The other members, including LaLota and Rep. Mike Lawler, were vocal in their efforts to expel Santos after reports emerged that he had fabricated large parts of his résumé, including his college education, employment background and identity as “Jew-ish.”
A House ethics report released in November alleged that Santos spent campaign funds on luxury goods, Botox and OnlyFans payments. Santos denies the allegations, and in the wake of the report, he refused to step down but said he would not run for office again.
A few weeks later, the House voted to expel him 311-114, with 105 Republicans voting in favor. He became the sixth member of Congress ever to be expelled and the only one to be expelled without being convicted of a crime or having supported the Confederacy.
Since he left Congress, Santos has been active on social media and on the platform Cameo, where he is paid for short, personalized video messages. He has sued late night host Jimmy Kimmel for fraud and copyright infringement for allegedly using fake names to request videos that Kimmel played on his show.
Santos faces 23 federal charges, including identity theft and campaign finance fraud. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges.
The primary will be June 25.

2024-03-08T01:14:07.798Z,Judge in classified documents case will hear Trump motions to dismiss next week,NBC News,"U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon will hear arguments on two of Donald Trump’s motions to dismiss the classified documents case against him in Florida, according to a new order issued Thursday.
At a hearing next Thursday, Trump’s legal team and prosecutors for the special counsel will have the opportunity to argue their positions on whether some or all of the charges against Trump should be thrown out because of the Presidential Records Act before the case goes to trial.
The two sides will also discuss a second motion to dismiss the case on the theory that the main statute used against Trump is unconstitutionally vague as it applies to presidents.
Trump has pressed for the judge to dismiss the charges of retaining and mishandling classified government documents after he left office and resisting the government's efforts to retrieve them.
The hearing is set for 10 a.m. next Thursday in Fort Pierce, Florida.
Special counsel Jack Smith urged Cannon on Thursday to reject Trump’s claims that his presidential records “can be transformed into ‘personal’ records” upon their being removed from the White House, according to court records.
The filing was one of five briefs filed by prosecutors responding to Trump’s motions to dismiss the case, including his arguments that he is entitled to retain “personal” records under the Presidential Records Act, that he should be immune from prosecution for removing documents because he was still president at the time and that he is being selectively prosecuted, as well as because of the vagueness of the statute used in the charges.
Responding to Trump's “frivolous claim” to dismiss the case on presidential immunity grounds, Smith called on Cannon to deny the motion.
Smith said adopting Trump’s immunity theory could lead to “sobering” outcomes, warning that under the former president’s position, a president could use the military to murder a political opponent or could “sell classified information to an adversary—and as long as he was not impeached by the House and convicted by the Senate, he could act with impunity.”
Trump’s “transparent and persistent” efforts to delay the case also merit a finding of “frivolousness,” Smith said.
Trump faces multiple criminal charges in the indictment, including willful retention of national defense information, false statements and representations, conspiracy to obstruct justice, withholding a document or record and corruptly concealing a document. He has pleaded not guilty to all counts.

2024-03-12T12:39:40.279Z,Transcript of Biden's interview with special counsel Robert Hur shows memory lapses — but also detailed exchanges,NBC News,"WASHINGTON — Special counsel Robert Hur’s bombshell report on President Joe Biden’s handling of classified documents concluded that he presented himself as an “elderly man with a poor memory” who was unable to remember key dates, including when he served as vice president or the year his son died.
Biden, for his part, has lambasted Hur for bringing up the topic of Beau Biden’s death, and his lawyers have criticized the report.
But the transcript of Biden’s interview, which was reviewed by NBC News, paints a more nuanced picture on both sides.
Follow live coverage of Hur's testimony here.
Despite the president’s assertion that Hur brought up his son’s death first, the transcript shows that it was Biden himself who did so, as NBC News has reported.
Biden, who often appeared to be thinking out loud in response to specific questions, at other points recalls in detail specific events from his time as vice president.
Biden spoke with Hur for 3½ hours Oct. 8, and for 90 minutes the next day. The timing was fraught, with a major international crisis having broken out Oct. 7 when Hamas attacked Israel.
Biden faced a barrage of questions from Hur and another federal prosecutor about documents he saw as vice president, where and how he stored them and why some sensitive materials remained in his possession for more than five years after he left office as vice president.
At one point, Hur acknowledged that some of his questions would “relate to events that happened years ago.” Biden joked in response: “I’m a young man, so it’s not a problem.”
According to the review of the transcript, Biden at times expanded beyond the narrow subject areas of particular questions. At one point, he described in vivid detail a 2011 visit to Mongolia, where he displayed unexpected archery skills at a cultural performance in his honor.
Biden also often said he could not recall a specific incident or, for instance, why certain items were packed in certain ways. And at times, he or his attorneys challenged the prosecutors about the relevance or accuracy of questions they posed, with Biden at one point challenging the logic of one of Hur’s lines of questioning.
The full transcript was provided to Congress on Tuesday, according to a source familiar with the matter. House Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, and Oversight Committee Chair James Comer, R-Ky., subpoenaed it and other materials related to the investigation.
Biden allies believe a full reading of the transcript will only bolster their contention that Hur’s characterization of Biden during the interview was not based in reality. If anything, they argue, Hur’s at-times meandering questioning may have contributed to the confusion.
Hur’s assessment of Biden’s mental fitness is likely to be front and center as Hur makes his first public appearance since the report was released last month, testifying Tuesday before Republican-led committees on Capitol Hill.
In his opening statement, Hur planned to defend his investigation, the final report and his treatment of Biden’s age.
“I knew that for my decision to be credible, I could not simply announce that I recommended no criminal charges and leave it at that. I needed to explain why,” Hur planned to say, according to an advance copy of his remarks.
In discussing the president’s age, Hur will say that his characterization was “necessary and accurate and fair.”
“What I wrote is what I believe the evidence shows, and what I expect jurors would perceive and believe,"" he will say. ""I did not sanitize my explanation. Nor did I disparage the President unfairly.”
While the White House welcomed Hur’s decision not to bring criminal charges, officials bitterly protested against the report he submitted to the Justice Department. Bob Bauer, the president’s personal attorney, accused Hur of “investigative excess” and said his report “flouts Department regulations and norms.”
In a letter to Hur before the report was released, Bauer and Richard Sauber, special counsel to the president, said that Hur’s comments about Biden’s memory were not “accurate or appropriate” and that they used “highly prejudicial language to describe a commonplace occurrence among witnesses: a lack of recall of years-old events.”
Speaking to reporters the night the report came out, Biden flashed anger at Hur’s suggestion that he did not recall, “even within several years, when his son Beau died.”
“How in the hell dare he raise that?” Biden said. “I don’t need anyone, I don’t need anyone to remind me of when he passed away.”
Hur’s yearlong probe took him deep in the weeds of perhaps the most fraught period of Biden’s half-century in public life. Biden left office in 2017, nearly two years after he buried his son. Beau Biden’s death from cancer and Biden's decision not to seek the presidency in 2016 began an unpredictable series of events that would ultimately take him back to the White House in 2021.
It was in trying to share some of that timeline that Biden, in his interview with Hur, made a mistake that Hur ultimately seized on in his report’s damning conclusion.
But even though Biden said Hur brought up the subject of his son’s death, it was, as NBC News has reported, first raised by Biden himself. Roughly midway through the first day of his interview, Hur asked Biden about where he might have stored documents related to the work he was engaged in after he left the vice presidency in 2017.
“Remember, in this time frame, my son is — either been deployed or is dying,” Biden said.
As he continued thinking back to the period, he appeared to conflate his consideration of running in the 2016 election, in the months after Beau Biden died in 2015, with the early considerations of a 2020 bid after he left office.
“Even though I’m at Penn,” he said, referring to the Penn Biden Center, which was established after he left office, “I hadn’t walked away from the idea that I may run for office again.”
Biden then asked what month his son died before quickly stating the date: May 30. The transcript indicates others present interjected to specify the year: 2015.
“And Trump got elected in November of 2017,” he said, before the transcript indicates another participant corrected him to say 2016.
“Yeah, OK. But that’s when Trump gets sworn in then,” he said, before he went into a description of the book “Promise Me, Dad,” which he would spend the next year writing, documenting the years leading up to and following his son’s death.
“This is personal,” he said.
There were other points during the two days of questioning when Biden appeared to misalign specific events to the right years. Discussing the moving of items in 2019 from a home he rented in Virginia to Delaware, he said he needed the furniture to set up a home studio to do media appearances during the coronavirus pandemic, which began a year later.
Those moments are likely to provide fodder for Republicans eager to further political attacks on Biden’s ability to continue serving in office. Tuesday’s hearing comes just days after Biden’s performance in the State of the Union address, which was applauded by fellow Democrats.
A full reading of the more than 250 pages of the transcripts reveals often mundane and prolonged back-and-forth discussions between Biden and the prosecutors about the ways he reviewed classified documents as vice president and how his belongings were transported among the White House, his Delaware home and other locations.
The two days of questioning had minimal breaks, with Biden often rejecting suggestions to pause the proceedings.
“I’d rather just keep going. I’ll go all night if we get this done,” he said toward the end of the first day’s session.
Biden’s lawyers at times interjected when they took issue with prosecutors’ line of questioning, with Bauer at one point telling Hur he should not “put him in a position where he has to speculate or create assumptions, or try to engage in detective work.”
“I think we’re kind of going down a trail here that I find confusing,” Bauer said at another point. “They’re obviously trying to establish something,” Biden surmised.
Biden’s careerlong work in foreign policy was evident from start to finish. The sessions began with Hur acknowledging, without specifying, the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel.
“I know there’s a lot of other things in the world going on that demand your attention,” Hur began. “We may be interrupted by one,” Biden responded, adding he had just spoken to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Biden at another point described the role he played as President Barack Obama’s No. 2.
“I’d be the guy that’d basically take the heat, which I was prepared to do because I knew as much as they did,” Biden said, referring to early deliberations in the Obama administration about the future of the war in Afghanistan.
He also noted that some of the issues he was dealing with as vice president continue today. One significantly redacted part of the transcript comes in the context of Biden’s recalling meetings he held as vice president with lawmakers in connection with the Iran nuclear deal. And discussing items Justice Department officials found about Pope Francis’ visit to the U.S. in 2015, Biden noted he remains in touch with Francis.
“He’s my ticket,” Biden said, before making it clear he was joking.
Even amid tense discussions, Biden often found ways to lighten the mood. At several points he teased investigators about their various searches of his properties.
“I just hope you didn’t find any risqué pictures of my wife in a bathing suit, which you probably did. She’s beautiful,” Biden said at one point.
After a prolonged discussion of boxes found in Biden’s garage, Hur asked colleagues whether there were any other questions.
“Yeah. When am I going to get the rest of it cleaned out?” Biden said.
Biden was particularly keen at one point to discuss his love of cars, in connection with questioning about boxes found near his Corvette. At one point the transcript includes “Makes Car Sound” to capture Biden’s comments.

2024-03-08T17:48:38.387Z,Iowa Republicans pass personhood bill that critics say could threaten IVF care,NBC News,"Iowa Republicans passed a personhood bill in the state House on Thursday night that would make it a felony to “cause the death” of an “unborn person,” putting the conservative Midwestern state directly into the national battle over protections for in vitro fertilization.
The bill in its current form does not provide any protections for embryos created via IVF — which, according to Democrats in the state and reproductive rights advocates, means the measure could easily be interpreted as criminalizing IVF care and services.
Passage of the bill by the GOP-controlled state House makes Iowa the latest state where lawmakers have taken steps that could threaten IVF. The procedure involves the creation of embryos outside the body, and many are often discarded if not used.
The vote in Iowa came just hours after Republican lawmakers in Alabama — trying to curtail the fallout over a state Supreme Court ruling that said embryos are children — enacted a bill intended to protect IVF.  The Alabama court’s ruling has prompted broader concerns that conservative measures targeting abortion elsewhere would also go after the fertility procedure.
To be enacted, the Iowa bill would still have to be passed by the state Senate and signed by Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds.
A spokesperson for Reynolds didn’t respond to questions about whether she supported the bill.
The Iowa bill in its current form states that “a person who causes the death of an unborn person without the consent of the pregnant person” is “guilty of a class ‘A’ felony” and that “a person who unintentionally causes the death of an unborn person” is “guilty of a class ‘B’ felony.”
A class A felony is the most serious criminal offense under Iowa state law and is punishable by up to a mandatory life sentence without the possibility of parole. A class B felony under Iowa law is punishable by up to 25 years in prison.
The bill defines an “unborn person” as a human “individual organism” from “fertilization to live birth.”
In its current form, the bill does not include any protections that would specifically or broadly apply to IVF.
For example, the bill does not include language that many reproductive rights advocates have said serves as protection for IVF, like clarifying that the term “unborn person” refers to being “in utero” or “carried in the womb.” Reproductive rights advocates say those phrases serve to make such statutes enforceable only in situations where the embryo or fetus is being carried in the womb — not outside the womb, as is the case in the early phases of IVF.
The bill was sponsored by the Republican-controlled House Judiciary Committee, not individual lawmakers. The Republican leaders of that committee — state Reps. Steven Holt, the chair, and Bill Gustoff, the vice chair — didn’t respond to questions from NBC News.
Democrats said the move to pursue the bill ignored the national fallout over the IVF restrictions that arose from the Alabama Supreme Court’s ruling last month.
“Iowa Republicans will stop at nothing to ban abortion, even if it means criminalizing people undergoing IVF treatments,” Iowa state Rep. Jennifer Konfrst, the Democratic minority leader, said in a statement to NBC News. “The Alabama-style bill Republican politicians passed this week goes too far and Iowans are tired of politicians taking away their reproductive freedom.”
Planned Parenthood Advocates of Iowa spokesperson Mazie Stilwell called the bill “shameful” and “reckless,” and said it was the latest step in Iowa Republicans’ “far-reaching, long-term strategy to undermine the rights and well-being of pregnant Iowans.”
National groups weighed in as well.
“In a country full of Republican legislators trying to outdo each other in rolling back fundamental freedoms, this Iowa bill shows that what happened in Alabama last month doesn’t just stay in one state,” said Heather Williams, president of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, the national Democratic arm that helps oversee state legislative races.
The personhood bill in Iowa is one of several that reproductive rights groups have said could be interpreted to restrict IVF treatments if enacted.
The Alabama Supreme Court ruling established that embryos created through IVF are considered children, prompting several IVF clinics in the state to halt their services and igniting a tumultuous weekslong sprint by lawmakers in the ruby-red state to contain the backlash.
Ultimately, Alabama GOP Gov. Kay Ivey signed a narrowly tailored, Republican-proposed bill Wednesday night intended to protect doctors, clinics and other health care personnel who provide IVF treatment and services by offering such workers civil and criminal “immunity.”

,"Chuck Schumer calls for new elections in Israel, criticizing Netanyahu's leadership",NBC News,"WASHINGTON — In the most significant criticism made by a U.S. leader against the Israeli government since its war with Hamas began, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Thursday called for new elections in Israel to replace Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Schumer, the highest-ranking Jewish official in the U.S., said in remarks on the Senate floor that “the Netanyahu coalition no longer fits the needs of Israel after Oct. 7.”
“The world has changed — radically — since then, and the Israeli people are being stifled right now by a governing vision that is stuck in the past,” Schumer said in what was billed as a major address by the Democratic leader from New York.
Netanyahu has “lost his way,” Schumer continued, “by allowing his political survival to take precedence over the best interests of Israel.” Schumer said that Netanyahu has aligned himself with “far-right extremists” like Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, who he said are “pushing support for Israel worldwide to historic lows.”
“Israel cannot survive if it becomes a pariah,” the majority leader said.
Schumer argued that Israel must make “course corrections” in its strategy against Hamas and make a better effort to protect Palestinian civilians in Gaza. They “do not deserve to suffer for the sins of Hamas, and Israel as a moral obligation to do better,” he said. “The United States has an obligation to do better.”
Schumer expressed support for a temporary cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, as President Joe Biden has been pushing for, saying it “would allow for the return of hostages and humanitarian relief of suffering Palestinians.” He said he’s against a permanent cease-fire because he said it would only allow Hamas to “regroup and launch further attacks on Israeli civilians.”
“There can never be a two-state solution if Hamas has any significant power,” he said.

2024-03-12T17:56:28.447Z,Map: 29 million Americans live under new voter ID laws put in place since 2020,NBC News,"Voters in particular states will encounter stricter voter ID requirements when they head to the polls as part of a wave of in-person voter ID laws enacted across the country during the last four years.
Eight states have enacted voter ID laws since the 2020 election, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures: Arkansas, Idaho, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio and Wyoming. The rash of new laws affects 29 million adults. One in 6 voters live in anticipated 2024 battleground states — Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — with new ID requirements.
Policies vary widely from state to state. In Ohio, acceptable forms of identification are limited to those issued by state or federal governments, such as driver’s licenses or passports, while North Carolina accepts student IDs, as well as military, public assistance and tribal cards. Certain states allow voters to request free ID cards or sign affidavits verifying their identities if they do not have IDs.
The stricter requirements ahead of Tuesday’s primary elections were years in the making. North Carolina’s law, passed in 2018, was blocked three years later by the state Supreme Court, which ruled the law was “motivated at least in part by an unconstitutional intent to target African American voters.”
The court reversed that decision last year after the election of two GOP justices, allowing the law to go into effect. A federal lawsuit against it is set to go to trial this spring, The Associated Press reported.
Arkansas’ new law no longer allows voters to sign affidavits verifying their identities in place of showing IDs — something many states still offer. Instead, voters are now required to return to the polling places with photo IDs within a set time frame for their provisional ballots to count.
Requesting some form of identification from voters dates to the 1950s, but two Supreme Court decisions in the past two decades have paved the way for states to require IDs. In 2008, the court ruled that an Indiana law requiring voters to present photo IDs did not violate the Constitution.
In 2013, another decision stripped a section of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that required states with histories of voter discrimination to get federal approval to make changes that affect voting.
Since that requirement was removed, at least 25 voter ID laws have been implemented — some of which have been struck down in court, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, a law and public policy group that tracks election laws.
Voter ID requirements are not inherently unpopular, and a recent Pew Research Center poll found more than 8 in 10 Americans supported requiring government-issued photo identification for voting.
Many of the recent ID laws gained momentum after former President Donald Trump and his allies made repeated, unfounded claims that voter fraud affected the outcome of the 2020 election. Trump’s challenges to the election have consistently lost in court, and state officials across the country have debunked fraud claims.
Studies have found voter fraud rates to be exceptionally low, which Ohio state Rep. Thomas Hall, a Republican who sponsored a law to require state-issued photo IDs, acknowledges. Still, Hall believes the law gives voters “peace of mind” that elections are secure.
“I think voter ID just took that ‘exceedingly rare’ and made it almost impossible here in Ohio,” he said.
Missouri state Rep. John Simmons, a Republican who sponsored legislation requiring a state-issued photo ID, said that election fraud cases are low priority for prosecutors and that requirement is a “commonsense” way to prevent such cases.
“Just because I don’t get broken into my home doesn’t mean I’m not going to lock my doors at night,” Simmons said. “We’ve got to get back to making sure we have confidence in the government.”
Voting rights advocates say strict ID laws have had a direct effect on voter turnout and disproportionately deter low-income people and people of color from voting.
“The policy of voter ID is responding to a problem that is not there, and so we have to be skeptical as to why states would put these policies in place if the justification for them is lacking,” said Eliza Sweren-Becker, senior counsel at the Brennan Center.
Sweren-Becker added that the barriers to voting created by ID laws are “part and parcel of an overall effort to make it harder for Americans to participate” in elections. States such as North Carolina, Georgia, Arkansas and Missouri implemented ID requirements alongside other election changes regarding absentee voting, early voting, signature matching and more.
Nearly 29 million Americans did not have current driver’s licenses and 7.6 million did not have any nonexpired government-issued photo IDs in 2020, according to a University of Maryland report that used a representative sample from an American National Election Studies survey. Survey participants who identified as Black or Hispanic were twice as likely as other groups to lack photo IDs, and 18- to 29-year-olds in these demographics were the least likely to have driver’s licenses or any photo ID out of all other groups.
“The unfortunate reality is that lawmakers tailor these laws to exclude certain types of voters,” said Molly McGrath, a voting rights attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union. “And it works.”
Identification requirements can bring about disparities in other ways. Texas’ 2021 voting law required mail voters to list their ID numbers or partial Social Security numbers on both mail ballot applications and ballot envelopes themselves, which must match the information on their voter registrations. The Brennan Center found that in the state’s 2022 primary election, Latino, Asian and Black voters were at least 30% more likely to have application or mail ballots rejected because of the new requirement compared to white voters. Some voters did not have matching information, and others left it blank because they did not see it or thought it was optional, NPR reported.
Transgender people can also be caught up by voter ID laws. The Williams Institute, a think tank at UCLA Law, estimated that 260,000 transgender people living in states with voter ID laws did not have a form of ID that accurately reflected their names or gender identities for the 2020 general election. In the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey, 25% of respondents reported being verbally harassed by poll workers after having shown IDs that did not match their current names or gender identities.
Updating ID gender markers can be arduous for transgender people. Eight states require proof of gender-affirming surgery, and two states do not allow ID changes. All of those states also have voter ID requirements.
A Pew Research poll found that 1 in 5 registered voters did not know they would be asked to show IDs to vote going into the 2016 election.
“Most people think about what they need to vote, meeting deadlines and everything else, just within the months or weeks before the election,” said McGrath, who expects the new requirements will surprise voters during the primaries. “Voters are busy; they have lives.”
More voting laws are coming. Hall, the Ohio state representative who is running for re-election, said he and his colleagues hope to pass more legislation in the name of election integrity in the near future.
Those against ID requirements like Ohio’s say the push for stricter election laws will continue to inhibit voters.
“We are seeing a sort of death-by-a-thousand-cuts approach to voting rights,” Sweren-Becker said.
CLARIFICATION (March 4, 2024 5:20 p.m. ET): This article has been updated to clarify that the measures in question are specifically about identification for in-person voting, not for all voting in general.

2024-03-12T20:41:15.815Z,Federal courts make it harder to 'judge-shop' as was done in abortion pill case,NBC News,"WASHINGTON — When anti-abortion-rights activists drafted a lawsuit seeking to overturn federal approval of the abortion pill mifepristone, they filed it in a court in Texas where they were guaranteed a judge who they thought would be friendly to their point of view.
That judge, Amarillo-based Matthew Kacsmaryk, who was once a conservative legal activist and was appointed by former President Donald Trump, subsequently ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, prompting outcry and further litigation. The case is now before the Supreme Court.
The approach the lawyers at the Christian conservative Alliance Defending Freedom took in that case, known as ""judge-shopping,"" will be harder to pull off after the federal judiciary changed policy Tuesday.
The U.S. Judicial Conference approved a new policy at its biannual meeting that would ensure that any cases seeking to block state or federal policies in federal district courts would be assigned randomly from larger pools of judges.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., who had complained about the issue, welcomed the move.
""The practice of judge shopping has given MAGA-right plaintiffs the ability to hijack and circumvent our federal judiciary by targeting courts that would all but guarantee a handpicked MAGA-right judge who would rule in their favor,"" he said in a statement.
Cases like the mifepristone challenge showed how lawyers could take advantage of anomalies in how judges in the 94 federal districts are assigned cases.
While cases are assigned randomly in each district, some districts have smaller subdivisions in which, in some instances, there is only one judge to choose from. The Amarillo division where Kacsmaryk sits in the Northern District of Texas is one example.
That lawyers can sometimes pick the judges of their choosing has long been a concern, dating to at least the 1990s, but the increase in nationwide injunctions that have been issued in recent years has renewed focus on the phenomenon.
Starting during the Obama administration and continuing through the Trump and Biden administrations, it has now become a regular occurrence for an individual district court judge to freeze a nationwide policy on issues from immigration to Covid-19 vaccination mandates.
During the Biden administration, many such cases have been filed in Texas.
The Justice Department declined to comment on the new policy.
The chair of the Judicial Conference’s executive committee, Jeffrey Sutton, a judge on the Cincinnati-based 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, told reporters there were originally good reasons for having single-judge divisions.
It means local judges could preside over local cases, he said.
But when a case is a challenge to a national or statewide policy, ""the stakes of the case go beyond that small town or division,"" he said.
In that situation, ""it makes a lot more sense"" to randomly assign a judge from a larger pool, Sutton said.
The Judicial Conference said the policy ""applies to cases involving state or federal laws, rules, regulations, policies, or executive branch orders.""
Judges will receive guidance on how cases should be assigned, the conference said.
The policy would not prevent lawsuits from being filed in districts where the judicial approach of the judges as a whole tilts one way or another. For example, in the Northern District of Texas, most of the judges are Republican appointees, and their decisions are reviewed by the conservative-majority 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

2024-03-08T04:34:47.542Z,Biden turns the State of the Union into a fiery campaign stump speech: From the Politics Desk,NBC News,"Welcome to a special post-State of the Union edition of From the Politics Desk, a newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team’s latest reporting and analysis from the campaign trail, the White House and Capitol Hill.
In tonight's edition, senior national politics reporter Jonathan Allen breaks down how Joe Biden's State of the Union address felt more like a campaign stump speech. And senior national politics reporter Sahil Kapur takes you inside the House chamber for the highly anticipated event.
President Joe Biden dispensed with the pretense of rising above the political fray tonight, delivering a State of the Union address that hammered his general election rival, former President Donald Trump, and Republicans in Congress with unusual force.
“It wasn’t long ago when Republican President Ronald Reagan thundered, ‘Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!’” Biden said a few minutes into the speech, referring to the former Soviet leader and the Berlin Wall in pushing for continued U.S. aid for Ukraine. “Now, my predecessor, a former Republican president, tells Putin ‘do whatever the hell you want.’ … I think it’s outrageous; it’s dangerous, and it’s unacceptable.”
That was one of a dozen times Biden alluded to Trump, whom he beat in 2020, as his “predecessor.”
Do you have a news tip? Let us know
In what amounted to a fiery campaign stump speech in the House chamber, Biden peppered in proposals for a second term — cutting prescription drug prices, raising taxes on corporations and providing mortgage subsidies — with broadsides at his political opponents. His allies will be reassured by his energy and the combative tone of the remarks — signs of vitality that undercut caricatures of Biden, 81, as listless and disengaged.
But at a time when critics say age is catching up to him, Biden botched a couple of lines badly. In an unscripted moment, he invited Republicans to travel with him to foreign countries and included Moscow — the Russian capital from which the invasion of Ukraine was ordered — on his list. Later, as he ripped Trump for trying to sink a border security measure, he bungled the words intended to deliver a punch.
“I’m told my predecessor called Republicans in Congress and demanded they block the bill. He feels it would be a political win for me and a political loser for him,” Biden said. He was supposed to follow that up by saying it would be a win for the American people.
Instead, Biden said, “I’d be a winner — not really.”
Those two moments were brief in an address that lasted a little over an hour. Biden largely spoke with certainty and vigor, and he laid out the areas where he will contrast with Trump between now and November in ways that thrilled Democrats in the chamber.
“Four more years,” they chanted repeatedly.
In other words, there was enough there for Democrats to feel good about the man who virtually locked up their nomination Tuesday — even if he left Republicans with a little more political ammunition.
The president was 16 minutes late walking into the House chamber.
But the vibe was upbeat as they waited for him. And when he finally did arrive to give his final State of the Union address before the 2024 election, he spent several more minutes chatting up lawmakers like he had nowhere else to be.
Standing by the edge of the aisle, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., put on her red “MAGA” hat and could be seen speaking in Biden’s direction. He moved on and chatted up others, with several Democrats stopping to take selfies with him. Democrats broke out into chants of “four more years” as the Republicans stood stone-faced.
Some bipartisanship was also on display: Sen. Joe Manchin, the West Virginia Democrat, sat on the Republican side of the aisle next to Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah as the escort committee prepared to bring in the president. The two retiring centrists were greeted by Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., who is running for the Senate, with friendly smiles and handshakes.
It took about 10 more minutes for Biden to start speaking. He received the occasional shout and boo, sometimes from the guest section and other times from lawmakers. In a minor miracle, he avoided any left-wing protests over Gaza throughout the speech.
The most regular shouter was Greene, who yelled “Laken Riley!” as Biden discussed immigration. Biden called Riley “an innocent young woman who was killed by an illegal” and urged Republicans to pass the bipartisan border security bill.
Biden said they’re blocking it on orders from Trump to deny him a political win. “Unfortunately,” he said, “politics have derailed this bill so far.”
Dozens of Democratic women wore white and pins reading “Fighting for Reproductive Freedom” and (seemingly) deliberately bunched themselves into one area.
While Democrats were engaged — cheering, applauding, approvingly laughing at Biden’s jokes — Republicans appeared bored through much of his speech, many looking at their phones and some walking out early.
About an hour in, they finally applauded when Biden said the words, “Let me close with this ...”
“I know you don’t want to hear any more, Lindsey, but I got to say a few more things,” Biden said, drawing laughter from Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.
After Biden finished speaking and Johnson adjourned the House and dimmed the lights, the president held court for about half an hour before he finally exited.

2024-03-13T17:43:54.625Z,CEO of the insurance company that backed Trump bond in Carroll case defends issuing policy,NBC News,"The CEO of the Chubb insurance company on Wednesday defended providing former President Donald Trump with a $91.6 million appeal bond in the case where he was found civilly liable for defaming writer E. Jean Carroll after she accused him of rape.
Chubb CEO Evan Greenberg, in a letter to investors, customers and brokers who expressed concerns about the bond, wrote that the decision to give Trump the bond “has nothing to do with the underlying merits” of the appeal, “or with favoring any of the parties in the case.”
“As the surety, we don’t take sides,” Greenberg wrote in the letter, which was obtained by CNBC.
“It would be wrong for us to do so and we are in no way supporting the defendant,” he wrote. “We are supporting and are part of the justice system plumbing included in this case.”
“I fully realize how polarizing and emotional this case and the defendant are and how easy it would be for Chubb to just say no,′ Greenberg wrote. “However, we support the rule of law and our role in it. We considered this the right thing to do and we frankly left our own personal feelings aside.”
Greenberg was named by then-president Trump as a member of the Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations in October 2018. He continued serving on that panel under President Joe Biden until March 2023.
Chubb has been under fire since last week when Trump revealed he had obtained the appeal bond from the company.
If Trump loses his appeal of the defamation judgment, Carroll can demand payment from Chubb. But in the meantime, Carroll cannot collect on the damages awarded her in the case.
Greenberg in his letter Wednesday said that Chubb had protected itself by requiring that Trump’s bond, like any others issued by the company, is “fully collateralized.”
“If the bond is called, then Chubb takes the collateral which is intended to make us whole,” Greenberg wrote. “We hardly support or subsidize defendants or take ‘one for the team.’ ”

2024-03-08T02:51:28.044Z,Trump to get intelligence briefings despite classified documents criminal trial,NBC News,"U.S. intelligence agencies plan to provide briefings to former President Donald Trump this year if he secures the Republican presidential nomination, even though he faces federal criminal charges that he mishandled classified information after he left office.
The intelligence community is likely to adhere to past practices for nominees and has no plan to cancel the briefings if Trump becomes the GOP nominee, two sources with knowledge of the matter said. Scrapping the briefings for Trump could open President Joe Biden up to accusations of politicizing access to intelligence, one of the sources said.
Launched by President Harry Truman in 1952, intelligence briefings for presidential nominees are designed to ensure a smooth transition of power and to prepare a prospective commander in chief for office. The briefings are not required by law.
But Trump’s candidacy poses an unprecedented circumstance for intelligence officials due to his track record. During his time in the White House, Trump was accused of revealing secret information, and he was indicted on federal criminal charges for allegedly retaining a trove of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida after he left office.
Federal prosecutors say investigators found boxes of sensitive documents stored in various parts of Mar-a-Lago, including in a bathroom, a ballroom and his bedroom.
The former president, who has pleaded not guilty, faces multiple charges, including willful retention of national defense information, false statements and representations, conspiracy to obstruct justice, withholding a document or record, and corruptly concealing a document.
Trump and his lawyers have rejected the charges, arguing that he had a right to possess the documents, that he should be immune from prosecution because he removed the papers while he was president and that he is being singled out for prosecution unlike other former officeholders.
Intelligence briefings to presidential nominees focus on national security threats and are typically not as detailed as those provided to sitting presidents or presidents-elect, according to former intelligence officials. The briefings do not include classified documents or information related to intelligence sources, the former officials said.
Trump’s former national security adviser, John Bolton, said it would be a mistake to provide intelligence briefings to the former president.
“No prior presidential candidate has ever been under indictment for compromising classified information. That alone is reason to withhold intelligence briefings. There is no legitimate argument that denying the briefings would impair Trump’s campaign — he doesn’t understand what they would brief anyway,” Bolton said.
He added that if the White House does decide to provide briefings, “they should only be to Trump, alone, with no aides. That way, any leaks would by definition be from Trump himself.”
Larry Pfeiffer, a former chief of staff at the CIA and now the director of the Hayden Center for Intelligence at George Mason University, said the briefings offered to presidential candidates are “usually not as highly classified as the president’s daily briefing.”
The briefings are aimed to keep a candidate “informed enough to not say something stupid during the campaign that would upset national security issues or diplomatic issues or potentially box in a future president,” Pfeiffer said.
Former CIA Director John Brennan agreed that the information provided to nominees is limited. “I’m pretty certain my former intelligence colleagues will provide briefings that are not going to do any type of damage to sources and methods in terms of providing information to Donald Trump that he could misuse,” Brennan told MSNBC’s Nicole Wallace on Thursday.
“But they will provide analytic overviews about some of the hot spots letting Donald Trump know what the assessments are at this point,"" said Brennan, who served under President Barack Obama. ""I think it’s going to be analysis that will be devoid of the sources and methods.”
Pfeiffer said that, ideally, Trump should decline any classified briefings until his court case is resolved or if he is re-elected, but that appears unlikely.
Biden, soon after he entered office, prohibited Trump from receiving intelligence briefings that are usually offered to former presidents because of what he described as Trump’s cavalier handling of sensitive information.
Last month, Biden was accused by special counsel Robert Hur of mishandling classified information, as well. But Hur found that the evidence wasn’t strong enough to justify a prosecution.

2024-03-10T11:00:40.000Z,"After Trump ballot ruling, critics say Supreme Court is selectively invoking conservative originalist approach",NBC News,"WASHINGTON — Two years ago, conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch excoriated his conservative colleagues for ignoring history and the original understanding of the law in ruling for Oklahoma in a dispute over Native American tribal authority.
The 5-4 ruling against tribes “comes as if by oracle, without any sense of the history ... and unattached to any colorable legal authority,” Gorsuch wrote in his dissenting opinion.
His complaint sounds a lot like the chorus of criticism from legal scholars on the left and right directed at the Supreme Court’s ruling last week that said states had no authority to kick former President Donald Trump off the presidential ballot.
For critics, it was just another example of how the conservative justices appear to selectively apply the legal methodology known as originalism, which focuses on the original meaning of the law at the time it was written.
The court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, was unanimous in ruling that Section 3 of the Constitution’s 14th Amendment cannot be enforced by states, but critics were quick to point out the absence of originalist arguments.
“What struck me is how much attention was devoted to questions of original meaning in the briefing and at oral argument and how cursory and frankly unpersuasive the discussion of the history was in the published opinion,” said Evan Bernick, a professor at Northern Illinois University College of Law.
J. Michael Luttig, a conservative former federal judge once considered as a potential Supreme Court nominee, said the decision was “a textbook example of judicial activism” that contained little originalist analysis.
“This is an abomination in every respect,” he added. “That’s just one of many respects.”
The ruling itself was unsigned and none of the conservative justices — including Gorsuch — wrote separately to explain their views.
This came as a disappointment to some self-professed originalists, who believe that Section 3 as written and understood at the time is self-executing, meaning that there is no requirement that legislation be enacted for it to be applied.
The legal argument that Trump could be barred from the ballot had been promoted in part by two conservative legal scholars, William Baude and Michael Paulsen, who wrote a law review article on the subject.
“In my view, the reasoning in the opinion is a disaster,” wrote Michael Rappaport, who leads the Center for the Study of Constitutional Originalism at the University of San Diego School of Law. He added that the ruling featured a “nonoriginalist, made-up argument.”
Rappaport argued in an email that the court is not an originalist court, but rather “one that sometimes decides things based on originalism.”
Defenders of the ruling have tended to focus on the outcome, which is aimed at preventing a cascade of similar actions throwing presidential candidates off the ballot in other states, rather than the methodology.
An adherence to originalism has long been favored in conservative legal circles, and Supreme Court nominees often claim to espouse it when appearing at their Senate confirmation hearings. But the conservative justices differ on the extent to which they apply it, if at all. Gorsuch and Justice Clarence Thomas are probably the most outspoken proponents among the current justices.
“Suppose originalism does lead to a result you happen to dislike in this or that case. So what?” Gorsuch wrote in his 2019 book “A Republic if You Can Keep It.”
At a 2020 event, Thomas said he aims to ensure the law makes sense to the average American.
“I think we are obligated when we interpret the people’s Constitution to make sense of it and be plainspoken,” he said. “I don’t think it’s that complicated.”
Liberal critics of the conservative majority have long taken aim at the court for ignoring originalist arguments that might lead to liberal outcomes or selectively applying them to reach conservative results.
They point in part to the ruling in 2022 that restricted abortion rights by overturning the landmark Roe v. Wade decision and last year’s ruling that struck down affirmative action programs in college admission as examples.
In an attempt to engage with originalists, lawyers presented arguments to counter the idea that abortion rights and race-conscious policies have no historical underpinnings in the law.
In both cases, “when text and history became inconvenient, a conservative majority was willing to scuttle” long-standing precedents, said Praveen Fernandes, vice president of the liberal Constitutional Accountability Center.
The court’s 2022 ruling that expanded gun rights by finding for the first time that there is a right to bear arms outside the home has also attracted scrutiny for its analysis of the history of gun rights.
With tongue in cheek, Michael Smith, a professor at St. Mary’s University School of Law, has taken the criticism to a new level in a soon-to-be-published law review article, “Is Originalism Bulls---?”
His conclusion? “Yes. You’re welcome.”
Smith said in an interview he was hoping to draw attention to how the court can pick and choose what methodology to use in a particular case, which the justices can then say leads inevitably to a specific outcome.
“I think those proclamations are at best bulls---,” he said. “At worst, it could be an outright lie.”

2024-03-11T23:36:09.418Z,"AI gives Russia, China new tools to sow division in the U.S., undermine America's image, intel agencies say",NBC News,"Russia and China are seeking to undermine America’s image in the world and aggravate divisions in U.S. society, with artificial intelligence offering both regimes new tools to interfere in American politics and elections, according to U.S. intelligence agencies.
“Russia is contemplating how U.S. electoral outcomes in 2024 could impact Western support to Ukraine and probably will attempt to affect the elections in ways that best support its interests and goals,” the intelligence community said in its annual assessment of global threats.
“Russia’s influence actors have adapted their efforts to better hide their hand, and may use new technologies, such as generative AI, to improve their capabilities and reach into Western audiences,” according to the assessment, which was presented to the Senate Intelligence Committee on Monday.
Russia will continue to employ information warfare to try to divide Western alliances, undermine America’s global reputation and “sow domestic discord, including among voters inside the United States and U.S. partners around the world,” it said.
As for China, the regime in Beijing has adopted a more assertive covert information campaign to extend its influence and undermine America’s power, with tactics that resemble Russia’s approach, the report said.
“Beijing’s growing efforts to actively exploit perceived U.S. societal divisions using its online personas move it closer to Moscow’s playbook for influence operations,” it said. China “may attempt to influence the U.S. elections in 2024 at some level because of its desire to sideline critics of China and magnify U.S. societal divisions.”
Chinese government “actors have increased their capabilities to conduct covert influence operations and disseminate disinformation,” the assessment said. “TikTok accounts run by a PRC [People’s Republic of China] propaganda arm reportedly targeted candidates from both political parties during the U.S. midterm election cycle in 2022.”
China is now displaying a greater sophistication in its influence efforts and is experimenting with artificial intelligence software, the report said.
Asked about foreign adversaries’ using AI-enabled tools to spread disinformation before the 2024 election, FBI Director Christopher Wray said at the hearing that “AI is something that all of our most significant adversaries are taking a hard look at to enhance their efforts.”
He added: “We have seen it used in a variety of settings. Whether it’s been used specifically to target voters, I’m not sure that I could say that. But we are actively concerned about that as the latest wrinkle in a long-standing effort to engage in information warfare.”
Under questioning from Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., about the potential threat posed by TikTok, Wray acknowledged that TikTok’s U.S. branch could be directed by the Chinese government to use algorithms that could target certain political candidates in the U.S. election.
“That’s my understanding,” Wray said.
The Democratic chairman of the Intelligence Committee, Mark Warner of Virginia, warned that an array of American adversaries is churning out disinformation before elections are held in the U.S. and dozens of other countries this year.
“And I am deeply concerned that democracy, including in the United States, is under greater threat than ever from these foreign adversaries. Bad actors like Russia are particularly incentivized to interfere, given what’s at stake in Ukraine,” Warner said at the hearing.
Iran, which has forged closer ties to Russia since Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, also is expected to keep up its information operations to try to sow division in the U.S., including possibly interfering in the 2024 election, the intelligence assessment said.
“Iran will continue to conduct malign influence operations in the Middle East and in other regions, including trying to undermine U.S. political processes and amplify discord,” it said.
“Ahead of the U.S. election in 2024, Iran may attempt to conduct influence operations aimed at U.S. interests, including targeting U.S. elections, having demonstrated a willingness and capability to do so in the past,” the assessment said.

2024-03-08T18:45:35.737Z,GOP Rep. Matt Rosendale drops re-election bid in Montana,NBC News,"Rep. Matt Rosendale, R-Mont., announced Friday that he will not seek a third term, citing unspecified “false and defamatory rumors” about him and his family, as well as a death threat.
“The current attacks have made it impossible for me to focus on my work to serve you,” Rosendale said in a statement posted to X. “So, in the best interest of my family and the community, I am withdrawing from the House race and will not be seeking office.”
It’s the second surprise announcement from Rosendale in three weeks. Last month, he ended his campaign for a Senate seat less than a week after launching it. Rosendale faced a potentially brutal Republican primary in that race against aerospace entrepreneur Tim Sheehy, who is backed by former President Donald Trump and the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Trump advisers and allies had been frustrated with Rosendale, who they believed had not been sufficiently loyal, and made that clear before he entered the contest.
“This race was already going to be tough, as I was fighting against [Senate GOP Leader] Mitch McConnell and the rest of the Republican establishment in Washington,” Rosendale said when he dropped out of the Senate race Feb. 15. “But I felt like I could beat them, as the voters do not agree with them choosing who would be the next U.S. Senator from Montana.”
“However,” Rosendale added, “by my calculations, with Trump endorsing my opponent and the lack of resources, the hill was just too steep.”
In his Friday announcement, Rosendale said he made the decision to file for re-election to his House seat “at the urging of many, including several of the current candidates.”
Since then, Rosendale added, “I have been forced to have law enforcement visit my children because of a death threat against me and false and defamatory rumors against me and my family. This has taken a serious toll on me, and my family. Additionally, it has caused a serious disruption to the election of the next representative for” Montana’s 2nd Congressional District.
A crowded field had emerged for the House seat, given the expectation that Rosendale would run for Senate. Among the candidates are former Rep. Denny Rehberg, who served what was then Montana’s lone congressional district from 2001 until 2013. Rehberg announced his candidacy last month — after Rosendale ended his Senate bid.
Rosendale, a former state legislator and state auditor, represented Montana’s at-large congressional district for a term and has served the newly recreated 2nd District since last year.
Rosendale is a member of the conservative Freedom Caucus and has caused some pain for GOP leadership in the House. He was one of a handful of Republicans who denied former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., the gavel over 15 rounds of votes at the beginning of this Congress — and angered Trump by ignoring his phone call on the House floor to get in line behind McCarthy.

2024-03-13T19:31:42.643Z,How the youngest and oldest House members voted on the TikTok bill,NBC News,"WASHINGTON — Legislation that could ban TikTok in the U.S. on Wednesday passed with overwhelming support in the House, including the majority of members under 50.
An NBC News analysis reviewed the votes of every member of the House, grouped by age, and found that 78% of the 124 members under the age of 50 voted in favor of the bill and about 19% of them voted against it. Three members under 50 didn't vote and one voted present.
The first Gen-Z and youngest member of Congress, Rep. Maxwell Frost, D-Fla., was among the younger lawmakers who opposed the measure, which would call on TikTok’s China-based parent company, ByteDance, to sell it.
In a post on X ahead of the vote, Frost, 27, wrote, ""I believe the bill does set TikTok up to be banned"" and added that there are First Amendment issues in taking away a platform that more than 170 million Americans use and said it wouldn't ""fix the serious issues we have with data privacy.""
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., 34, a prolific social media user, also voted against the bill, which could result in TikTok being removed from app stores in the U.S. She argued on X that while the legislation raises ""serious antitrust and privacy questions,"" the bill was ""incredibly rushed, from committee to vote in 4 days, with little explanation.""
Ocasio-Cortez was one of only five House members under the age of 40 to vote against the bill. Most of the others voted for it, except Rep. Josh Harder, D-Calif., who didn't vote.
The No. 3 House Republican, Conference Chair Elise Stefanik, 39, wrote on X, ""This important bill is vital to protect our national security and ensure that the American people are not improperly targeted, surveilled, or influenced by a foreign adversary like Communist China through online applications like TikTok.""
And while most of the older members of the House, including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., voted in favor of the bill, some also voted against it.
House Assistant Democratic Leader James Clyburn, D-S.C., who at 83 is one of the oldest members in the lower chamber, opposed the bill.
“I got a bunch of Chinese companies in my district. They make refrigerators and all kinds of stuff,” he told NBC News.
Asked about the impact on young voters in the 2024 election, Clyburn said, “Well, that certainly is something that I think about, and I do believe that if we are going to do this, we need to do it for everybody in every way.” That includes taking a look at Section 230 of the Communications Act, which provides immunity to social media giants and other internet companies in lawsuits related to content posted online, he said.
While President Joe Biden, 81, has indicated he would sign the TikTok bill if it makes it to his desk, its path in the Senate remains murky.

2024-03-13T22:13:33.941Z,Rep. Marc Molinaro becomes first Republican to back bill protecting IVF,NBC News,"Rep. Marc Molinaro announced Wednesday that he was cosponsoring a bill protecting access to in vitro fertilization (IVF), becoming the first Republican to do so.
Molinaro, a vulnerable Republican seeking re-election, said in a statement that he is ""a parent who has personal experience with IVF"" and expressed support for ""all women and families who choose IVF to bring life in to the world.""
""Protecting it is just commonsense,"" he added.
The bill, called the Access to Family Building Act, is sponsored by Rep. Susan Wild, D-Pa. It was introduced in the House in January, before the Alabama Supreme Court's controversial February decision which ruled that fertilized embryos are people and threw the legality of IVF in the state into question.
The bill would ""prohibit the limitation of access to assisted reproductive technology, and all medical care surrounding such technology.""
Another Republican, Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida, had previously been reported to have supported the bill, but said that she was ""added to the bill without confirmation"" and that there ""are amendments that would need to take place"" for her to support it.
Also in January, Sens. Patty Murray, D-Wash., and Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., introduced a similar resolution in the upper chamber using unanimous consent, meaning that any one member could stop it from passing. The bill was blocked by Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, R-Miss., who called it ""a vast overreach that is full of poison pills.""
Molinaro has previously spoken out against Republican efforts on reproductive rights, opposing language in an appropriations bill that would have limited access to the abortion pill mifepristone.
Molinaro faces a tough re-election race this fall in his upstate New York district, which backed President Joe Biden in 2020 under its current congressional lines. He first won election to his current seat in 2022 by a margin of fewer than 5,000 votes.

2024-03-08T04:39:11.386Z,Six key takeaways from Biden's final State of the Union before the 2024 election,NBC News,"WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden delivered the final State of the Union of his first term on Thursday, a speech packed with 2024 campaign themes and contrasts he plans to highlight in the eight months before Americans decide whether to give him — or Donald Trump — four more years in the White House.
Biden comes into the speech with an exceptionally low approval rating of 37%, according to recent NBC News polling. That's lower than the approval rating of his predecessors Trump in 2020 (46%), Barack Obama in 2012 (48%), George W. Bush in 2004 (54%) and Bill Clinton in 1996 (46%) in January of their re-election bid years.
""The state of our union is strong and getting stronger,"" Biden said.
Here are six key takeaways from his speech.
Biden didn't take long to zero in on one of his central campaign themes: protecting American democracy. And he looked at Republicans in the crowd and confronted them.
""The insurrectionists were not patriots. My predecessor — and some of you here — seek to bury the truth about Jan. 6. I will not do that,"" he said. ""This is the moment to speak the truth... Here's the simple truth. You can't love your country only when you win.""
""As president, my predecessor failed the most basic presidential duty that he owes to American people: The duty to care,"" he said. ""I think that's unforgivable.""
Seeking to claim the mantle of foreign policy hawkishness, Biden also pitted President Ronald Reagan's famous ""tear down this wall"" line against Trump's recent promise to let Russia ""do whatever the hell they want"" to European countries that don't pay their dues to NATO.
""My message to President Putin, who I've known for a long time, is simple. We will not walk away. We will not bow down. I will not bow down,"" Biden said. ""In a literal sense, history is watching.""
Later, he touted his legislative achievements to make the U.S. less reliant on China. ""Frankly for all his tough talk on China, it never occurred to my predecessor to do any of that.""
""In its decision to overturn Roe v. Wade the Supreme Court majority wrote, 'Women are not without electoral or political power.' Clearly those bragging about overturning Roe v. Wade have no clue about the power of women in America,"" Biden said as several justices who wrote the Dobbs decision watched. ""If you the American people send me a Congress that supports the right to choose, I promise you, I will restore Roe v. Wade as the law of the land again.""
He took on Republicans and Trump directly, saying that ""many of you in this chamber — and my predecessor — are promising to pass a national ban on abortion"" that could amount to ""forcing survivors of rape and incest"" to carry the pregnancy to term.
What Biden didn't specify was that if Republicans hold control if either chamber, it's a lost cause. At a minimum, codifying abortion rights nationwide would require a Democratic trifecta and 50 votes to pierce the Senate’s 60-vote filibuster rule. Biden is betting heavily that a backlash to the GOP's success at overturning Roe v. Wade and attempts to restrict abortion will yield Democratic votes.
The most regular shouter was the far-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., who yelled “Laken Riley!” as Biden discussed immigration.
Riley's murder has been taken up by conservatives pushing for stricter immigration policies. The 22-year-old woman was killed while jogging at the University of Georgia last month; an undocumented immigrant has been charged with her murder.
Biden called her “an innocent young woman who was killed by an illegal” — a term generally avoided by Democrats — and told Republicans to pass the bipartisan border security bill to resolve the situation at the border. He said they’re blocking it on orders from Trump to deny him a political win.
“Unfortunately,” he said, “politics have derailed this bill so far.”
At another point, Greene yelled “liar” as Biden spoke.
Lawmakers had plenty to say, but no microphone to say it. At some points in Biden's speech, a few of them shouted their disapproval through boos. At other times, they used symbolism, and their ability to invite guests, to highlight their causes.
Democratic women wore white outfits and pins reading ""Fighting for Reproductive Freedom."" Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and other Republicans wore white ribbons that included Riley's name. The Dad Caucus wore pins with Lego blocks to symbolize “building blocks of a better future” on matters like affordable child care and paid leave.
And Rep. Troy Nehls, R-Texas, wore a T-shirt with Trump's mug shot from last summer in Atlanta — when he was booked for alleged election subversion — as a rallying cry for the ex-president.
Republicans invited families of Israeli hostages, while Democrats invited women affected by the recent Alabama IVF ruling.
The president sought to burnish his populist credentials before the audience, painting Democrats as a party on the side of the working class and Republicans as pawns of the super-rich.
“No billionaire should pay a lower tax rate than a teacher or a sanitation worker,"" Biden said, as Democrats broke out into applause and Republicans barely reacted, many of them looking bored and or staring at their phones.
He also accused Republicans of wanting to cut Social Security, which prompted a few shouts and boos.
""My friends on the other side of the aisle want to put Social Security on the chopping block,"" he said. ""If anyone here tries to cut Social Security, Medicare or raise the retirement age, I will stop you.""
He also mocked Republicans in the audience, saying he notices some of them voted against his infrastructure package but are “cheering on” the money that it brings to their districts.
“You don’t want that money in your district, just let me know,” Biden said, to laughs from his allies.
Toward the end of his speech, Biden alluded to his age: “I know it may not look like it but I’ve been around a while. When you get to be my age certain things become clearer than ever. I know the American story. Again and again, I’ve seen the contest between competing forces in the battle for the soul of our nation.”
The president, who is facing a heavy backlash from the left for supporting Israel as the death toll in Gaza rises, acknowledged their concerns.
“Israel has an added burden because Hamas hides and operates among the civilian population like cowards — under hospitals, day care centers and all the like. There’s also a fundamental responsibility, though, to protect innocent civilians in Gaza,” he said. “Thirty-thousand Palestinians have been killed, most of whom are not Hamas,” he said, adding that they’re “ministers, women and children, girls and boys,” while many more are without food or medicine. “It’s heartbreaking.”
Sitting in a kitchen, Alabama Sen. Katie Britt — a rising star in the Republican Party — delivered an intense speech hammering Democrats on immigration, abortion, crime and other issues.
She talked about how ""we are steeped in the blood of patriots"" and called Biden ""a dithering and diminished leader"" who is ""not in command.""
At one point, Britt seemed to blame Biden for the death of Laken Riley, the 22-year-old nursing student in Georgia. An undocumented immigrant has been charged with her murder, and Republicans used the tragedy in their push for stricter border policies.
“She was brutally murdered by one of the millions of illegal border crossers President Biden chose to release into our homeland,” Britt said. “As a mom I can’t quit thinking about this; this could been my daughter. It could’ve been yours.”

2024-03-13T03:07:04.341Z,"Trump clinches delegate majority for GOP nomination, NBC News projects, setting up Biden rematch",NBC News,"Former President Donald Trump has secured enough delegates to seal the Republican presidential nomination, NBC News projects, setting up a 2024 rematch with President Joe Biden, who NBC News projected earlier Tuesday night has clinched the Democratic nomination.
Trump went into Tuesday's contests in Georgia, Hawaii, Mississippi and Washington as the presumptive nominee after he vanquished all his primary opponents, while Biden faced little opposition in his primaries. Former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley ended her bid for the Republican nomination last week after she won just one state on Super Tuesday.
Trump's projected victories Tuesday night pushed him over the 1,215-delegate mark — the ""magic number"" needed for a majority at the GOP's July convention in Milwaukee. Those delegates will be bound by party rules to support him, even as he faces looming court cases in four separate indictments.
The general election starts with Biden’s favorability having dipped below 40% in a spate of recent polls, below Trump, who also remains unpopular. While Biden ran ahead of Trump in virtually every major poll in 2020, recent polls have shown the race virtually tied or with Trump holding a slight edge, with voters raising concerns about Biden's age and Trump's legal woes.
While Biden ran virtually unopposed on the Democratic side, Trump steamrolled through a Republican primary field that included a handful of prominent politicians. He won all but two contests (in Vermont and Washington, D.C.) through Tuesday and retained his grip on the Republican primary electorate in the process.
Candidates who ran against him as vocal critics — such as former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson and former Rep. Will Hurd of Texas — couldn't get traction. Those looking to brand themselves as Trump 2.0 — such as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy — couldn't break Trump's hold on the party.
His former vice president, Mike Pence, found himself unable to get out of his shadow but also unable to appeal to Trump supporters after he defied Trump's wishes and didn’t move to block the certification of the 2020 election on Jan. 6, 2021.
Haley eventually turned her campaign into a destination for the share of Republican voters who desperately want their party to change course away from Trump, but her standing among Republican voters overall fell as she stepped up the anti-Trump rhetoric.
At times, it seemed like two GOP presidential primary contests were playing out in parallel — one with Trump largely refusing to engage with the rest of the field as the heavy favorite and another featuring the rest of the field scrambling for a distant second place.
Initially, some Republicans thought Trump could be beaten. DeSantis, a popular general in the GOP culture wars who in 2022 notched the largest victory in a Florida governor's race since 1982, briefly led Trump in hypothetical one-on-one contests. DeSantis and his supporters believed that he could snatch support from Trump, particularly after Trump-backed candidates underperformed in the same 2022 midterms that DeSantis dominated.
But DeSantis' campaign stumbled out of the gate and never truly recovered his standing in the polls, in part because of early attacks from the Trump team aimed at preventing his rise. Questions about the campaign's strategy and finances emerged just months into his bid, he replaced his campaign manager over the summer, and his well-funded super PAC clashed both internally and with the campaign.
Haley's campaign started off slow, but her stock steadily rose heading into this year. Capitalizing on that momentum, the Haley campaign waited until the fall to start spending big, and she vaulted into the second tier of candidates, finishing just 2 percentage points behind DeSantis in Iowa.
Unable to garner momentum in Iowa, DeSantis suspended his campaign, elevating Haley into a one-on-one battle against Trump. But she continued to poll poorly with Republican voters, relying heavily on support from self-identified independents and Democrats in states that allowed them to participate in GOP nominating contests, a dynamic that vastly limited her ceiling even as she gave voice to many voters' discontent with Trump.
All the while, Trump didn't participate in a single GOP presidential primary debate. His campaign even called on the Republican National Committee to cancel the debates last fall.
Four indictments — over allegations from making hush-money payments to an adult film actress to mishandling of classified documents to efforts to overturn the 2020 election — and civil judgments for business fraud and defamation related to a rape allegation from an author didn’t prevent Trump from maintaining his grip on the GOP primary electorate (and they may have helped Republicans rally around him).
After his victories in Iowa and New Hampshire, then-RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel said on Fox News that she believed voters had sent a ""clear"" message that Trump would be the nominee, even though Haley was still an active candidate.
And despite those words, and her long history of supporting him, Trump called for McDaniel's resignation as leader of the party shortly afterward. Trump's preferred picks — former North Carolina GOP Chairman Michael Whatley and the former president's daughter-in-law Lara Trump — took the reins of the RNC this month as chair and co-chair, respectively, as Trump once again takes over as the Republican Party's presidential nominee and its singular standard-bearer.

The sources said they believed this was the first time a president or vice president has ever visited a clinic that provides abortion services in U.S. history.
Harris plans to tour the clinic and speak to healthcare providers, the sources said. The vice president may also talk to patients, though the sources stressed that Harris wants to make sure she doesn’t disrupt any services during her visit. She could also speak to reporters outside the clinic.
In 2013, former President Barack Obama became the first sitting president to address Planned Parenthood. But Obama delivered his remarks at a Planned Parenthood conference at a hotel in Washington, D.C. and not at one of their clinics.
Harris has emerged as a vocal and prominent advocate for abortion access for the Biden administration. She has pointedly attacked former President Donald Trump and Republicans for supporting abortion restrictions and has vowed to push for federal legislation to restore the federal right to abortions.
President Joe Biden also made the issue of reproductive healthcare for women a prominent portion of his State of the Union address last week. It was among the first major issues raised in the speech, which was a priority for the White House.
The trip will be the sixth stop in the vice president’s “Fight for Reproductive Freedoms” tour, which she kicked off in January to push for more abortion access in the wake of the overruling of Roe v. Wade.
Her office plans to release the location of the clinic closer to the time of her visit as her team has been concerned about protests, the sources said.
This is Harris’ third trip to Minnesota as vice president.
The vice president’s office did not provide a comment when reached by NBC News on Wednesday night.

2024-03-06T20:11:09.383Z,The battle is on for Nikki Haley's supporters,NBC News,"CHARLESTON, S.C. — Nikki Haley’s campaign is over, but the fight to win over her supporters has just begun.
With former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden essentially set in stone as their parties’ respective presidential nominees, the Haley voting bloc — those who previously cast ballots for Trump and those who previously cast ballots for Biden — will now have to come to terms with a choice many wished they wouldn’t have to make.
And Trump’s and Biden’s initial pitches to these voters couldn’t sound more different.
On his Truth Social platform, Trump wrote Wednesday that Haley, who was his ambassador to the United Nations, “got TROUNCED” on Super Tuesday “in record setting fashion,” adding, “Much of her money came from Radical Left Democrats, as did many of her voters, almost 50%, according to the polls.” Later, he said he “would further like to invite all of the Haley supporters to join the greatest movement in the history of our Nation.”
Biden, meanwhile, praised Haley in a statement for having the “courage” to run against Trump and for “speaking the truth” about her rival, expressing hope that the two “can find common ground” on a variety of key issues.
What’s more, a Biden campaign official told NBC News the finance teams for Biden and the Democratic National Committee have recently done outreach to Haley donors, including efforts led by Biden national co-chair Jeffrey Katzenberg, the Hollywood mogul.
“Donald Trump made it clear he doesn’t want Nikki Haley’s supporters,” Biden said in the statement. “I want to be clear: There is a place for them in my campaign.”
Haley won just two contests — those in Vermont and Washington, D.C. — in her long-shot bid to unseat Trump atop the GOP. Her coalition was bolstered by crossover voters who jumped into open primaries looking to stick it to Trump. And though they made up the minority in the GOP primary campaign, strategists on both sides acknowledged that a segment of her supporters could prove key in close battlegrounds like Pennsylvania and Michigan.
“That’s the $64,000 question, right?” said David Urban, a Republican strategist who was the architect of Trump’s winning 2016 effort in Pennsylvania, mulling over how Haley voters will break in the fall. “A third will come home for sure, a third will have to be persuaded, and a third is just never, ever, ever going to vote for Trump.”
“If you get enough of the third of those [persuadable] people back in an election like Pennsylvania and Michigan and the states that are so close,” Urban added, “I think it’s important.”
But Trump and his allies have hammered home the idea that Haley’s voter pool is so chock-full of Biden supporters that it’s not worth devoting much time to her coalition. And polling does show a significant number of her supporters either are likely to support Biden this fall or have done so previously.
NBC News exit polling on Super Tuesday showed stark divides between Trump and Haley backers on key questions. In Virginia and North Carolina, roughly half of Haley’s supporters said they approved of Biden’s job performance as president — higher than the public as a whole. On the other hand, virtually none of Trump’s backers approved of Biden’s performance.
A New York Times/Siena College poll released Saturday, which showed Trump winning a national general election match-up with Biden by 5 points, also showed nearly half of Haley’s supporters — 48% — voted for Biden in 2020, versus 31% who said they backed Trump then.
And as NBC News’ Steve Kornacki wrote, Trump’s poor performance with independent voters in early GOP primaries may be more the result of “resistance”-leaning independents’ being motivated to participate in them than a reflection of the opinions of independent voters overall.
Still, there may be a group of Haley voters now looking for a home who could prove pivotal to either candidate’s coalition — particularly voters who dislike both men or have concerns about their advanced ages.
A Haley-affiliated strategist said that while many of her Republican- or Democratic-leaning voters will come home to Trump or Biden, a solid number are persuadable voters both Trump and Biden can win over. This person also praised top Trump campaign aides Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles for building “a much stronger Trump operation” than he had in 2016 and 2020.
“I think Biden world would be foolish to think that they can run 2020 all over again,” this person said. “This is a different Trump; this is a different Trump campaign. And they deserve all the credit in the world for the race. They ran and they beat us. Conversely, it would also be silly to ignore what is a minority but still a sizable chunk of the Republican electorate who is dissatisfied with the choice.”
Over months of reporting in more than a dozen states where Haley, the former governor of South Carolina, held campaign events, NBC News spoke with many Haley supporters dejected about a possible Trump-Biden rematch — yet already sure how they would vote in that scenario.
The night before Super Tuesday, Steve Mirren, a Haley supporter in Texas, talked about his disdain for Trump’s comments from the infamous “Access Hollywood” tape in 2016 in which he suggested he could “grab” a woman “by the p----” because ""when you're a star, they let you do it."" But Mirren was more upset over Biden’s handling of the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.
David Grewe, a voter from Parker, Colorado, had the opposite take. He backed Trump in 2016 but not in 2020. “If that’s the choice I’m left with — Biden,” he said.
No one seemed particularly enthusiastic.
“I will not vote for Joe Biden, period,” said Kay Anderson, a self-described lifelong Republican and Haley supporter from Michigan who voted for Trump in the last two presidential elections.  “But I will be forced to, probably, vote for Donald Trump.”
In Franklin, New Hampshire, Ron Brooks was initially for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis but switched to Haley. Brooks said he was disturbed by Trump’s actions on Jan. 6, 2021, as he tried to overturn his loss to Biden. But Brooks is ready to vote for Trump this fall “if that’s what it comes down to.”
“I was just hoping he wouldn’t be the nominee,” Brooks said.
The Biden campaign sees Haley’s primary vote as evidence that Trump has failed to make new inroads with moderate voters since his 2020 election loss. Biden advisers point to Trump’s performance in key suburban counties in battleground Michigan, including Oakland, Washtenaw and Kent, where he fared worse in the GOP primary than he did statewide.
“Donald Trump’s primary performances present a major warning sign for the GOP,” Biden campaign spokesman James Singer said in a statement. “He is weak with the voters who are going to decide this election, while these elections show an opportunity for President Biden to expand his coalition.”
Karoline Leavitt, a Trump campaign spokesperson, didn’t offer new insights when she was asked how the campaign might reach out to Haley voters, instead saying ahead of Haley’s exit that GOP voters “have delivered resounding wins for President Trump in every single primary contest, and this race is over.”
“Our focus is now on Joe Biden and the general election,” Leavitt said.
For weeks, Haley’s team has seized on Trump’s casting out her supporters, including when he said any donors who made contributions to Haley after his victory in New Hampshire this year would be “permanently barred from the MAGA camp” — a sentiment Haley turned into campaign merchandise. At a rally in Virginia over the weekend, Trump said MAGA represents “96% and maybe 100%” of the GOP, adding, “We’re getting rid of the Romneys of the world.”
Olivia Perez-Cubas, a Haley spokesperson, said this week: “He’s pushing people out. And they’re the very people he needs to win in November.”
In an interview Tuesday with Fox News, Trump declined to say whether any peace deal with Haley could be made, saying his focus “is really, at this point, it’s on Biden.”
“The answer is I want everybody to come together,” he said. “We’re going to have a unified party because our real opponent happens to be named Biden. … I wish Nikki the best. But she stood up and many, many times said ‘I’d never run against our president.’”
In the closing days of her campaign, Haley went as far as to say she believes Trump’s legal challenges should be “dealt with” before November, that he shouldn’t be able to claim presidential immunity and that she didn’t know whether he would follow the Constitution as president. And as she left the race Wednesday, she didn’t offer him an endorsement, though she congratulated him on his wide-ranging victory.
“I have always been a conservative Republican and always supported the Republican nominee,” she said before she quoted the late U.K. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. “‘Never just follow the crowd. Always make up your own mind.’”
“It is now up to Donald Trump to earn the votes of those in our party and beyond it who did not support him, and I hope he does that,” Haley continued. “At its best, politics is about bringing people into your cause, not turning them away. And our conservative cause badly needs more people. This is now his time for choosing.”
Former Rep. Barbara Comstock, R-Va., told NBC News, though, that the Haley campaign has essentially given its supporters the “permission structure” to not vote for Trump this fall — which Comstock, a self-described “never Trump” adherent, said could spell doom for him this fall.
“This has given a big permission structure across [her base], a lot of which won’t get back [to Trump] is the bottom line,” said Comstock, who campaigned with Haley in Virginia. “It gives those of us who want to work on [Trump’s defeat] a much bigger canvas to work on.”

2024-03-11T12:28:45.640Z,"Trump says TikTok is a national security threat, Facebook is 'enemy of the people'",NBC News,"Former President Donald Trump said he believes that TikTok is a national security threat but that he couldn't support Congress’ banning the popular app because doing so would boost support for Facebook, which is the ""enemy of the people.""
Asked Monday morning whether he believes TikTok is a national security threat in an interview on CNBC’s “Squawk Box,” Trump said, “I do believe that.”
“I do believe it, and we have to very much admit we are protecting American people’s privacy and data rights,” he said.
Follow live updates as Congress votes on TikTok-related bill
Trump had initially supported efforts to ban the app in the U.S., but he recently reversed his support. Pressed about why he flipped, Trump said he could have banned TikTok during his presidency but left it up to Congress to do so.
“But as you know, I was at the point where I could have gotten it done if I wanted to. I should have said, you guys decide, you make that decision, because there are a lot of people who talk that love it,"" he said. ""There are a lot of young kids on TikTok who will go crazy without it. There are a lot of users.”
Trump then argued that banning TikTok would lead to the growth of Facebook, which he slammed as an “enemy of the people.”
“There’s a lot of good and there’s a lot of bad with TikTok. But the thing I don’t like is that without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people along with a lot of the media,"" he said.
Trump had decried Facebook as an ""enemy of the people"" in a Truth Social post last week, saying a ban on TikTok would allow Facebook and its co-founder Mark Zuckerberg to ""double their business.""
Trump’s Facebook and Instagram accounts were suspended the day after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol over inflammatory posts about the attack.
Meta, the social media giant that operates Facebook and Instagram, reinstated his accounts last year after a two-year provisional suspension.
Following his suspension from the social media platforms, Trump launched his Truth Social platform in 2022.
The bipartisan leaders of the House select committee on China, Chairman Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., and ranking member Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., have co-authored a bill that could lead to a ban of the popular app in the U.S. if it does not cut ties with its parent company, China-based ByteDance. President Joe Biden has expressed support for the bill.
The House will vote on the bill this week under suspension of the rules, Majority Leader Steve Scalise’s spokesperson, Lauren Fine, told NBC News. It will need the support of two-thirds of members on the floor to pass.
U.S. lawmakers and intelligence officials have expressed concerns that the Chinese government could use TikTok as a tool to obtain data from its users and expose them to content that could influence their views on issues such as the November presidential election. In hours of testimony before Congress last year, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew maintained that the app is safe and secure and denied that the Chinese government uses it to access U.S. user data.
Trump has courted controversial conservative influencers such as Libs of TikTok and the conservative political satire website Babylon Bee as part of his re-election campaign, hosting them at events held at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. The creator of Libs of TikTok, an account that is popular among far-right figures, Chaya Raichik, has come under fire for her posts that often discriminate against the LGBTQ community.

2024-03-08T22:10:33.175Z,President Biden supports bill that could make TikTok unavailable in the U.S.,NBC News,"WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden said Friday that he would sign a bill that could force TikTok’s Chinese owner ByteDance to divest the popular social media company or face a ban in the U.S.
""If they pass it, I’ll sign it,"" Biden said, referring to bipartisan legislation that is on track to get a vote next week in the House. The bill, called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, would need to pass the Senate as well before reaching Biden's desk.
The legislation would allow the president, via the FBI and intelligence agencies, to name certain social media apps as national security threats if they are determined to be under the control of foreign adversaries. Apps deemed a risk would be banned from U.S. app stores unless they sever ties with foreign-controlled entities within 180 days.
Members of Congress have made clear that their intention is to force ByteDance to divest the app. Both parties have raised concerns about whether China can access U.S. user data, as well as TikTok's effect on young people.
TikTok launched a lobbying campaign Thursday against the effort, sending notifications to some of its users claiming Congress is ""planning a total ban"" of the app and urging them to call their representatives. Some members of Congress, like Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., said they were inundated with calls from children and teenagers.
""We had kids, we had little children calling into our office and others basically saying questions like, 'What is Congress?  What is a congressman? Can I have my TikTok back?'""
While it is usually congressional staff members who answer phones, Rep. Ashley Hinson, R-Iowa, said she joined the effort personally.
""Well, I kind of went into mom mode, right? Because I know that TikTok has really weaponized our young people,"" Hinson said. ""They filled them with propaganda and it was very, very clear that they proved our point to us. So I took it into my own hands, got on the phone and tried to explain to our young people why we’re doing what we’re doing.""
Hinson, a co-sponsor of the bill along with Krishnamoorthi, said when she explained the legislation ""to most of these kids, and they understood what was really at stake."" They then thanked her, she said.
Despite the calls to congressional offices, the bill passed unanimously out of the Energy and Commerce Committee on Thursday, 50-0. It will go the the House floor next week under suspension of the rules, meaning it cannot be amended and it must get two-thirds support to pass.
Krishnamoorthi said that the call-in campaign “completely backfired” for TikTok and led to the unanimous committee passage. ""We can’t have a foreign-controlled social media app pushing misinformation, certainly not to our children using their geolocation targeting data in the manner that they did,"" he added.
The office of Rep. Tony Cárdenas, D-C.A., received multiple calls from a ""young individual"" claiming to be the congressman's child with an emergency, according to Enrique Gutiérrez, a spokesperson for Cárdenas.
""After multiple calls from this individual, and through other internal means we were able to determine it was a hoax,"" Gutiérrez said. ""Unfortunately, this incident happened to be during the time our office was receiving the hundreds of calls from this TikTok campaign.""
While Republican leaders in the House have signaled support for the legislation, Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., has not fully weighed in yet. He called the committee vote “impressive” and said he would have a conversation with top committee Democrats “about the way forward.""
In a statement Thursday, a TikTok spokesperson confirmed that the app sent a notification to U.S. users over the age of 18, arguing that “the government is attempting to strip 170 million Americans of their Constitutional right to free expression.”
The proponents of the effort maintain the bill is not a ban. “It’s just asking for divestment,” Hinson said. “And if everything goes as planned, then they can continue to put up their videos no matter how bad their dancing or cooking is.”

2024-03-09T03:14:15.709Z,Trump hosts hard-line Hungarian leader Viktor Orbán at Mar-a-Lago,NBC News,"Former President Donald Trump on Friday met with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán at Mar-a-Lago, drawing a swift rebuke from President Joe Biden on the campaign trail.
In a readout of the meeting, the Trump campaign said that the two “met today at Mar-a-Lago to discuss a wide range of issues affecting Hungary and the United States, including the paramount importance of strong and secure borders to protect the sovereignty of each nation.” The campaign also shared photos of the meeting.
Orbán, who has sought to turn his country into an “illiberal state” while resisting the expansion of NATO and additional aid to Ukraine, has faced criticism for efforts at undermining democracy in Hungary by weakening the judiciary and stifling independent media. He has also forged close ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Biden was sharply critical of Trump's meeting with Orbán during remarks at a campaign reception in Pennsylvania where he hammered home his message that the November election is about freedom and democracy.
“You know who he’s meeting with today and — down in Mar-a-Lago? Orbán of Hungary, who stated flatly he doesn’t think democracy works,” Biden said.
“I see a future where we defend democracy, not diminish it,” he added.
Orbán, who has been prime minister since 2010, posted videos on his Instagram account Friday where he appeared with Trump and former first lady Melania Trump at Mar-a-Lago.
A day earlier, Orbán visited the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington, for an event that was closed to the press. In a post to X after his appearance there, he wrote: “Supporting families, fighting illegal migration and standing up for the sovereignty of our nations. This is the common ground for cooperation between the conservative forces of Europe and the U.S.”
Skeptical of sending weapons to Ukraine, vehemently anti-immigrant and hostile to what he calls “woke” culture and LGBTQ rights, Orbán is a darling of many pro-Trump Republicans who see his government as a model of Christian nationalism.
Orbán “is exactly the kind of strong leader Trump has an affinity for,” Karen Donfried, who served as assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs in the Biden administration and is now a senior fellow at Harvard University’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, told NBC News.
It is highly unusual, she noted, for a visiting head of state to travel to the U.S. and meet with a political opponent of the president without also meeting top officials at the White House.
With a possible Trump victory in November, Donfried said Orbán is keen “to strengthen a relationship that already is quite good.”
Trump last month posted a clip on his Truth Social platform that featured Orbán praising him during the Hungarian leader's “State of the Nation” address and detailing a desire for Trump to return to the White House. In 2022, Trump endorsed Orbán months before he was re-elected to a fourth term.

2024-03-13T16:35:24.749Z,Trump supporter charged with firing gun during Jan. 6 attack ordered detained,NBC News,"A Donald Trump supporter charged with firing a gun outside the Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack was ordered detained by a federal judge in Chicago on Wednesday after prosecutors argued his conduct was ""mind-numbingly dangerous"" and no conditions of his release could guarantee public safety.
John Banuelos was publicly identified in an NBC News story in February 2022, but it wasn't until last month that another Jan. 6 rioter published video footage that appeared to show Banuelos firing the weapon that was seen in his waistband.
FBI special agents contacted Banuelos after he was publicly identified in 2022 to ask ""about his claims that he went inside the Capitol,"" according to a government detention memo. Banuelos denied that he went inside the Capitol before he ""hung up and then called agents making incoherent sentences saying people were trying to trick him and were messing with his mind,"" the government said.
Nearly two years later, in January 2024, the FBI then interviewed Banuelos about social media threats, but it wasn't until last month, after footage emerged appearing to show Banuelos firing off two shots outside the Capitol, that the FBI began ""monitoring Banuelos’ cellular location data,"" prosecutors said.
Judge Beth W. Jantz said during Banuelos' detention hearing in Chicago on Wednesday that the defendant's alleged actions were reckless and very serious and endangered law enforcement. Jantz ordered Banuelos detained until his next appearance on March 21 in a federal courthouse in Washington.
A federal prosecutor argued during the detention hearing that Banuelos celebrated and endorsed his conduct in social media posts since Jan. 6, and that he has untreated mental health and substance abuse issues.
In their detention memo, federal prosecutors said the FBI found a BB-gun and a starter pistol in a basement closet when they arrested Banuelos as his mother's home last week. They noted that the “recovered starter pistol appears to be different than the firearm fired on January 6, 2021,” but that even if Banuelos had used a starter pistol during the attack, that a starter pistol is still a firearm under the relevant statute.
Federal prosecutors referred to Banuelos’ conduct as “mind-numbingly dangerous” and said there were no conditions of release that could protect the community. They noted Banuelos’ extensive criminal history, including a fatal stabbing in Utah in July 2021, months after he was first identified to the FBI. (Banuelos was not charged in that case after he claimed self-defense.)
“As the mob overran officers, Banuelos climbed the scaffolding into view of other rioters, removed the firearm from his waistband, and fired two shots into the air,"" prosecutors wrote. ""This conduct is mind-numbingly dangerous. Any number of life-threatening events could have transpired, e.g., the threat of an active shooter at the Capitol on January 6 could have triggered a lethal response from law enforcement or a stampede of other rioters. Fortunately, none of these events came to pass, but the fact that no such harm ensued does nothing to mitigate the seriousness of Banuelos’s actions.""
More than 1,300 people have been charged in connection with the attack on the U.S. Capitol, and prosecutors have secured more than 950 convictions to date. While many low-level Jan. 6 defendants have been sentenced to probation, about 500 defendants have been sentenced to periods of incarceration that have ranged from a few days behind bars to 22 years in federal prison.
Banuelos is now among a small fraction of Jan. 6 defendants — roughly two dozen — who are currently being detained pre-trial due to their risk to the community or of flight.
This week, Trump vowed to ""Free the January 6 Hostages"" as one of his ""first acts as your next President"" in January 2025, equating the U.S. judicial system with terrorist organizations that engage in hostage-taking. Hours later, Trump clinched the Republican nomination for president.

2024-03-06T19:10:19.893Z,Trump allies on the Republican National Committee want to help pay his legal bills,NBC News,"A growing number of Republican National Committee members believe its campaign arm should help pay mounting legal bills for former President Donald Trump, a move that could strain the party’s ability to financially support other candidates in the 2024 election.
RNC Committeeman Solomon Yue, who is from Oregon, told CNBC he believes “more than a majority” of members are in favor of helping offset the bills from Trump’s lawyers in four pending criminal cases, and at least three other civil cases.
“I support the RNC paying President Trump’s legal bills,” Yue said.
That support by Yue and others led to the defeat Tuesday of a proposed resolution by RNC committee member Henry Barbour that would have barred the group from paying those bills once Trump becomes the presumptive GOP presidential nominee, who is a billionaire.
“The resolution is dead,” Barbour told Reuters.
He did not return CNBC’s request for comment.
Former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley dropped out of the Republican presidential nomination contest Wednesday, making it all but certain that Trump soon will collect the minimum 1,215 delegates he needs to become the party’s presumptive nominee.
When Barbour first proposed his resolution in February, Trump’s senior campaign advisor Chris LaCivita — who Trump has endorsed to become the next RNC chief operating officer — told reporters the committee would not be used to pay Trump’s legal bills.
And the RNC historically has raised money to support candidates up and down the ballot, not to pay for a candidate’s legal bills.
But that history and LaCivita’s promise might not matter given the level of support for the idea by a growing group of the RNC’s voting members.
Ronna McDaniel, who has led the RNC since 2017, plans to step down at its spring meeting in Houston on Friday.
There also might be a decision made at that meeting on whether the RNC will pay for Trump’s legal bills.
Trump’s political operation paid almost $50 million for legal fees last year, according to an NBC News analysis of Federal Election Commission filings.
Those fees are likely to be even higher this year as Trump faces more than 90 criminal counts in cases related to efforts to reverse his loss in the 2020 election to President Joe Biden, his retention of classified documents after leaving the White House, and a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election.
Trump is also trying to reverse three civil case judgments in courts in New York that have ordered him to pay nearly $550 million in damages.
The RNC, meanwhile, entered February with just $8.7 million on hand after raising around $11 million.
The party’s relatively paltry coffers could improve once Trump starts to fund-raise with the RNC.
Yue said Trump’s expected efforts to raise money for the RNC justifies the idea of the committee paying his legal fees.
Yue believes that part of the RNC’s larger fundraising efforts should be focused on helping offset Trump’s legal fees as part of his election campaign against Biden.
“Winning this lawfare is to defeat Biden’s reelection in November,” Yue said in an email to CNBC.
“The only mission of the Republican National Committee is to elect our presumptive nominee Trump as the 47th President,” Yue wrote.

2024-03-12T02:20:31.937Z,Trump asks judge to delay New York criminal trial until Supreme Court rules on presidential immunity,NBC News,"Former President Donald Trump’s attorneys are asking the judge presiding over his impending criminal trial in New York to delay the trial until after the U.S. Supreme Court issues its ruling on the scope of presidential immunity.
If granted, the 11th-hour long-shot bid filed on Thursday would delay the trial, which is scheduled to start March 25, by several weeks, if not months.
Trump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records tied to a hush-money payment to an adult film star toward the end of his 2016 campaign. While actress Stormy Daniels received the money from Trump's attorney Michael Cohen before Trump became president, Trump's payments to Cohen — and the allegedly falsified business records — came after he was in the White House.
Trump's newest filing came as a bit of a surprise — the deadline to file pretrial motions had already passed. Judge Juan Merchan released an order the next day, on Friday, pointing out the lapsed deadline and instructing lawyers to not file further motions without first seeking permission from the court, a routine process. Both filings were not made public until Monday. Merchan also gave prosecutors until Wednesday to submit a reply.
Trump's filing contends that he's immune from state prosecution based on ""official acts,"" and that some of the evidence against him should be kept out of trial because they were official acts — including his tweets and public comments.
It says prosecutors from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office want ""to offer evidence at trial concerning a fictitious so-called 'pressure campaign' by President Trump in 2018 relating to Michael Cohen.""  Part of that evidence, the filing said, is his public statements and tweets about Cohen.
Those remarks ""fell within the outer perimeter of his Presidential duty, to which communicating with the public on matters of public concern was central,” it contends.
Trump's lawyers also appeared to argue there's some sort of blurred line as to whether the business records Trump signed off on relating to the payments were an official act. They said that ""while it is clear that the People intend to offer documents and testimony relating to the period in 2017 when President Trump was in office, they have not provided sufficiently specific notice of the nature and extent of that evidence to allow President Trump or the Court to distinguish between personal and official acts.""
His lawyers said Merchan should delay the trial until after the Supreme Court issues its ruling on the scope of presidential immunity in the federal election interference case against the former president. The high court is scheduled to hear arguments in that case on April 25.
Trump tried making a similar immunity argument in the case last year when he was trying to get the matter moved to federal court, and it was firmly rejected by U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein.
“The evidence overwhelmingly suggests that the matter was a purely a personal item of the President — a cover-up of an embarrassing event. Hush money paid to an adult film star is not related to a President’s official acts,” Hellerstein wrote in his ruling.
“Falsifying business records to hide such reimbursement, and to transform the reimbursement into a business expense for Trump and income to Cohen, likewise does not relate to a presidential duty,” he added.
Trump appealed that ruling but later dropped it, making it likely the DA's office will contend the matter has already been decided and that Trump waived his right to challenge it.
In a separate filing Monday, Trump asked the judge presiding over the classified documents case in Florida to extend some filing deadlines for him, in part because of the impending New York trial. The filing did not mention that Trump was seeking to have the trial delayed.

The contingency fund would let DHS tap into funds on an as-needed basis when the number of undocumented migrants crossing the southern border tops a certain threshold that is unspecified in the budget. If the money is not used to address a surge, the money would be transferred to the general funds of Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
The request is likely to fall on deaf ears among congressional Republicans, who have already refused to fund $13.6 billion the Biden administration asked for in an emergency supplemental request aimed at responding to a record high number of migrants crossing the border.
It comes as both CBP and ICE are facing significant budget shortfalls.
NBC News first reported that ICE will have to start cutting key operations by May if Congress does not help cover a $500 million budget gap.
Acting CBP Commissioner Troy Miller said that Republicans’ blocking of border provisions of the national security supplemental bill earlier this year will put his agency in a weaker position should the number of migrants rise as the weather warms.
“I certainly continue to be cognizant that the numbers of migrants coming across the southern border could increase and probably will increase in the weeks and months ahead,” Miller said. “I think that’s one of the reasons that as we looked at the national security bill, it gave us additional authorities and resources to effectuate a consequence so that we could quickly screen off folks that didn’t have a valid asylum claim and send them back.”
Biden’s budget also asks Congress for $405 million to hire 1,300 more Border Patrol agents, funding to keep ICE’s 34,000 existing detention beds, $1 billion for aid to Central America to address the root causes of migration, and nearly $1 billion to address the backlog of over 2.4 million pending cases in U.S. immigration courts.
To combat fentanyl smuggling, the budget asks for funding to hire an additional 1,000 CBP officers who can stop the illicit drug from coming across the U.S.-Mexico border and $849 million for technology to detect fentanyl at the border.
After an NBC News report that some fentanyl detection scanners were sitting unused because of Republican opposition to funding to place them in the ground, Sen. Jon Tester, D.-Mont., asked Congress to fund the technology.
The budget also asks Congress for funds to ensure that migrant children who cross the border unaccompanied are placed with relatives and sponsors as quickly as possible.
In a statement, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said, “The President’s Budget, in combination with the Senate’s bipartisan border security legislation, is vital to meeting the needs of our workforce and the challenges we face. The President’s Budget prioritizes staying ahead of the diverse and complex threats facing the homeland and highlights our unwavering dedication to protecting the security of the American people.”

2024-03-12T01:57:59.450Z,Republican National Committee senior staffers among employees terminated after Trump takeover,NBC News,"At least four senior staffers were among the Republican National Committee employees who were terminated Monday as the Trump campaign brass more formally took the reins of the RNC, according to two sources familiar with the matter.
One of the key staffers to depart was Elliot Echols, the RNC's political director.
The RNC met in Houston last week to install a pair of new leaders selected by Trump: Chairman Michael Whatley, who previously led the North Carolina Republican Party, and Trump’s daughter-in-law Lara Trump as co-chair. Former RNC chair Ronna McDaniel agreed to step down last month after Trump formally endorsed Whatley.
Chris LaCivita, a Trump co-campaign manager, stepped into the role of chief operating officer at the RNC on Monday. He hired Sean Cairncross, who led RNC operations from 2015 to 2016, as his deputy.
LaCivita will be involved with the two merged operations from Washington, D.C., and from the campaign trail.
Cairncross sent a staffwide email Monday indicating that Whatley had directed a staffing assessment, according to a source familiar with the matter, and that some employees would be asked to resign and reapply.
According to a copy of the email obtained by NBC News, the evaluation is intended ""to ensure the building is aligned with his vision of how to win in November.""
""During this process, certain staff are being asked to resign and reapply for a position on the team,"" the email reads.
The finance and digital operations are expected to be spared, while as many as 60 RNC staffers could be affected by the terminations, the source said.

2024-03-07T15:13:41.373Z,Trump super PAC ad blasts Biden's age and abilities in opening general election TV ad,NBC News,"MAGA Inc., the super PAC backing former President Donald Trump's presidential bid, is questioning President Joe Biden's ability to serve a second term in a new TV ad, with a narrator asking if Biden can ""even survive til 2029.""
The ad begins with a video clip showing Biden pausing during a February statement at the White House before he says, ""I guess I should clear my mind here a little bit.""
The clip comes from remarks Biden gave at the White House following the death of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. The full video shows Biden speaking about comments Trump had made about letting Russia ""do whatever the hell they want"" to NATO countries that he thought weren't paying enough for defense. Biden then paused for dramatic effect, expressing exasperation with Trump.
""I guess I should clear my mind here a little bit and not say what I'm really thinking, but let me be clear: This is an outrageous thing for a president to say,"" Biden then said.
The clip in the ad cuts off the end of Biden's statement.
The ad's narrator then tells viewers, ""We can all see Joe Biden's weakness. If Biden wins, can he even survive till 2029?""
""The real question is: Can we?"" the narrator continues, before featuring a clip of Vice President Kamala Harris laughing.
In a statement, Biden campaign spokesperson Ammar Moussa told NBC News that the ad is ""a sick and deranged stunt from a broke and struggling campaign.""
Moussa added, ""Trump tried this strategy four years ago and got his a-- kicked by Joe Biden — he should tune in tonight alongside tens of millions of Americans to see why President Biden will beat him again this November.""
The ad leans into one of Biden's biggest weaknesses with voters heading into the 2024 election.
The president's age is an issue of concern to voters, polls show. In a January NBC News poll, 62% of registered voters said they had ""major concerns"" about Biden ""not having the necessary mental and physical health to be president for a second term.""
That was up slightly from November of last year, when just 59% of voters had major concerns about Biden's mental and physical health in a potential second term.
In recent weeks, Biden has pointed to the contrast with Trump to answer criticism about his age. In a recent appearance on NBC's ""Late Night with Seth Meyers,"" Biden said, ""Take a look at the other guy, he’s about as old as I am.""
He went on to criticize Trump's policies: ""It’s about how old your ideas are,"" Biden said. ""Look, I mean, this is a guy who wants to take us back.""
Regardless of who wins in November — Biden, who is 81, or Trump, who is 77 — the victor would be the oldest U.S. president ever elected.
So far, voters say they are less concerned about Trump's age. The January NBC News poll found that only 34% of voters have ""major concerns"" about Trump ""not having the necessary mental and physical health to be president for a second term.”
The TV ad began running Thursday morning nationally on MSNBC, CNN, Fox News, and Newsmax, hours before Biden will head to the Capitol to deliver his State of the Union address, and will continue running through Friday morning, according to MAGA Inc.
The group says it is spending $500,000 to air the ad.
Republicans have been saying throughout the presidential campaign that a second term for Biden could mean that Harris would succeed him, if anything were to happen to the president. Former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, who dropped out of the race Wednesday, made a line about it part of her stump speech.
Last year, asked if she would support Trump if he won the Republican nomination, Haley told Fox News, ""I would support him because I am not going to have a President Kamala Harris. We cannot afford that.""
She equivocated on whether she would back Trump toward the end of her campaign, though, telling NBC News she did not feel bound by a previous pledge to support the GOP nominee.
""Never just follow the crowd. Always make up your own mind,"" Haley said Wednesday as she ended her campaign, quoting Margaret Thatcher. ""It is now up to Donald Trump to earn the votes of those in our party and beyond it who did not support him, and I hope he does.""

2024-03-06T19:50:29.805Z,Jan. 6 rioter nicknamed 'shield grampy' admits assaulting officers at the Capitol,NBC News,"WASHINGTON — A Jan. 6 rioter online sleuths nicknamed ""Shield Grampy"" has admitted that he used a stolen police shield during the brutal battle at the lower west tunnel of the U.S. Capitol and assaulted officers with a flagpole-like object and a baton.
Anthony Mastanduno pleaded guilty to nine counts Wednesday and was ordered taken into custody by U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan, who set his sentencing for June 27. Mastanduno, 61, was arrested in August, with an FBI affidavit noting that online ""sedition hunters"" had given him his nickname ""due to his age and his use of a stolen police shield to assault MPD [Washington police] officers at the entrance to the tunnel.""
Mastanduno previously lived in Farmingdale, New York, and now lives in North Carolina.
According to an agreed-upon court filing, he ""was wearing a red baseball cap with a patch on the bill and 'Trump 2020 Keep America Great!' embroidered in white thread, a camouflage jacket, and a backpack"" on Jan. 6, 2021, and also, at times, ""donned large, clear goggles with a blast elastic strap."" He entered the Capitol about four minutes after it was first breached by a massive pack of rioters led by Michael Sparks, who jumped through a window smashed in by Proud Boy Dominic Pezzola.
Mastanduno admitted he ""was at the front of a line of rioters who overwhelmed police officers in the Crypt"" and then joined the mob outside the Capitol by the lower west terrace, where some of the most brutal violence of the day took place. Mastanduno admitted that he ""picked up and threw a blue, flagpole-like object into the mouth of the tunnel, as if throwing a javelin or spear toward the line of outnumbered police officers who were defending the Capitol against the mass of rioters.""
Minutes later, Mastanduno admitted, he ""obtained a police shield that had been stolen from the officers, which he used to push against the same line of officers at the mouth of the tunnel. While he pushed, he also utilized a telescoping baton, which can be worn on one’s hip and which expands in length, to strike at officers multiple times.""
""Shield Grampy"" pleaded guilty one day after another rioter, given the nickname ""Conan O'Riot"" because of his resemblance to former late night host Conan O'Brien, pleaded guilty to one charge.
More than 1,300 people have been charged in connection with the Jan. 6 attack, and more than 950 defendants have been convicted. Nearly 500 defendants have been sentenced to periods of incarceration, including a record-setting 22-year sentence for Proud Boy Enrique Tarrio.
Mastanduno's plea also came the day Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., endorsed Donald Trump for president in 2024, just over three years after he said there was ""no question"" that Trump was ""practically and morally responsible"" for provoking the Jan. 6 attack.
""The people who stormed this building believed they were acting on the wishes and instructions of their president,"" McConnell said after the Jan. 6 attack, calling Trump's conduct ""disgraceful,"" though he voted to acquit him in his insurrection impeachment trial.
Social media posts the FBI cited in Mastanduno's case indicate that he deeply believed Trump's lies about the 2020 presidential election.
“I hated Obama and hated his politics but still considered him my president because he won honestly,"" Mastanduno wrote. “My Trump flag [will] fly high and proud in my front yard till 1/20/2025.”

2024-03-09T12:00:41.000Z,Biden campaign releases new ad that touches on president's age,NBC News,"In its first advertisement after the State of the Union address, the Biden campaign released a new ad that bookends a list of the administration’s accomplishments with the president making lighthearted references to his age.
“Look, I’m not a young guy. That’s no secret,” Biden, 81, says in the ad. “But here’s the deal. I understand how to get things done for the American people. I led the country through the Covid crisis. Today, we have the strongest economy in the world.”
The 60-second spot that went up Saturday is the first in a six-week, $30 million ad buy announced by the campaign this week. It will air on local broadcast and cable television in critical swing states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, targeting young voters and voters of color in cities like Atlanta, Detroit, Las Vegas, Madison, Philadelphia, Phoenix and Raleigh.
The ad gives a glimpse of how the campaign aims to tackle the conversation around Biden’s age, which polling indicates is a liability in his re-election bid. An NBC News poll released last month found that 62% of voters had “major concerns” about the president’s age. Former President Donald Trump is 77.
“Y’all want to talk about age? Let’s talk about age,” campaign communications director Michael Tyler said in a statement Saturday.
“At 77, Joe Biden beat Donald Trump. At 78, he led us through the COVID crisis, put us on a path to creating nearly 15 million new jobs since the day he took office, and passed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to repair our roads and bridges and expand access to broadband internet to every community,” Tyler said. “At 79, he got us the most significant gun safety legislation in a generation and became the first president to beat Big Pharma and cap the cost of insulin at $35 for seniors.”
The final few seconds of the new ad features an outtake, when someone off camera asks the president for “one more take.”
“Look, I’m very young, energetic and handsome, what the hell am I doing this for?” Biden jokes.
The ad also aims to draw a contrast between Biden and Trump by highlighting the 2022 infrastructure law, moves to lower prescription drug prices and the president’s determination to “make Roe v. Wade the law of the land again.”
“Donald Trump believes the job of the president is to take care of Donald Trump,” Biden says in the ad. “I believe the job of the president is to fight for you, the American people, and that’s what I’m doing.”

2024-03-13T01:50:06.100Z,Judge approves Trump's $91 million bond in E. Jean Carroll case,NBC News,"A federal judge on Tuesday approved Donald Trump’s $91.63 million bond in the E. Jean Carroll case, insulating the former president from any effort to collect the judgment while he appeals the verdict.
Trump now has five days to file a copy of the approved bond with the court clerk for the Southern District of New York. After that, enforcement of the jury’s $83 million judgment against him in January will be put on hold “pending the final disposition of the appeal by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.”
Trump's lawyers filed notice this month that they would appeal the verdict.
In a filing last week, attorneys for Trump said they had secured the bond, a departure from previous requests for the judge to reduce the amount and provide more time to obtain it.
Carroll previously celebrated news of the bond, calling it a ""stupendous amount"" in a Substack post this month.
Federal Insurance Co. is the source of the bond.
A jury ruled in January that Trump must pay Carroll $83.3 million in damages for defamation. It was the second verdict in favor of Carroll against Trump. In May, he was found liable for sexually abusing and defaming her. She was awarded $5 million in damages.
The appeals process in the latest defamation case is set to get underway after Trump and his company risked another financial hit with a $464 million judgment in the New York civil fraud case. Trump is appealing that judgment, as well.

2024-03-07T21:18:43.752Z,"Rep. Ronny Jackson was demoted by Navy after scathing Pentagon review, records show",NBC News,"The Navy quietly demoted Rep. Ronny Jackson, R-Texas, after a Defense Department inspector general report found he'd engaged in “inappropriate conduct” when he was the top White House physician for Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump, records obtained by NBC News show.
Jackson, who was a rear admiral when he retired from the Navy in 2019, is now listed as a captain, his service record shows.
A spokesperson for the Navy declined to comment on Jackson's rank but said in a statement that the “substantiated allegations in the DoDIG investigation of Rear Adm (lower half) Ronny Jackson are not in keeping with the standards the Navy requires of its leaders and, as such, the Secretary of the Navy took administrative action in July 2022.”
The spokesperson would not elaborate on what the administrative action was. A current defense official and a former U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity told The Washington Post, which first reported the demotion, that it was the reduction in rank.
A spokesperson for Jackson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In a page on his congressional website, Jackson still refers to himself as ""a retired U.S. Navy Rear Admiral with nearly three decades of military service.""
Completed in 2021, the inspector general’s review found that Jackson drank alcohol, made sexual comments to subordinates and took the sedative Ambien while he was working as the White House physician. It also found he mistreated subordinates and “disparaged, belittled, bullied and humiliated them.”
Jackson pushed back against the findings, telling reporters that Democrats were “using this report to repeat and rehash untrue attacks on my integrity” because ""I have refused to turn my back on President Trump.""
Jackson was first assigned to the White House medical unit in 2006 and ascended to the top post there in the Obama administration. He also hit it off with Trump, whom he effusively praised after he gave him his physical in 2018.
“He has incredibly good genes, and it’s just the way God made him,” Jackson said then, adding he thought Trump could live to be 200 years old if he ate better.
That year, Trump nominated Jackson to head the Department of Veterans Affairs, which is when the allegations of improper conduct first became public. Jackson later withdrew his name from consideration while insisting he'd done nothing wrong.
“Unfortunately, because of how Washington works, these false allegations have become a distraction for this president and the important issue we must be addressing — how we give the best care to our nation’s heroes,” he said then.
He remained a steadfast Trump ally and was elected to the House in 2020.

2024-03-08T04:32:38.816Z,'Wake up': Biden delivers fiery State of the Union — sparring with critics and swiping at Trump,NBC News,"President Joe Biden said he wanted to use his State of the Union to “wake up"" Congress, but he was the one who seemed suddenly energized as he sparred with Republican hecklers and repeatedly criticized former President Donald Trump.
Shaking off lackluster approval ratings and his own party's anxiety about his political and physical health, the 81-year-old delivered on Thursday one of the feistiest and most political presidential addresses to Congress in recent memory.
He referenced ""my predecessor"" 13 times, not saying Trump's name once but making him a clear focus of his speech,  shouted back at firebrand Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., and sarcastically mocked Republican lawmakers.
""I know you know how to read,"" he said as he criticized the GOP over their refusal to pass the bipartisan border bill, responding to those who heckled him from the House chamber.
While Biden was unlikely to ever sway Republicans with a speech, it may help coalesce Democrats — for a moment at least — who are alternatingly panicky and dismissive of polls showing Trump leading Biden in key swing states.
Democrats in the chamber seemed thrilled. The president lingered on the floor for another 33 minutes after the speech — a record, according to NBC News — soaking up praise, even as lights began to be turned off and the House officially adjourned, aware this could be his last chance
Alabama Sen. Katie Britt, an up-and-coming 42-year-old, delivered the Republican response.
Speaking from her kitchen, Britt accused Biden of making the country more dangerous, saying the America we “know and love” may be slipping away, and said Biden is not fit for the job.
""Right now, our commander in chief is not in command. The free world deserves better than a dithering and diminished leader,"" she said.
In his own remarks, Biden targeted Trump, accusing ""my predecessor"" of supporting threats to democracy at home and abroad.
“They will not bow down. We will not bow down. I will not bow down,” Biden said of Ukraine's fight against the Russian invasion. ""History is watching. Just like history watched three years ago on Jan. 6”
Biden didn’t unveil new executive action on immigration or the southern border.
The Biden administration has been considering unilateral action for weeks that would make it harder for migrants to pass the initial screening for asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border, as NBC News has reported.
But that didn’t mean the speech wasn’t without a moment about the contentious issue of immigration.
In response to Greene heckling him, he picked up a button with the name of a University of Georgia student Laken Riley whose murder has been attributed by police to an undocumented immigrant. But he appeared to suggest that Greene and Republicans are right about crime by ""illegals"" — repeating a term that many on the left consider offensive.
“Lincoln, Lincoln Riley, an innocent young woman who was killed by an illegal, that’s right, but how many thousands of people have been killed by legals?” Biden said, confusing her first name.
Biden framed his speech around the theme of freedom — including homing in on abortion rights after the landmark Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade in 2022, which Democrats think will be a potent issue with voters.
“He’s the reason it was overturned and brags about it,"" Biden said of Trump, who appointed the conservative majority to the high court that overturned Roe.
Then he noted that some of the Republicans he was speaking to in the chamber wanted to pass a national abortion ban: ""My God, what other freedom would you take away?""
""Clearly those bragging about overturning Roe v. Wade have no clue about the power of women in America. But they found out when reproductive freedom was on the ballot and won in 2022, 2023, and they will find out again in 2024,"" Biden said. ""If Americans send me a Congress that supports the right to choose I promise you: I will restore Roe v. Wade as the law of the land again.”
Biden made a lengthy entrance to the House Chamber for the joint address, leisurely shaking hands and posing for selfies with members of Congress, Supreme Court justices, and the joint chiefs of staff.
“If I were smart, I'd go home now,” Biden joked as he took the stage, starting off light.
The route a presidential motorcade normally takes down Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House to the Capitol was lined with protesters calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. Instead, Biden took a longer route to the Capitol that avoided the demonstrations but delayed his speech. The protests have become a familiar distraction for Biden at recent public appearances, reminding him that the issue has divided parts of his base.
He announced plans to add a port in Gaza that will be used by the U.S. and partners to deliver aid. The operation will not involve U.S. boots on the ground, he said.
He called the humanitarian crisis in Gaza ""intolerable"" and said Israel has a responsibility to protect Palestinian civilians.
""Israel must do its part,"" he said, reasserting his goal for a two-state solution in the region.
With the economy the top issue on many voters minds, Biden highlighted the post-Covid economic recovery and laid out the administration’s plans to revamp the tax code, expand housing supply and reduce the federal budget deficit.
Follow live updates on the State of the Union address
The speech was also a chance for Biden to make a positive case for what he would do with another four years in the White House since Democratic rhetoric around the election so far has focused instead on stopping Trump.
In modern politics, State of the Union addresses carry less agenda-setting power than they have in the past.
But with millions expected to watch, they are nonetheless a rare opportunity for Biden to speak to some Americans who don’t follow politics closely but tune in for big moments.
""In my career, I’ve been told I’m too young,"" said Biden, who was first elected to the Senate at 30, ""And I've been told that I’m too old.""
""Whether young or old, I’ve always known what endures,"" Biden continued. ""The very idea of America: That we are all created equal and deserve to be treated equally throughout our lives.""

Pat McCrory is stepping down as national co-chair of No Labels just days after members of the independent group voted to move forward with a presidential ticket.
“I gave it my all for over a year as volunteer co-chair, but it is now time to move on,” the former Republican governor told NBC News. “I wish the best for the No Labels movement, the wonderful teammates I worked with and all those throughout the country who know that now more than ever, we must put country over party at all levels of government.”
No Labels did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday night.
The Wall Street Journal first reported McCrory’s departure.
McCrory had been listed on No Labels’ website as a national co-chair earlier on Wednesday, but his name was removed by the evening. Benjamin F. Chavis is still listed as national co-chair. Former Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., is the group's founding chairman.
No Labels has not yet announced a presidential ticket, though national convention chair Mike Rawlings said in a statement last week that the group wanted to ""move immediately to identify candidates to serve on the Unity presidential ticket.""
The organization said last week that it will announce the process for candidate selection on Thursday.
McCrory defended the organization's mission on Friday in an interview with NBC News' ""Meet the Press NOW,"" arguing that ""the two parties are failing us.""
People want ""common sense solutions to some very complex issues that are being kicked down the road,"" he said.
No Labels has noted that many voters are open to voting for an independent candidate because of the unpopular rematch between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump. However, they have been criticized by liberal-leaning groups as a possible spoiler ticket that could hand the 2024 election to Trump.
The group has rejected that argument, saying that the ""charge is being peddled by people who want to scare the public, sow doubts, and limit Americans’ choice at the ballot box.""McCrory served as governor of North Carolina from 2013 to 2017. He lost his re-election bid to Democratic opponent Roy Cooper. In 2022, McCrory lost the GOP Senate primary to Trump-backed candidate Ted Budd, who went on to win in the general election.

2024-03-08T16:16:24.547Z,"Jan. 6 rioter holding 'stop the steal' sign swung at officers with a Trump flag, FBI says",NBC News,"WASHINGTON — A man arrested on Thursday in connection with the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol assaulted law enforcement officers with a Donald Trump flag while holding a ""stop the steal"" sign, according to an FBI affidavit.
The case, along with several more arrests this week, once again underlines the motivation of the violent pro-Trump mob that attacked officers and tried to stop the peaceful transfer of power, even as Trump supporters continue to spread conspiracy theories baselessly blaming left-wing activists and federal agents.
Lance Ligocki, who had been nicknamed “Full Flag Suit"" by online sleuths because of the stars and stripes he wore that day, was arrested in Illinois on Thursday, according to court records. He faces felony charges of assaulting, resisting, or impeding officers as well as obstruction of law enforcement during a civil disorder, and other misdemeanor charges.
NBC News has reached out to a federal public defender who represented Ligocki during his initial appearance in federal court in Illinois.
Ligocki, according to an FBI affidavit, ""was observed approaching the Lower West Terrace entryway of the Capitol building and swinging a pole with a 'Trump' flag at law enforcement officers three times while carrying a 'Stop the Steal' sign.""
The FBI obtained a search warrant for Ligocki's Facebook account and obtained numerous images and a video confirming his ""attendance at and participation in protest events at and near the U.S. Capitol grounds on January 6, 2021, as well as his distinctive apparel from that day.""
One of the images cited by the FBI shows Ligocki posing at Peace Circle, where rioters first breached the restricted grounds of the U.S Capitol, and another features him posing in front of the inauguration platform.
In messages, according to the FBI, Ligocki described Jan. 6 as ""awesome"" and said they ""did breech the capital,"" misspelling both ""breach"" and ""Capitol."" He also called Trump ""a lone Wolf"" and then-Vice President Mike Pence ""a snake.""
“Everyone I seen is ready to fight,"" Ligocki wrote, according to the FBI. ""No one wants to talk anymore. I see a civil war of some sort coming.""
At the time of his arrest on Thursday, Ligocki's Facebook page featured a photo of him wearing a comically oversized ""Make America Great Again"" hat, wearing a Trump shirt, and standing in front of a truck featuring six large Trump flags as well as a flag expressing, in vulgar terms, his disagreement with President Joe Biden. The FBI affidavit features another image from his Facebook page, in which Ligocki is sitting in the passenger seat of a vehicle while holding a miniature Trump statue and wearing a hat with ""TRUMP"" written in black on the underside of the brim of an American flag hat. Ligocki appears to have worn the same hat to the Capitol on Jan. 6.
Hours after Ligocki's arrest, President Joe Biden said during his State of the Union address that Trump and some of his supporters in Congress wanted to continue to obfuscate what happened on Jan. 6.
“My predecessor and some of you here seek to bury the truth about January 6,"" Biden said. ""I will not do that. This is a moment to speak the truth and to bury the lies. Here's the simple truth: You can't love your country only when you win.""
More than 1,300 people have been arrested in connection with the Capitol attack, and more than half a dozen arrests took place on Thursday alone.
Donald Moss and James Behymer of Indiana were arrested on felony charges, accused of assaulting officers near the lower west terrace on Jan. 6. Indiana resident Annie Vo, whose son Antony Vo was convicted at trial last year and is set to be sentenced on April 10, was arrested on misdemeanor charges. Richard Staples was arrested in Alaska, with authorities saying he climbed through a broken window on Jan. 6. Ivan Todd, a Florida man, was also arrested on Jan. 6 charges. Charges were also unsealed against Jan. 6 defendants Jennifer Mitchell, John Flanagan, Sarah Flanagan and Jason Griffin, the latter of whom allegedly confessed to the FBI that he recalled being hit by pepper balls and tear gas and hearing law enforcement tell the mob to disperse before he and others breached the Capitol.
David Kuntz, an Indiana militia member who went by the name ""Reaper,"" was also arrested Thursday and charged with the felony offense of obstruction of an official proceeding, with federal authorities saying Kuntz was wearing a black tactical vest when he called out ""f--- the police!"" as rioters stormed into the Capitol. Court documents indicated that Kuntz originally planned to make ""a big stand"" on inauguration day, telling supporters they were ""going fully armed"" and that they should ""be ready to not go home if something goes down."" After Trump's infamous ""will be wild"" tweet on Dec. 19, 2020, inviting people to Washington for the Electoral College count, Kuntz shifted his focus to Jan. 6.
Earlier this week, on Wednesday, federal authorities in California arrested Kayla Reifschneider, a 27-year-old California woman who accompanied the rioter who drove a stun gun into Officer Michael Fanone's neck on Jan. 6 on their trip to Washington. Reifschneider was in the ""PATRIOTS45 MAGA Gang"" group along with that rioter, Daniel ""D.J"" Rodriguez, as well as Ed Badalian, a Jan. 6 rioter who said at his sentencing that he was ""frustrated” that officers ""did not join us in arresting the traitors"" on Jan. 6.
Several Jan. 6 defendants pleaded guilty this week, including rioters nicknamed ""Shield Grampy"" and “Conan O’Riot."" Curtis Tate, a rioter arrested in August, admitted to assaulting officers with a metal baton on Jan. 6, and Marcus Martin admitted to assaulting an officer by pushing his body onto an officer and using his body weight to pin the officer to the ground near his head.
Federal prosecutors have secured more than 950 convictions of Jan. 6 defendants, and about 500 defendants have been sentenced to periods of incarceration that have ranged from just a few days to 22 years in federal prison.

2024-03-07T21:44:54.939Z,GOP Rep. Michelle Steel rescinds her co-sponsorship of the Life at Conception Act after winning her primary,NBC News,"WASHINGTON — Rep. Michelle Steel, a two-term Republican congresswoman from a competitive Orange County-area district, announced Thursday she's withdrawing her co-sponsorship of the Life at Conception Act, saying she favors in vitro fertilization.
“I do not support federal restrictions on IVF,” Steel said on the House floor. “I’m removing myself from the bill because it could create confusion about my support for the blessings of having children through IVF. I hereby remove my name as cosponsor.”
The reversal comes two days after Steel won her primary to advance to the general election this fall, securing enough support from Republicans to move forward. Also on Tuesday, NBC News reported that Steel was voicing support for IVF even as she co-sponsored the bill, which could threaten the use of IVF for pregnancy, a process in which unused embryos can be discarded. At the time, her office didn't respond to queries about how she reconciles those stances.
The attempts at clarifying her position sparked further confusion after Steel published an opinion piece in the Orange County Register saying she’s “an ardent supporter of IVF” while adding: “I believe life begins at conception.”
Her office didn’t respond when asked if Steel believes that destroying embryos amounts to ending a life.
NBC News has not projected who her opponent will be, but veteran Derek Tran, a Democrat and consumer rights attorney, is currently leading other rivals for the second of the top two positions. He responded Thursday to Steel's shift in position by calling her a liar.
“Michelle Steel just admitted she’s been lying to every one of her constituents about her abortion-banning, IVF-restricting legislation,” Tran said in a written statement. “She can try to explain this away all she wants, but Californians see her exactly for who she is — a reproductive right-dismantling extremist who has no business representing the interests of California’s 45th District. That’s why we’re going to defeat her this November.”
Steel's about-face represents a broader dilemma for Republicans over IVF in the wake of an Alabama ruling against reproductive rights that threatened the procedure and elevated it into the national consciousness.
The congresswoman has rolled out a nonbinding resolution expressing support for the use of IVF to achieve pregnancy but has not signed on to legislation that would assure legal protections for it.
House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., who is still cosponsoring the Life At Conception Act, was asked Thursday on CBS whether he believes destroying or disposing of embryos is murder.
“It’s something that we’ve got to grapple with,” he said. “It’s a brave new world. IVF suddenly been invented, I think, in the early 70s. But there’s an estimated 8 million Americans who had been been born because of that great technology. So we support the sanctity of life of course, and we support IVF and the full access to it.”
Johnson indicated that he doesn’t see a role for Congress to protect IVF when pressed on whether discarding an embryo is the same as disposing of a child.
“I think policymakers have to determine how to handle that. We need to look at the ethics surrounding that issue, but it’s an important one,” he said. “But we do believe in the sanctity of life and if you do believe that life begins at conception, it’s a really important question to wrestle with. It’s not one Congress has dealt with and it won’t be. I think it’s a state’s issue and states will have be handling that.”

2024-03-06T18:37:22.100Z,Ohio's GOP Senate primary turns nasty as Trump's candidate tries to fend off rivals,NBC News,"CLEVELAND — Donald Trump endorsed Bernie Moreno in December, catapulting the businessman to contention in an Ohio Senate primary featuring two better-known Republicans.
But with less than two weeks until the primary, the race has turned increasingly hostile as it remains in a competitive haze.
There have been few independent polls to measure the three candidates running for the chance to unseat Democrat Sherrod Brown in what is expected to be one of the top Senate battles this fall. One internal poll from the Moreno campaign last week showed him with a double-digit lead over Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose and state Sen. Matt Dolan, but it also found roughly a quarter of likely primary voters remained undecided. Other close observers believe the primary is much tighter.
“From everything I’ve seen in both public and private polls, along with talking to folks on the ground, the Senate race looks like it’s a dead heat,” said GOP strategist Scott Guthrie, a veteran of Ohio Senate campaigns who is not aligned with any candidate here this cycle. “I’ve seen polls with each of the candidates in the lead, and everyone is within the margin of error.”
The three candidates are set to meet for their final debate Wednesday. And while a rally with Trump could help push Moreno across the finish line, a source close to the former president told NBC News that an Ohio visit is “highly unlikely” before the March 19 primary but declined to elaborate.
The vitriol in recent days has approached the level of the unrestrained nastiness seen in the state’s 2022 Republican Senate primary, won by JD Vance after a game-changing endorsement from Trump. Operatives supporting LaRose and Dolan view aggressive attacks from Moreno and his allies, as well as other developments, as evidence of a wide-open contest this year in which the Trump-backed candidate is having a tougher time making his case.
A new ad from Moreno brands both Dolan and LaRose as anti-Trump clones of Nikki Haley in a state where devotion to the former president runs deep. Moreno’s allies at the Club for Growth are on air attacking Dolan for a gas tax increase that he — and many other Republicans in the Ohio Legislature — supported five years ago.
Meanwhile, the pro-LaRose Leadership for Ohio received a late cash infusion that strategist Joel Riter said will keep the super PAC on the air through the primary. The group’s new ad includes footage from a 2019 interview in which Moreno questioned whether “you really need 100 bullets” in your gun. Moreno, who has moved to the right on several issues as he seeks elected office, now frames himself as an ardent supporter of gun rights.
Riter also shared internal Leadership for Ohio polling Wednesday that showed the three candidates essentially tied among likely primary voters, with more than 30% undecided.
“If Bernie and his team thought they were really up 10 points, I think they would have taken a much different tack the last few days,” LaRose spokesperson Rich Gorka said.
“It’s up to the candidate to close,” Gorka added, noting Moreno’s experience as a car dealer. “I know he was a good car salesman, but he’s obviously not closing with voters.”
Dolan strategist Chris Maloney took a similar swipe at Moreno.
“Inside of two weeks, his image is cratering, and his attacks don’t correlate with his inflated poll numbers,” Maloney said. “He should go back to selling cars because he’s proven incapable of selling himself.”
Asked how Moreno viewed the race, spokesperson Reagan McCarthy described it as a fight against the “RINO establishment” — using the acronym for “Republican in name only” — while emphasizing endorsements from Trump, Vance and Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio.
“If the Dolan and LaRose campaigns think they can continue smearing us with left-wing media lies, without us responding, they’re mistaken,” McCarthy said. “Ohioans are sick of RINO career politicians like LaRose and Dolan and want to send another political outsider and businessman to the U.S. Senate who will stand with President Trump, Sen. Vance and Congressman Jordan.”
Sniping among the candidates’ advisers and allies has grown especially vicious since last weekend.
When Vance on Saturday threatened on X to withhold support for legislation or projects championed by those “fighting Trump and his endorsed candidates,” without naming names, LaRose responded by highlighting Moreno’s past more-moderate views on gun control. Vance, whose friendship with LaRose has deteriorated over the course of the primary, fired back by calling attention to the secretary of state’s past support from LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, a top Democratic donor.
Gorka then mocked Vance for the “readers context” flag — “Vance has publicly called Trump an ‘idiot,’ ‘reprehensible’ and ‘noxious’” — added to his initial X post. Donald Trump Jr. and several Trump allies popular with the right online jumped into the social media fray, too. The former president’s son keyed in on LaRose’s work with No Labels, the centrist group seeking alternatives to Trump and President Joe Biden. (The next day, a top No Labels official urged support for LaRose in an email first reported by NBC News.)
“We’ve definitely touched a nerve in the Moreno campaign,” Gorka said. “And I think that what you’re seeing is exactly that. This is a very tight race.”
Jai Chabria, a Vance adviser who steered the senator's successful 2022 campaign and has advised LaRose in the past but is neutral in this year’s Senate race, found the attacks counterproductive.
“It’s incredibly stupid for operatives to attack a popular conservative U.S. senator in a Republican primary rather than their opponent,” Chabria said, referring to Vance. “They are lucky you don’t need a license to do this work, because it would be revoked.”
The campaigns and other Republican groups had spent nearly $24 million on advertising through Tuesday, according to AdImpact, an ad tracking firm.
Dolan led the way, with $8.1 million in ads, followed by Moreno at $6.5 million. Both are heavily self-funding their campaigns, while LaRose is relying on the allied Leadership for Ohio PAC, which spent $4.3 million through Tuesday and reserved another $1 million through the primary. The Moreno-aligned Club for Growth, which has begun attacking Dolan, spent $2.2 million and booked $2.8 million more.
Gorka and Maloney said they believe that ads focused on Moreno’s policy flip-flops and local news coverage of lawsuits filed against his businesses have helped keep the race close, despite Trump’s endorsement. Both also touted robust ground games and rigorous schedules. LaRose has held more than 30 events over the last two weeks, Dolan more than 25. Dolan’s campaign also has made more than 300,000 voter contacts through phone calls and visits to homes since Jan. 1, Maloney said. Moreno’s campaign, meanwhile, emphasized 70 events over two months and endorsements from nearly a dozen county GOP groups.
“There will be a lot of ads and dollars flying around in the final two weeks,” Guthrie said. “But at this point I think it’s anyone’s game.”

2024-03-11T19:09:17.507Z,"Trump floats 'cutting' retirement spending, drawing quick pushback from Biden",NBC News,"Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump opened the door Monday to “cutting” spending under Social Security and Medicare, drawing swift pushback from President Joe Biden and elevating a key policy battle in the 2024 election.
Phoning into CNBC's ""Squawk Box,"" Trump was pressed on how he plans to resolve the long-term solvency problems of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.
“So first of all, there is a lot you can do in terms of entitlements, in terms of cutting,” Trump responded. “And in terms of, also, the theft and the bad management of entitlements — tremendous bad management of entitlements — there’s tremendous amounts of things and numbers of things you can do.”
The former president didn’t get specific about how he'd change the retirement programs. A Trump campaign spokesman said he was referring only to “cutting waste and fraud,” but did not provide additional policy details on how he’d go about that or how much can be saved.
Biden’s campaign tweeted out the video and the president responded quickly: “Not on my watch.”
“If anyone tries to cut Social Security or Medicare, or raise the retirement age again, I will stop them,” Biden said during a speech Monday in New Hampshire. “This morning, Donald Trump said cuts to Social Security and Medicare are on the table again.”
Social Security is projected to be solvent through 2034. Medicare is solvent through 2028. After that, benefits under the programs will face automatic cuts unless policy changes are made to add revenue or reduce spending.
“As the President just warned in his State of the Union address, Republican officials plan to cut Medicare and Social Security,” White House spokesman Andrew Bates said, adding that “today, in his budget, President Biden honors his ironclad commitment by firmly opposing benefit cuts to Medicare and Social Security.”
Trump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement: “President Trump delivered on his promise to protect Social Security and Medicare in his first term, and President Trump will continue to strongly protect Social Security and Medicare in his second term. The only candidate who poses a threat to Social Security and Medicare is Joe Biden — whose mass invasion of countless millions of illegal aliens will, if they are allowed to stay, cause Social Security and Medicare to buckle and collapse.”
Opposition to retirement benefit cuts unifies Democrats, with progressives pushing to expand Social Security benefits as well as adding dental, vision and hearing benefits to Medicare.
Biden’s annual budget proposal, released Monday, calls for shoring up Medicare by raising taxes on incomes above $400,000, raising a 3.8% surtax on net investment income to 5% above that income threshold and directing the revenues into the hospital insurance trust fund. It also calls for putting Medicare drug savings into the trust fund to extend its duration.
The budget further calls for “protecting and strengthening” Social Security by “asking the highest-income Americans to pay their fair share,” a White House fact sheet said.
Trump has not offered a policy plan for Social Security or Medicare.
Republicans are more divided on how to address the programs, with many House GOP lawmakers supporting a budget that calls for lowering spending by raising the Social Security eligibility age and calling for partial privatization of Medicare. But Trump has sought to position himself in opposition to conservative orthodoxy on retirement spending, without getting specific on what he’d do.
On CNBC, the former president spoke broadly.
“I know that they’re going to end up weakening Social Security because the country is weak. I mean, take a look at outside of the stock market ... we’re going through hell. People are going through hell,” Trump said, adding that the middle class has “been treated very, very badly with policy.”

The hammer was discovered Friday when 33-year-old Christopher Snow was going through security at the Capitol Visitor Center, according to Capitol Police.
An officer discovered the hammer inside the man's backpack as it went through an X-ray machine, but the man ""attempted to grab the bag and became combative"" when the officer tried to look inside the bag, USCP said in a press release.
During a ""struggle,"" officers ""deployed a Taser to stop the individual and take him into custody,"" according to the press release.
“These officers did what they were trained to do and stopped this man from getting into the U.S. Capitol,” USCP Captain Andrew Pecher said in the press release. “Great work from the officer who spotted the hammer, to the officers who quickly took the suspect into custody.”
The incident took place at around 3:40 p.m.
Snow, from Canton, Ohio, is being charged with assault on a police officer, according to the USCP.
The Senate is currently in session.
The USCP has made about a dozen arrests this month so far for charges including driving under the influence, theft and unauthorized use of a vehicle, according to public arrest reports.

2024-03-11T21:08:00.605Z,House Republicans release report seeking to undermine Jan. 6 committee and star witness,NBC News,"WASHINGTON — A House committee investigating the special Jan. 6 committee released a sweeping report Monday that Republicans say demonstrates that four other White House employees did not corroborate key witness Cassidy Hutchinson’s dramatic account of former President Donald Trump's actions that day.
“None of the White House Employees corroborated Hutchinson’s sensational story about President Trump lunging for the steering wheel of the Beast. However, some witnesses did describe the President’s mood after the speech at the Ellipse,” says the 81-page report by the House Administration Committee’s oversight subcommittee, led by Rep. Barry Loudermilk, R-Ga., a section of which was obtained by NBC News in advance of its release.
Hutchinson testified under oath, privately and publicly, before the Jan. 6 panel that she had heard that Trump had lunged at the steering wheel of the presidential SUV and gotten into a physical altercation with his lead Secret Service agent after he was told he could not go to the Capitol to join his supporters after he spoke at a rally on the Ellipse on Jan. 6, 2021.
While the new GOP report says one White House employee described Trump's mood after the speech as ""irate,"" Republicans argue that ""it is highly improbable that the other White House Employees would have heard about the President’s mood in the SUV following his speech at the Ellipse but not heard the sensational story that Hutchinson claims [Tony] Ornato told her after returning to the White House on January 6.""
Since they took back the majority last year, House Republicans have been eager to relitigate the investigation and findings of the Jan. 6 committee as Trump seeks to win back the White House in November. One of the GOP's top priorities has been to discredit Hutchison, who was a top aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows in the final days of the Trump administration.
She was the star witness for the select House committee that investigated Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election and block Congress from certifying the results on Jan. 6 — actions the bipartisan panel said led to the deadly attack on the Capitol. Trump is not only facing a likely rematch with President Joe Biden this year; he also faces multiple federal felony charges for his role in Jan. 6.
Hutchinson has also written about the events in her book. Asked for comment Monday, Hutchinson's attorney, William H. Jordan, referred NBC News to a letter he sent to Loudermilk in January stating that his client has been truthful.
""Let me be clear: since Ms. Hutchinson changed counsel, she has and will continue to tell the truth. While other individuals — often men who occupied more senior roles — would not speak with the Select Committee, Ms. Hutchinson and many other witnesses courageously stepped forward. Yet she now finds herself being questioned by you and your Subcommittee regarding her testimony and on matters that may also be the subject of ongoing criminal proceedings against Mr. Trump,"" Jordan wrote to Loudermilk.
""Ms. Hutchinson will not succumb to a pressure campaign from those who seek to silence her and influence her testimony, even when done in the name of 'oversight,'"" he continued.
Members of the Jan. 6 committee — led by then-Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., and then-Vice Chair Liz Cheney, R-Wyo. — have argued that Trump's push to subvert the results of the 2020 election and remain in power shows that he is a threat to democracy and the peaceful transfer of power.
Thompson condemned the GOP report in a statement Monday, saying, “Mr. Loudermilk’s latest attack on the Select Committee’s work is dishonest."" The Jan. 6 panel's final report considered the testimony of all witnesses, Thompson said.
""All the evidence points to the same conclusion: Donald Trump wanted to join his violent mob as it marched on the Capitol and he was irate when his security detail told him he couldn’t go,"" Thompson said.
“Loudermilk is merely trying to deflect from Donald Trump’s responsibility for the violence of January 6th and his own refusal to answer the Select Committee’s questions,"" he continued.
But Loudermilk and other Republican allies have argued that the Jan. 6 panel, launched by then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., played up Hutchinson's testimony damaging to Trump and minimized or ignored testimony from other witnesses who did not corroborate her account.
According to transcripts of Jan. 6 committee interviews newly obtained by House Republicans, an unidentified witness known as “White House Employee Three” testified that Ornato, then Trump's deputy chief of staff, had said that Trump was “irate” on the drive back to the White House that day. But Loudermilk’s report says Employee Three “never testifies that President Trump lunged, grabbed, or made any aggressive movements as claimed by Hutchinson.”
Citing the transcripts, Republicans said they also found it peculiar that the Jan. 6 panel did not question the Secret Service agent driving Trump's SUV about Hutchinson's testimony until the agent's attorney broached the subject.
The driver testified to the Jan. 6 committee ""that he specifically refuted the version of events as recounted by Hutchinson,"" the report says. ""The driver of the SUV testified that he 'did not see him reach [redacted]. [President Trump] never grabbed the steering wheel. I didn’t see him, you know, lunge to try to get into the front seat at all.'""
Hutchinson also testified to the Jan. 6 panel that Meadows had told her that Trump believed his vice president, Mike Pence, “deserves” to be hanged as the president watched a crowd on TV chant “Hang Mike Pence!” Employee Three, who was with Trump that day, said he did not hear Trump say anything about the chants.
Transcripts from those witnesses, some redacted at the White House's request, will be made available to the public.
“The content of these witness transcripts makes clear why the Select Committee chose not to release these transcripts despite releasing nearly every other witness transcript,” the Loudermilk report says. “These witnesses directly undermine claims made by Hutchinson and the Select Committee and underscore that the Select Committee only showed the public what it wanted them to see.”
In the new report, Republicans also highlight corrections Hutchinson made to her testimony over the course of her various interactions with the Jan. 6 committee.
During her first transcribed interview in February 2022, Hutchinson said she did not know whether anyone had told Trump that people in the Ellipse crowd had weapons. She revised that testimony in September 2022 to say Trump had been told about the weapons.
Administration Committee Republicans also criticize Hutchinson for not testifying in her initial interviews about the alleged incident of Trump’s lunging for the steering wheel on Jan. 6.
“The Select Committee, despite knowing that Hutchinson’s testimony changed substantially over time to be more dramatic, rushed into yet another Hollywood hearing even though they were not able to verify the story,” the report says.
Hutchinson's attorney said she has gone into great detail to explain why she clarified her testimony. She was first represented by Trump-funded counsel and said that she had been pressured to be ""loyal"" to the ""boss"" and that Trump received regular reports about her testimony. Her later testimony, which included more details about Trump, came after she hired new attorneys.

2024-03-08T19:46:28.575Z,Biden leaned into reproductive freedom in his State of the Union speech — but he didn’t say the word 'abortion',NBC News,"Calls to ""Restore Roe"" and protect reproductive rights were a cornerstone of President Joe Biden's State of the Union address Thursday night, but there's one thing the speech was missing: the word ""abortion.""
Groups like the Planned Parenthood Action Fund and Reproductive Rights for All lauded Biden for highlighting reproductive rights and inviting Kate Cox, a Texas mom who was denied emergency abortion care and had to travel out of state to receive an abortion, to watch him speak.
But some supporters of abortion rights took issue with the fact that he didn't use the word ""abortion"" once, even though it was written in his prepared remarks for the evening.
""It was wonderful to see Kate Cox and her story be uplifted and, you know, condemn that she had to leave her state to get an abortion,"" Kellie Copeland, the executive director of Pro-Choice Ohio, told NBC News. ""But then to not say the word? I think it implies that it's taboo, and it's not. It was the health care that she needed. And it's the health care that many women, trans and nonbinary people have every right to.""
Jessica Mason Pieklo, the executive editor at Rewire News Group, a news organization focusing on reproductive health care, told NBC News that using the word ""abortion"" is important to help destigmatize the procedure.
""I think it was good that abortion got as much airtime in the president's speech that it did,"" Mason Pieklo said. ""But ... the need to say the word abortion from the highest ranks of a Democratic administration is important,"" he added, ""not just for optics, but because it helps tremendously in the destigmatization of abortion as a medical procedure.""
Biden, who is Catholic and has said he doesn't personally believe in abortion, has faced scrutiny from women's rights groups for shying away from the term. He didn’t say the word publicly as president until more than a year into his presidency, when Politico published the leaked Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade, according to We Testify, an abortion rights group that has been tracking how often Biden says the word “abortion” in his presidency.
Last year, he told attendees at a fundraiser in Maryland: “I’m a practicing Catholic. I’m not big on abortion. But guess what? Roe v. Wade got it right.”
One Biden administration official familiar with the president's State of the Union speech pushed back on claims that he intentionally left the word ""abortion"" out, saying it's not uncommon for Biden to deviate from prepared remarks.
They also pointed out that reproductive rights was the first domestic issue he addressed in the speech, and that he's spent a lot of his presidency focused on restoring reproductive freedom.
Emma Hernandez, the communications manager for We Testify, which connects and represents women who have had abortions across the U.S., says that Biden still doesn't use the term often enough. ""We’re seeing that when he does use the word abortion, sometimes it’s still very stigmatizing,"" she said.
Hernandez added that Biden is ""using language like 'difficult decisions' or, you know, 'a decision no one wants to make,' and that's not reflective of our experiences as people who have had abortions.""
Hernandez said that only highlighting women who seek abortions in emergency situations obscures the fact that the majority of women who get abortions do not seek them out for emergency care.
Failing to use the word abortion is also symptomatic of a broader issue, abortion rights activists say — that Biden doesn't have a clear plan to tackle abortion rights beyond calling to ""Restore Roe,"" or go back to the constitutional right to abortion outlined in the 1973 landmark Supreme Court decision Roe v. Wade.
Mason Pieklo said that Roe still left states the opportunity to restrict abortion in some ways, creating a patchwork of state-by-state care that got worse after the Supreme Court struck down Roe in 2022.
""That's the central criticism that the Biden administration continues to hear from abortion rights advocates and supporters is that 'Restore Roe' is not actually a path forward. It's a look back to a framework and a policy patchwork that failed more people than it served,"" she said.
Mason Pieklo added that her group isn't just asking for him to use the term: “We’re asking for a clear plan of action.”

2024-03-13T21:18:20.798Z,Speaker Mike Johnson is still dealing with Kevin McCarthy's baggage,NBC News,"WHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS, W.Va. — Four and a half months on the job, House Speaker Mike Johnson is still struggling with the baggage of the tumultuous Kevin McCarthy era.
The Louisiana Republican is trying to fund the government and avert a shutdown based on a budget deal McCarthy and President Joe Biden struck last year that infuriated conservative hard-liners.
Johnson inherited McCarthy’s Rules Committee, which decides how bills make it to the House floor but which McCarthy stacked with conservatives to help defuse their anger. That's forced Johnson to bypass conservatives on the committee and work with Democrats to enact must-pass legislation.
And Johnson is grappling with a Biden impeachment inquiry that was unilaterally set in motion by his predecessor — even though it appears to be losing steam.
“The former Speaker left us in a really bad spot, and Johnson has to negotiate under the set criteria of the former speaker and the leadership,” said Rep. Tim Burchett, of Tennessee, one of the eight GOP rebels who helped depose McCarthy. “And then some of those in the former speaker’s leadership group are, frankly, stabbing Johnson in the back — or in the front.”
Johnson is now gathering with his fractious and minuscule majority at the Greenbrier Resort in West Virginia, hosting his first House Republican retreat as speaker as he works through the difficult to-do list that McCarthy left for him. Given their two years of infighting and the four-hour drive to the annual confab, only about half of them came.
One nagging obstacle for Johnson is the House Rules Committee, a carry-over from the McCarthy days. The panel is typically stacked with loyal foot soldiers closely aligned with leadership since GOP members are carefully handpicked by the speaker.
But after barely winning the speakership in January 2023, McCarthy appointed a trio of conservative rabble-rousers — Reps. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Thomas Massie, R-Ky. — to the powerful panel as an olive branch to the hard right. Once McCarthy was ousted, Johnson was saddled with McCarthy’s Rules Committee, and the challenges that came with it.
The trio has enough votes on the panel to team with Democrats to block GOP legislation that they don’t find sufficiently conservative. It has meant that Johnson has often had to work around his own rules panel, bringing legislation to the floor on an expedited process known as “suspension of the rules,” and rely on Democrats to clear critical bills because of the much higher two-thirds vote threshold. But that's only created more bad blood with conservatives, especially those on the panel.
“That is a point of disagreement. That’s what we fought for, regular order. Let’s bring it through Rules Committee and let’s debate it. He’s got to get people in a room and hammer it out. The speaker’s got to use his power,” said Norman, a member of the far-right Freedom Caucus, describing Johnson's opening months as a baptism by fire. “This is fire by fire by fire.""
Rep. Garret Graves, R-La., one of McCarthy’s top allies who helped broker the deal to usher him into the speakership, defended McCarthy’s decision to install Freedom Caucus members on key committees, including rules. Involving those members in debates on the front-end prevents problems when bills hit the floor, he said.
“The reality is Freedom Caucus and others are part of our majority right now,” Graves said in an interview. “They need to be part of the process and we need to deal with their perspective and priorities at the lowest level possible.”
But even when bills have passed through the Rules Committee, Republicans have shown an unusual willingness to vote down procedural rules, effectively blocking legislation before a final vote. That's happened six times this Congress.
And it means Johnson has less leverage with a Democratic-controlled Senate and White House, as he's privately acknowledged to Republicans on more than one occasion because they know the House can’t muscle through a rule.
When Johnson acquired the gavel at the end of October, he also inherited a government that was on the brink of a shutdown three weeks later — and a band of conservative agitators that didn’t care to avert it.
McCarthy had cut a massive deal with Biden to avert a debt default that also set spending caps for the next two years with cuts conservatives complained didn’t go deep enough. And Congress had failed to pass any long-term funding bills through both chambers while he was speaker.
With little leadership experience, Johnson may not have anticipated how heavy a lift it would be to fund the government and avert a shutdown. Johnson, 52, never chaired a House committee; the last leadership job he held — GOP Conference vice chair — was so low it wasn’t even listed on the official House website.
Johnson, who declared in November he would not put another short-term funding bill (known as a ""CR"") on the floor, has since done so twice to extend funding deadlines that he set. He did so both times by going around his Rules Committee and relying equally as much on Democratic votes as he did on Republicans.
“It’s the fourth CR since he’s been speaker and the fifth CR of the year. It’s just another kick the can down the road exercise,” said Roy,  a member of the far-right Freedom Caucus whom McCarthy installed on the rules panel. “We’re buying time to negotiate a bill to spend more money and he’s not gonna get any policy wins.”
For his part, Johnson managed to pass a first tranche of funding bills last week, keeping a portion of the government afloat through the fiscal year that ends in October. Next comes the real test: passing a second tranche of spending bills — funding critical agencies like the Defense, State and Homeland Security departments — before another shutdown deadline on March 22.
Johnson’s team has argued that, under his leadership, it’s the first time since 2018 that the government has not been funded through one massive omnibus package. And they pointed to GOP wins in the first package, including cuts to the FBI, Environmental Protection Agency, and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; more money for the Drug Enforcement Administration to combat fentanyl; and a policy giving veterans easier access to firearms even if they have been deemed unable to handle their own finances.
""We are actually moving the ball forward and getting the job done. We are governing,"" Johnson said at the opening retreat news conference in West Virginia.
His allies say he's doing well with a tiny majority and inherited problems.
Rep. Brian Babin, R-Texas, who, like Johnson, had initially joined the Freedom Caucus before dropping out, said he's ""totally convinced"" that Johnson shares his right flank's goals of cutting spending but acknowledged the ""challenging job"" he has. ""I’m very sympathetic to him. I really am,"" Babin said.
Unlike his predecessor McCarthy, Johnson isn’t facing serious threats to oust him from the top job — even from those who disagree with his approach.
During a news conference last week, the former chair of the House Freedom Caucus, Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., put his arm around the speaker and shielded him from potential criticism, reminding those in the room that Johnson inherited the parameters that constrain him from negotiating more conservative budget deals.
As he fought to save his job last year, McCarthy unilaterally launched an impeachment investigation into Biden and his family’s foreign business dealings. When McCarthy was ousted from power just weeks later, the Biden impeachment was suddenly Johnson’s to deal with.
“He cocked that gun and then didn’t even have the bullets to fire it,” Burchett, the Tennessee congressman, said of McCarthy.
With the White House arguing that the inquiry was unconstitutional, Johnson made the case to reluctant rank-and-file Republicans that they needed to formalize it with a vote to enforce their subpoenas. With that argument, the former constitutional lawyer managed to get all 221 Republicans to vote yes — something of a pre-Christmas miracle.
But that’s where the unity ended on the issue. Many Republicans have grown skeptical of the effort to impeach Biden and the evidence that’s been presented so far — and that was before an FBI informant at the ""heart"" of the inquiry was charged with lying to the bureau about the Bidens. One impeachment-averse Republican even sped up his planned retirement over the dysfunction.
“We’ve taken impeachment and we’ve made it a social media issue as opposed to a constitutional concept,” Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo., told reporters on Wednesday moments after announcing that he would resign next week from Congress. “This place keeps going downhill, and I don’t need to spend more time here.”
Buck’s planned resignation, coupled with Democrat Tom Suozzi flipping a GOP seat in New York last month, has made the impeachment math virtually impossible for Johnson and the Republicans this year. They can afford to lose only two GOP defections on any vote.
Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., a Johnson ally who served with him in the House, told NBC News that if Johnson survives the funding and foreign aid battles on Capitol Hill, “He is probably the most effective speaker they’re going to have in the coming years.”
“Because since he was thrown right into the water, sink or swim — if he comes out of this thing, he’s gone through more than the last three months than most speakers deal with the whole time they’re in office.”

2024-03-13T00:40:38.293Z,"Biden secures Democratic nomination with majority of delegates, NBC News projects",NBC News,"WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden clinched the Democratic presidential nomination Tuesday, NBC News projects, winning a majority of the necessary delegates and setting up what is expected to be a bitter, closely contested rematch with Donald Trump.
The outcome had never been much in doubt. Biden faced token opposition as the party’s biggest names — Govs. Gavin Newsom of California and Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan among them — opted to sit out the race rather than challenge a sitting president who had already beaten Trump once.
By clearing the field for Biden, 81, Democrats have gambled that he remains the party’s best shot at defeating Trump one more time. The November election will help determine whether that bet pays off. Some party activists have their doubts.
""He was forced on us by the establishment, but he is manifestly not the same man that he was even three years ago, and that has made him less optimally fit for the office, if not simply unfit,"" Liano Sharon, a Democratic National Committee member from Michigan, said in an interview.
The general election campaign opens with Biden an underdog against an opponent whom historians have ranked as the worst president in the country’s history.
Biden leaned into his likely opponent in a statement Tuesday night about becoming the presumptive nominee, arguing that ""the threat Trump poses is greater than ever.""
""Donald Trump is running a campaign of resentment, revenge, and retribution that threatens the very idea of America,"" Biden said in a statement released by his campaign. ""He is glorifying dictators and pledging to become one himself on day one.""
Age remains Biden's glaring vulnerability, polling shows. His State of the Union speech last week was a chance to reassure voters about his fitness, and his performance may have quelled some of voters' misgivings. Biden delivered his 68-minute speech with unusual brio, seizing opportunities to go off script and parry Republicans who booed him throughout.
""They [the Biden campaign team] got one of the most impressive opportunities at a reset with the State of the Union,"" said Marc Morial, president of the National Urban League and a former mayor of New Orleans.
Biden's challenge now, eight months before the general election, is to energize Democratic and independent voters who largely don’t credit him for the strong economy and a string of bipartisan bills he ushered through Congress.
A thorny new political problem is the fallout from the war between Israel and Hamas. Biden’s stalwart support for Israel has divided his party. Rather than reward him with another term, some Democrats in Michigan and other battleground states are considering leaving the top of the ballot blank because of a war that has killed more than 30,000 people in Gaza.
Touting his own record has done little to revive Biden's sluggish approval ratings. Democratic allies want to see Biden attack Trump at every turn, warning that the former president poses a threat to the country’s democratic society and, at 77, is hardly an inspiring, fresh-faced alternative for voters who fear Biden is too old.
Biden seems eager to comply. He gave a preview of forthcoming attacks in his State of the Union speech. Eschewing a unifying message, he referred more than a dozen times to “my predecessor.”
“Biden has to go after Trump hammer and tong, and he has to be constant about it,” former Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., said in an interview.
Though the Democratic primary season was largely a coronation, Biden’s victory figures to be something he will savor. He has lost more presidential races than he has won. As he aged, the Oval Office seemed ever more out of reach. He ran for the party’s nomination in 1988 and again in 2008 and never made headway with rank-and-file Democratic voters.
Grieving over his son Beau’s death, he decided not to run in the 2016 campaign, having served eight years as Barack Obama’s vice president. Even if he had opted to enter that race, Obama and his political team had made it clear their preferred candidate was Hillary Clinton, not Biden.
Biden lost badly in the first few contests of the 2020 cycle before he mounted a comeback in South Carolina and revived a campaign that looked to have flatlined.
Through sheer persistence, he is now finishing a presidential term while wrapping up his second party nomination in a row. Clinton, John Kerry, Al Gore, Edward M. Kennedy and many of Biden's other peers never got as far.
“Nobody ever told me a life in politics and public service would be easy; like life, I never expected politics to be free of disappointment or heartache,” Biden wrote in his 2017 memoir, “Promise Me, Dad.” “But I have always believed it was worth the effort.”

2024-03-12T21:11:40.871Z,Why Hur’s testimony isn’t leaving either party happy: From the Politics Desk,NBC News,"Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team’s latest reporting and analysis from the campaign trail, the White House and Capitol Hill.
In today’s edition, senior national politics reporter Alex Seitz-Wald explains why neither party got what it wanted from former Special Counsel Robert Hur's testimony. Plus, national political correspondent Steve Kornacki breaks down whether the Joe Biden-Donald Trump rematch will be the longest general election campaign ever.
In an election that is testing the political independence of the judiciary like never before, with one candidate facing prosecution overseen by his rival’s Department of Justice, former special counsel Robert Hur’s congressional testimony today showed how precarious it can be to try to enforce the law without appearing partisan.
Hur’s report last month delved into some of the critical questions of the 2024 election, including President Joe Biden’s mental faculties and former President Donald Trump’s alleged crimes. But during his roughly four-hour appearance before the House Judiciary Committee, Hur himself seemed to have no interest in answering those questions beyond the narrow scope of his probe. His testimony often felt more like a book report on his investigation into Biden’s handling of classified documents.
Do you have a news tip? Let us know
Going into the hearing, Republicans were hoping for some bombshell revelations to revive their Biden impeachment effort, which appears to have stalled out after their star witness was arrested for allegedly lying about his claims.
But Republicans did not get what they wanted. Hur offered no new evidence against the president, despite GOP fishing attempts for dirt on Biden’s alleged “influence peddling.”
Democrats, meanwhile, have spent the past several weeks crowing about the fact that Hur decided against charging Biden, while also lambasting him for what they say were gratuitous and inaccurate comments about Biden’s faulty memory. Hur is a Republican who was appointed by Trump to be a U.S. attorney, some liberals have noted.
But Democrats also did not get what they wanted from the hearing.
Hur explained that his understanding of Biden’s “state of mind” was not a side question, but a critical part of his job. “My task was to determine whether the president retained or disclosed national defense information ‘willfully’ — meaning, knowingly and with the intent to do something the law forbids,” he said. And he affirmed hearing memory lapses.
And transcripts of Hur’s two-day interview with Biden, released just before the hearing started, show several examples of the president struggling to remember a date or name, but also did not confirm some Republicans’ wilder claims about Biden’s alleged cognitive decline.
Nor did Hur fully exonerate Biden on the classified documents question, as some Democrats have claimed. In fact, Hur noted, he concluded that Biden did willfully mishandle classified material, but that he was unlikely to secure a jury conviction based on the evidence, so charges were not advised.
But “not-guilty-but-not-quite-innocent” doesn’t fit on a bumper sticker or a hashtag, and neither does Hur’s more nuanced take on Biden’s memory.
In the end, both parties will inevitably salvage something from the hearing to use in the campaign, but no one really got what they wanted — except perhaps for Hur, whose restrained testimony will likely be studied by other presidential prosecutors who will inevitably be asked to testify before Congress.
With perhaps the most suspense-free primary season in history winding down, it sure feels like the 2024 general election campaign will be the longest ever. And by one metric it could well be — but just barely.
That’s because today’s primaries and caucuses in Georgia, Hawaii, Mississippi and Washington state are set to give both Biden and Trump enough delegates to reach the magic number needed to clinch their parties’ nominations.
Biden, now just 99 delegates short of the mark, figures to do so early — probably in the 7 p.m. ET hour, when polls close in Georgia. For Trump, it will take a bit longer. Potentially, he could do it once Washington’s polls close at 11 p.m. ET. If that happens, then today, March 12, will be the day that both candidates clinch. And that would then leave 240 days until the Nov. 5 election, which would indeed set 2024 up to feature the longest general election campaign in the modern era.
But vote tabulations and delegate allocations can sometimes take a while, so it’s possible Trump won’t clear the number until after midnight, and maybe not even until Hawaii’s results come in around 2 a.m. ET. Under this scenario, it would technically be tomorrow that both candidates clinch, which would leave 239 days until Nov. 5. And that would tie the record set in both the 2004 election between George W. Bush and John Kerry, and the 2000 election between Bush and Al Gore.
Of course, this is just one metric to measure the length of a campaign, and it has its flaws. Four years ago, for instance, Biden crossed the Democrats’ delegate threshold on June 6. But that was a mere formality; Bernie Sanders had dropped out two months earlier and Biden had long since shifted his attention to Trump. So for all intents and purposes, the 2020 general election campaign was a lot longer than the 151 days shown above.
On the other end of the scale, there’s 1980, when Jimmy Carter obtained the needed delegates on June 3. But his Democratic primary opponent, Ted Kennedy, battled all the way until the August convention, pursuing a rules change that would free delegates from their existing commitments and allow them to vote for him instead. (The effort failed, of course.) It could be argued, then, that the Carter-Ronald Reagan campaign was much shorter than 155 days.
Similarly subjective issues arise in other election years too, including the current one. While the formal delegate thresholds will be met tonight or early in the morning, media outlets already declared Trump the presumptive Republican nominee last week after Nikki Haley dropped out.
Was that the real start of the general election? Or was it even earlier than that? Even as Haley continued to campaign after Trump’s Iowa and New Hampshire victories, it was taken as a given that he’d be the GOP nominee, and the Trump and Biden teams were already aiming their fire at each other.
Ultimately, calculating the precise length of a campaign is an art, not a science.

2024-03-08T04:59:53.694Z,Ala. Sen. Katie Britt paints an America in despair in State of the Union response,NBC News,"WASHINGTON — Alabama freshman Sen. Katie Britt gave the Republican response to President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address, lambasting the Democratic leader over a border crisis she said he “invited,” reckless spending, and a country she said was more dangerous than it was four years ago.
In a dark turn, Britt appeared to blame Biden for the murder of Laken Riley, the 22-year-old nursing student whom the president earlier said was murdered by an “illegal” during an unscripted moment of his speech.
“She was brutally murdered by one of the millions of illegal border crossers President Biden chose to release into our homeland,” Britt said. “As a mom, I can't quit thinking about this; this could been my daughter. It could’ve been yours.”
Britt also blamed the president for an economy she said was squeezing Americans' pocketbooks, with people ""who did everything right"" going hungry. She accused Biden of failing to adequately respond to the threat from China, and of using TikTok for his campaign — even as the president banned it for government employees. “Y’all, you can’t make this stuff up,” she said.
Britt at times seemed to mimic the president, lowering her voice to a whisper.
Biden did not invoke Trump directly in his remarks, and instead referred to a “former Republican president,” and his “predecessor.” Neither did Britt.
Britt was expected to sound an optimistic note in her remarks, harking back to Ronald Reagan's declaration of American exceptionalism in his 'Shining City on a Hill' speech. Instead, Britt, at home in her kitchen, painted a darker picture, invoking Reagan’s famed question from a presidential debate against Democrat Jimmy Carter, “Just ask yourself, are you better off now than you were three years ago?”
Britt declared Biden “a dithering and diminished leader” who is “not in command” — moments after the president delivered an energetic address to Congress and the nation that saw him parry with Republicans in the audience. Biden was still at the Capitol after Britt had ended her remarks.
A rising conservative star, Britt took the task of delivering the response against the backdrop of a presidential election fight that is setting up to be waged by party leaders whose combined age is nearly four times her own.
She became the youngest Republican woman to be elected to the Senate and the first to represent Alabama when she was sworn in last year after garnering former President Donald Trump’s endorsement. She is a staunch conservative who has made immigration a top issue.
Now with Biden facing increasing skepticism over his age, Britt, 42, worked to sharpen this contrast after the president delivered his third State of the Union address on Thursday evening.
Republicans have sought to emphasize the obstacle for Democrats: In an advertisement that began airing Thursday, the super PAC supporting Trump questioned whether Biden “could even survive” a second term.
At the same time, Britt — with her husband, former NFL player Wesley Britt — is known for her close friendship with Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., and his wife, Gisele, a pairing that showcases how Americans on opposite sides of the aisle can look beyond their partisan differences.
Britt, in her address, made an argument that the Republican Party is the party of family, sharing her perspective on kitchen table issues as a mother of two.
“Sen. Britt doesn’t have to talk abstractly or even think abstractly about how policies are affecting American families,” a source familiar with Britt’s remarks said. “She’s living through it.”
At the same time, the senator made an impassioned plea for parents “to get into the arena,” a tacit acknowledgment of the women voters who have trended away from the Republican Party in elections following Trump’s 2016 win.
Britt argued that “the country we know and love seems to be slipping away.”
“It feels like the next generation will have fewer opportunities — and less freedom — than we did,” Britt said, sounding pained. “I worry my own children may not even get a shot at living their American Dreams.”
“The true, unvarnished State of our Union begins and ends with this: Our families are hurting. Our country can do better,” she said.
Britt argued that the country has been made more dangerous by Democrats who have “coddled criminals” and defunded the police. Punishing families are “sky-high” childcare costs and mortgage rates.
“The American people are scraping by while the President proudly proclaims Bidenomics is working! Goodness y'all, bless his heart,” she said. “We know better.”
In one of several references to Biden’s advanced age, Britt lambasted the president as “a permanent politician” who has spent more years in office “than I’ve even been alive.”
Central to Britt’s case is that voters are not being heard by Biden and Democrats. “Frankly, a large part of our message is going to be that the president’s out of touch,” the source said.
The Alabama senator is being elevated as voters have expressed deep dissatisfaction with the choices they are being offered.
A New York Times/Siena College poll published over the weekend showed a majority of voters hold an unfavorable view of both Biden and Trump, with even those who supported the 81-year-old president in 2020 responding that he is “just too old” to be effective.
In announcing that Britt would give the party response, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., called the senator “an unapologetic optimist.”
The sentiment was among the reasons House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., gave to Britt about why he believed she should be the one to deliver the speech, a source familiar with the conversation said.
“I do remember the speaker saying, ‘Look, I think we need the kind of 'shining city on a hill' Reaganesque Republican … that person who can bring not only strength but optimism for the future. And you’re somebody who I think can deliver that message,’” the source said.
Her address comes as Republicans continue to struggle with female voters in suburbs and highly educated enclaves, who have trended away from the party following Trump’s election.
“Republicans are elevating someone who looks and sounds like the demographic that they know Trump is struggling with,” said Karen Finney, a top adviser to Hillary Clinton during her 2016 presidential campaign. “They know they have trouble with women.”
Britt’s address comes as statewide ballot questions on abortion have yielded victories for abortion rights advocates in Republican-leaning states, and as efforts are underway to get protections on the ballot in 2024 in at least a dozen more.
Britt has taken on a leadership role with Republicans behind the scenes, arguing that there is a path to talking about in vitro fertilization, the source familiar with her remarks said.
When a Supreme Court ruling in Alabama threatened fertility clinics in the state, Britt made the case to Trump that a truly pro-family stance should embrace IVF, a source familiar with the conversation confirmed. The decision in Alabama ruled that embryos created during the process of in vitro fertilization can be considered children under state law, raising questions about what destroying them could mean. Biden, early in his address, called on Congress to protect access to invitro fertilization, bringing Democrats to their feet.
Trump has evaded staking out positions on the most contentious fights over reproductive rights. But soon after the call, Trump issued a post-ruling statement advising that he would “strongly support the availability of IVF” and urging the Alabama Legislature to find an immediate solution to preserve its access.
She addressed her support for it in her response, a source said.
Before her speech, allies of the president noted Britt’s ascent.
“She’s a rock star,” a Democratic strategist said. “She could very well could be the face of the post-Trump GOP. And maybe our first woman president in 2028.”
“She’s an incredible politician and could win a lot of suburban women in a huge way,” the strategist added.

2024-03-12T16:46:45.341Z,Hungary's leader claims Trump told him he would cut off U.S. military aid to Ukraine,NBC News,"Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán said in a new interview that former President Donald Trump told him he would cut off U.S. military aid to Ukraine in an effort to end its conflict with Russia.
Orbán said in an interview with a state-run media organization in Hungary, M1, published overnight, that Trump's plan is to ""not give a penny"" to Ukraine, stating that the country ""cannot stand on its own feet."" The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment for over 24 hours.
“He has a very clear vision that is hard to disagree with. He says the following: First of all, he will not give a penny in the Ukrainian-Russian war. That is why the war will end, because it is obvious that Ukraine cannot stand on its own feet,"" Orbán said. ""If the Americans don’t give money and weapons, along with the Europeans, then the war is over. And if the Americans don’t give money, the Europeans alone are unable to finance this war. And then the war is over.”
Trump, who has repeatedly asserted that the conflict would never have happened under his watch, suggested in the past that he is not in favor of helping Ukraine defend itself against Russia. In February, for example, Trump said, without specifically naming Ukraine, ""No money in the form of foreign aid should be given to any country unless it is done as a loan.""
Orbán visited Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate Friday. Trump told those gathered at his club in Palm Beach, Florida, that there is “nobody that’s better, smarter or a better leader than Viktor Orbán.”
As Hungary's leader, Orbán has largely been critical of providing aid, including weapons, to Ukraine, and he has resisted the expansion of NATO. However, Hungary dropped its opposition this year to allowing the European Union to use its budget to give Ukraine a $54 aid package. Orbán, like Trump, also has a history of floating conspiracy theories.
Meanwhile, the Biden administration has been waiting for Congress to approve legislation to provide additional aid to Ukraine. House Republican leaders have so far decided not to bring such a measure to the floor for a vote, though last week NBC News reported Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and the chairmen of key House committees dealing with national security are working to develop their own Ukraine aid package.

2024-03-14T12:59:15.900Z,Bernie Sanders pushes bill to establish a four-day workweek,NBC News,"Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., will hold a hearing Thursday on a bill he introduced to reduce the standard U.S. workweek to four days without loss of pay.
The bill, titled the “Thirty-Two Hour Work Week Act,” would reduce the standard workweek from 40 to 32 hours over the span of four years, including lowering the maximum hours required for overtime compensation for nonexempt employees. It would also require overtime pay at time and a half for workdays that last more than eight hours and overtime pay that would pay workers double their regular pay if their workday is longer than 12 hours.
A press release on the bill described it as an “important step toward ensuring workers share in increasing productivity and economic growth driven by technological advancements.”
“Moving to a 32-hour workweek with no loss of pay is not a radical idea,” Sanders said in a statement. “Today, American workers are over 400 percent more productive than they were in the 1940s. And yet, millions of Americans are working longer hours for lower wages than they were decades ago. That has got to change.”
“The financial gains from the major advancements in artificial intelligence, automation and new technology must benefit the working class, not just corporate CEOs and wealthy stockholders on Wall Street,” he said. “It is time to reduce the stress level in our country and allow Americans to enjoy a better quality of life. It is time for a 32-hour workweek with no loss in pay. I look forward to the discussion this week.”
Sanders introduced the legislation with Sen. Laphonza Butler, D-Calif.; Rep. Mark Takano, D-Calif., introduced companion legislation in the House.
Sanders, who chairs the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, has asked United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain, Boston College sociology professor Juliet Schor and Jon Leland, chief strategy officer of Kickstarter and cofounder of the Four Day Workweek Campaign, to testify at the hearing on the proposal.
In a news release on the bill, Sanders cites studies that say that although weekly wages for average American workers are lower than they were 50 years ago after adjusting for inflation, CEOs make hundreds of times more than what their workers earn.
“It’s time that working families— not just CEOs and wealthy shareholders — are able to benefit from increased productivity so that they can enjoy more leisure time, family time, education and cultural opportunities, and less stress,” the fact sheet says.
Sanders also pointed to other countries that have reduced their workweeks, such as France, Norway and Denmark, as well as four-day workweek pilot programs that found increased productivity and satisfaction among workers.

2024-03-12T16:52:33.699Z,Trump's newfound opposition to a TikTok ban isn't swaying Republicans,NBC News,"WASHINGTON — Former President Trump reversed course and now opposes a ban on social media giant TikTok. But his new stance — and a full-court press from TikTok and its millions of users — isn’t swaying his fellow Republicans on Capitol Hill.
House GOP leaders are charging ahead with a vote Wednesday on legislation that would ban TikTok from U.S. app stores unless its parent company, China-based ByteDance, agrees to divest the popular video-based video app.
And even some of Trump’s conservative allies in Congress said they have no problem calling out their party's presumptive nominee for president over his newfound position on TikTok.
“Well, he’s wrong. And by the way, he had his own executive orders and his own actions he was doing, and now … he’s suddenly flipped around on that,” said Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, a member of the far-right Freedom Caucus. ""I mean, it’s not the first or last time that I’ll disagree with the former president. The TikTok issue is pretty straightforward.”
“I have respect and admiration for President Trump,” added Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., another Trump backer. “Nobody controls how I vote on certain issues.”
The Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act — co-authored by the leaders of the select committee investigating the Chinese Communist Party, Reps. Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., and Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill. — received a  boost of momentum last week when it cleared the Energy and Commerce Committee on a rare 50-0 vote. President Joe Biden has endorsed the bill.
""TikTok will have to make a choice as to whether or not they stay connected to ByteDance and ultimately controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, or if they choose to sell and operate in the United States,"" said Energy and Commerce Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., who shepherded the bill through her committee.
It’s expected to sail through the House on Wednesday, though it faces a more uncertain road in the Senate, where leaders say they are still evaluating the legislation.
FBI Director Christopher Wray, and lawmakers in both parties, say they view TikTok as a national security threat. Specifically, they are concerned that the Chinese government could use TikTok to access personal data from its more than 150 million users and use algorithms to show them videos that could influence their views on issues, including the upcoming presidential election.
This bill is “divestment from the Communist Party of China; it’s pretty simple,” said Diaz-Balart, whose family fled Cuba after Fidel Castro’s takeover. “We would have never accepted the Communist Party of China or the Soviet Union or wherever controlling, owning NBC or CBS.”
National security officials will hold a classified briefing for all House members Tuesday afternoon focused on the threats from TikTok. Appearing on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" this week, Trump, too, said he agreed TikTok is a serious national security threat, but said he could not back banning the app because doing so would help rival Facebook, which he called the “enemy of the people.”
Testifying before Congress, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew has denied that the Chinese government controls the app and pushed back against suggestions that China accesses U.S. user data.
With its back against the wall, TikTok is mobilizing its millions of users to try to pressure lawmakers to oppose the bill. The social media behemoth deployed a pop-up on its app directing users to call their representatives, which overwhelmed congressional offices last week. The in-app messages continued Tuesday, with one saying the “government will take away the community that you and millions of other Americans love.”
Gallagher and Krishnamoorthi sent a letter to Shou to “demand that TikTok stop spreading false claims in its campaign to manipulate and mobilize American citizens on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party.” In a letter, TikTok responded by saying it has “been clear all along that their [Congress'] real goal is to ban TikTok in the United States.”
TikTok creators are on the Hill Tuesday lobbying House and Senate members “about the economic impact of a ban on their livelihoods,” according to a source familiar with the matter.
Shou will meet with senators on Wednesday and Thursday as the fight shifts to the upper chamber.
Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., another Trump acolyte, said she saw Trump's statement on TikTok and is ""taking that into account."" But she added that the U.S. is now at a dangerous crossroads with China.
""And this app has the potential of being a mass surveillance tool against American people. So it’s all about people using social media,"" said Luna, a former Air Force veteran and Instagram influencer. ""You guys know that my background was from being an influencer into Congress. And so obviously taking that into account, but we can’t have something that’s enabling our foreign adversaries.""

2024-03-08T18:33:46.882Z,Trump officially takes over the Republican National Committee,NBC News,"HOUSTON — It’s official: Donald Trump is in charge of the GOP.
Two days after Nikki Haley dropped her presidential bid, the Republican National Committee used its spring meeting here to install a new leadership team hand-picked by the former president, a formal signal of his takeover of the national Republican Party.
The RNC’s membership selected North Carolina Republican Party Chairman Michael Whatley to serve as the party’s new chairman, and Trump's daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, to serve as the co-chair in unanimous votes.
“He will work relentlessly to elect Donald J. Trump as our 47th president of the United States, flip the Senate, expand our majority in the House of Representatives and help us in our individual states,” said Ohio RNC member Jim Dickey, who nominated Whatley for chair.
The election came after a brief bit of private leadership jockeying between Whatley and South Carolina GOP Chairman Drew McKissick, who ultimately did not run for the RNC’s top job after Trump publicly endorsed Whatley.
“Our country and indeed the entire world can’t take four more years of Joe Biden and Democratic control,” Whatley said during his acceptance speech. “In less than eight months we will determine not only the fate of the US but the rest of the word.”
Whatley, who has served as the RNC’s general counsel, replaces Ronna McDaniel. She was Trump’s hand-picked party chair after he won the presidency in 2016, but she has come under fire from the party’s grassroots after the GOP had other disappointing elections in the Trump era, in 2018, 2020 and 2022.
McDaniel gave lengthy farewell remarks, at times fighting off tears as she thanked her family. She listed a series of accomplishments during her seven years as party chair.
“We grew our email list from 3 million to 50 million subscribers,” McDaniel said. “We finally launched a small dollar fundraising platform … we were getting trounced by Democrats over and over again.”
She also made clear that the overturning of Roe v. Wade cost Republicans in the 2022 midterms, and she said she urged more candidates to address abortion, but most did not.
“Not every candidate made it to their destination,” she said. “We can’t put our head in the sand and ignore abortion and the Dobbs decision … The RNC was leading, asking candidates to talk about this issue.”
McDaniel, who got a standing ovation after her remarks, agreed to resign after Trump formally endorsed Whatley. But she continues to have supporters within the RNC, including Kansas RNC Committeewoman Kim Bochers, who praised McDaniel during the meeting’s invocation, saying she had “been through the fire.”
With the party’s new leadership in place and Trump allies firmly in control, the RNC’s next biggest need is clear: raise money.
President Joe Biden and a collection of affiliated Democratic committees have $130 million cash on hand, a number that was just $65 million for Trump and his affiliated committees.
“We have to raise a lot of money,” Lara Trump said during her acceptance speech, holding up a check she said was a $100,000 donation that she had secured at the spring meetings.
A fight over what to do with RNC cash has also created a rift among some members of the party, with an increasing number of Trump supporters urging the RNC to spend its resources on legal bills associated with Trump’s criminal and civil indictments.
Chris LaCivita, a top Trump campaign adviser who will have significant sway over the new RNC structure, has said he does not think party money should be used for Trump resources. But CNBC reported Thursday that there is increasing pressure from RNC members to help pay Trump’s legal bills.
Two resolutions filed by Mississippi RNC Committeeman Henry Barbour that would have functionally barred the RNC from paying Trump’s legal bills. The resolutions did not get near enough support to even be considered at the party’s spring meetings.
“It was a publicity stunt. Never had a chance,” said an RNC member who opposed the measures. “President Trump is the leader of the party, and those never had a chance.”
Whatley, who did not meet with reporters, did not specifically say if he supports using RNC funds for Trump legal bills in his acceptance speech
He told members that “every dollar” raised will be put toward winning elections.
“If a proposal or request comes to us that is not focused on winning in November, it will not be considered,” he said.

2024-03-07T18:15:09.289Z,Biden to focus on 'freedom' in State of the Union — a central theme of his re-election campaign,NBC News,"WASHINGTON — When President Joe Biden launched his campaign last April, the first word he uttered was “Freedom.” As he gives his most important speech as a candidate for re-election Thursday night, the president will return to the theme as a key pillar in making his case to the country.
Biden will do so quite starkly, once again leaning on the example of one of his iconic predecessors. As the 46th president addresses the 118th Congress, he will invoke the 32nd president’s address to the 77th Congress, according to a copy of the speech that was visible in a photo his office published on X. In 1941, Franklin Roosevelt said he was speaking at an “unprecedented moment” in American history — months before the United States would join World War II with the Great Depression still fresh in mind.
The Biden team’s focus on freedom and threats to democracy as a defining electoral issue has often invited criticism from allies, at a time when Americans’ perceptions of the economy, and of the 81-year-old president himself, are also expected to dominate the months ahead.
Follow live updates on the State of the Union address
Advisers understand the importance of Biden’s delivery in answering questions about his age, and agree on the need to help better connect the administration’s economic agenda and accomplishments to the improvements in voters’ everyday lives.
But none of that will matter, aides counter, if America’s democracy falters, a reality the president will starkly warn is possible, and one his advisers say voters have already responded to.
“There was language in the 2020 campaign that democracy and decency were on the ballot. There were voices that thought this was academic — too remote — but now there have been two elections whose results prove that not to have been the case,” the historian Jon Meacham, an informal adviser to the president who helped him prepare his speech, said in an interview.
Roosevelt’s 1941 address became known as his “Four Freedoms” speech; he defined what he called the “four essential human freedoms” — of speech and expression, of worship, freedom from want, and freedom from fear.
Biden, who has a framed painting of Roosevelt displayed prominently in the Oval Office, has already offered his own version of the four freedoms for the 21st century. In a speech that opened 2024, Biden said that freedom itself was on the ballot this year.
“We’ll be voting on many issues: on the freedom to vote and have your vote counted, on the freedom of choice, the freedom to have a fair shot, the freedom from fear,” he said near Valley Forge, Pennsylvania.
Each will be woven through his speech to Congress on Thursday, according to sources familiar with the address, who emphasized that it was still subject to further revisions.
Biden’s State of the Union address Thursday will be one full of both symbolism and substance, with every policy discussed and even the delivery itself seen through the lens of November. But to the small circle of advisers crafting the address, it is quite simple.
“This is a speech about Joe Biden,” as one senior administration official put it. Biden, they said, will “frame this moment in history, and offer a path for the future.”
In Biden’s re-election announcement video, he said the question facing Americans is “whether in the years ahead we have more freedom or less freedom. More rights or fewer.”
It’s been a consistent theme that even pre-dated the launch, though, one that Biden advisers felt was made all too clear in the events of Jan. 6 — 80 years from the day of the Roosevelt speech Biden will reference. And it was brought into a new context by the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision in 2022, which showed the threats to individual freedoms more broadly.
Vice President Kamala Harris, who has been traveling on a “Fight for Reproductive Freedoms” tour, made that immediate connection after the release of the Dobbs decision, which overturned Roe v. Wade and the constitutional right to abortion.
“The great aspiration of our nation has been to expand freedom, but the expansion of freedom clearly is not inevitable,” she said then. “It is not something that just happens — not unless we defend our most fundamental principles.”
She repeated that Sunday during remarks in Selma, Alabama, calling the right to vote “the freedom that unlocks all others.”
In recent campaign appearances, Biden has also warned that former President Donald “Trump and his MAGA friends are determined to take away our fundamental freedoms.” And in advocating for securing funding for Ukraine, Biden has presented a choice: “Are you going to stand up for freedom, or are you going to side with terror and tyranny?  Are you going to stand with Ukraine, or are you going to stand with Putin?  Will we stand with America or — or with Trump?”
It shows what one Democratic strategist who works closely with the White House said was the great quality of freedom as a theme — its versatility.
“It’s definitely something that all Democratic pollsters are testing more now, taking their cues from the speeches they hear"" from the administration, the strategist said. “Republicans tried to run with that, but they became the party of banning books and banning LGBT clubs on school campuses, banning abortion and banning people’s rights.”
Republicans, of course, haven’t fully conceded the theme. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, a possible Trump vice presidential choice, used her State of the State address to highlight what she called her “freedom works here” agenda, including the “freedom to keep and bear arms,” the “freedom to farm and ranch,” and “freedom to be secure.”
But to Biden, freedom and democracy are intertwined as unique themes in part because of the threat he believes Donald Trump poses.
“Democracy is nothing if it does not defend individual freedom against the whims and ambitions of an autocratic force. So I think an argument about freedom is the natural extension of the defense of democracy because they’re so closely entwined,” Meacham said. “Like any responsible president, President Biden has adjusted the intensity of the argument as the facts have warranted. It’s an organic argument, not a static one.”

2024-03-06T15:30:09.381Z,Nikki Haley argued only she could beat Biden. Voters didn't buy it.,NBC News,"For months, before groups both big and small, Nikki Haley would trot out a compelling statistic.
She was in an admirable position, she’d say, because she could beat President Joe Biden by 17 points, citing a Wall Street Journal poll. And even in recent weeks, Haley would argue that Donald Trump, on the other hand, would lose to Biden in the general election or, at the very least, was within the margin of error of losing.
The electability argument became central to Haley’s theory of the case against the former president.
Follow live coverage here.
But aside from her inability to lay out a winning path in the primary campaign, Haley ran up against another problematic fact: Poll after poll has shown Trump would beat Biden.
As time wore on, evidence for Haley’s argument disintegrated. And though she at times still polled ahead of Trump in general election matchups with Biden — a Marquette University poll found Haley would beat Biden by 16 points in Wisconsin among registered voters, while Trump was tied — she failed to gain traction among Republican voters.
And Wednesday, after a disappointing showing on Super Tuesday, she finally ended her bid. In brief remarks, Haley didn’t endorse Trump, saying essentially that the ball was now in his court to show that he could unite divisions within the party.
“It is now up to Donald Trump to earn the votes of those in our party and beyond it who did not support him. And I hope he does that,” Haley said. “At its best politics is about bringing people into your cause, not turning them away. And our conservative cause badly needs more people.”
Haley left open the possibility that she could run again in four years, saying the support she did win was a reflection of dissatisfaction with the status quo.
Haley has demonstrated a fundraising prowess in the last several months, enabling her to remain in the race even as she lost contests across the country. She could use money left in her campaign to power a 2028 bid or move it into a political action committee or another political vehicle for use going forward.
Her remarks capped nearly a year of campaigning, with an unspoken acknowledgment that what she laid out on the court wasn’t enough.
“I’ve been mystified, if not disappointed, by the reaction to the numbers,” said David Oman, a former co-chair of the Iowa Republican Party and a Haley supporter. “In order to change policy, you’ve got to win. It wasn’t just one poll that showed her ahead; it was several. Honestly, I thought people would pay more attention to that, but they didn’t. Trump has a stronghold on the party.”
She built the foundation of her campaign on sand.
Gregg Keller, GOP strategist
Sarah Longwell, a Republican strategist who regularly holds focus groups and counts herself as a “Never Trumper,” said that not only have polls showed Trump could win in a hypothetical general election matchup with Biden, but GOP primary voters just didn’t buy an argument that Biden could pose a threat in November.
“It was a miscalculation,” Longwell said of Haley’s focus on electability. “The majority of Republican voters believe Biden is so weak, that he has dementia — that’s what they believe — so why wouldn’t Trump beat him?”
Electability was just one part of Haley’s argument as she sought the nomination. By the time she dropped out, it was Haley, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, who had the electability problem. She ran up a significant deficit against Trump in the delegate race. And in one case, she lost to the “uncommitted” selection on the ballot in Nevada. More and more, there was evidence that her coalition was made up of independents and even Democrats and that it was losing support of Republicans. They were solidly Trump.
NBC News exit polls of Super Tuesday states Tuesday showed that Trump dominated with conservatives and that, in many cases, they decided to back him even before it became a two-person race.
All along, signs pointing to a Trump hold on GOP support were there.
In a New York Times/Siena College poll in December, Trump moved ahead of Biden in five of six battleground states and led beyond the margin of error in four of them. In January, an NBC News poll found Trump leading Biden by 5 points, within the poll’s margin of error. In February, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and CBS News were among the outlets that published polls with Trump in the lead.
A Monmouth University poll of South Carolina voters published in February found Haley’s electability argument didn’t penetrate. Of those polled, 71% of Republicans told pollsters they believed Trump would definitely or probably beat Biden, while 63% said Haley definitely or probably would.
“She built the foundation of her campaign on sand,” said Gregg Keller, a Republican strategist. “You cannot make polling the sole justification for your campaign, because polls are ever-changing.”
Keller added that part of the GOP electorate doesn’t believe in the results of past elections, much less polling results.
While Haley leaned heavily into polling, she also tried to position herself as the candidate who would bring generational change. She promised a balanced budget and cuts to the federal gas and diesel tax and, more broadly, to bring sanity — not chaos — to the White House. Her stump speeches were heavy on foreign policy, emphasizing the importance of defending NATO allies and staving off Russian aggression against Ukraine.
Haley was the last one standing against Trump, and as that one-on-one race came into focus, she more aggressively attacked him. But that seemed to only cause her unfavorable ratings to rise.
While some Republicans, like Longwell, have faulted Haley for not having gone more aggressive against Trump earlier, Keller argued that would have made little difference. The criminal cases against him have failed to repel Republican voters anyway, he said.
Ultimately, she failed to build a large enough coalition of voters to defeat Trump and faltered in primaries in state after state.
“There was without a doubt an electability lane, but that lane mostly belonged to Ron DeSantis, who blew the once-significant lead he had in late 2022 and early 2023 by taking too long to get into the race,” said Dennis Lennox, a Republican strategist. “By the time Haley finally had her moment, it was too late, and Republicans for assorted reasons did their political calculations and decided to consolidate behind Trump.”
But the bigger failure, Longwell said, was the field as a whole didn’t capitalize on Trump’s real weaknesses and instead granted him dispensation on some of the most severe allegations against him, including the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol and the litany of felony charges he faces.
“It’s always been a collective action problem in the Republican Party. It’s not just Nikki,” she said. “When you defend the guy when he’s indicted on multiple felonies and you build a permission structure for voters to support him — don’t be surprised when they do.”

2024-03-14T00:08:58.820Z,"House passes bill that could ban TikTok in the U.S., sending it to the Senate",NBC News,"WASHINGTON — The House voted Wednesday to pass legislation that could ban TikTok in the U.S. as Republicans and Democrats alike sound the alarm that the popular video-sharing app, owned by a China-based company, is a national security threat.
The vote was 352-65, with one member, Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, voting present. The bill now heads to the Senate, where it faces an uncertain fate and there appears to be less urgency to act.
""Communist China is America’s largest geopolitical foe and is using technology to actively undermine America’s economy and security,"" Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said in a statement after the vote, warning that TikTok could be used to access American data and spread ""harmful"" information.
""Today’s bipartisan vote demonstrates Congress’ opposition to Communist China’s attempts to spy on and manipulate Americans, and signals our resolve to deter our enemies.""
Fifty Democrats and 15 Republicans voted against the bill. Among them were progressives like Reps. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash.; Ro Khanna, D-Calif.; and Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., a Senate candidate, as well as conservatives like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., who lamented that she had previously been banned from social media.
The top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, was a surprising no vote. He also cited free speech issues with the bill.
Adversaries like China ""shut down newspapers, broadcast stations, and social media platforms. We do not,"" Himes said in a statement. ""We trust our citizens to be worthy of their democracy. We do not trust our government to decide what information they may or may not see.""
TikTok, owned by China-based parent company ByteDance, has mounted an aggressive lobbying campaign to kill the legislation, arguing that it would violate the First Amendment rights of its 170 million U.S. users and harm thousands of small businesses that rely on it. ""This process was secret and the bill was jammed through for one reason: it’s a ban,"" the company said on X.
Paul Tran, who, with his wife, has a skin care company called Love and Pebble, protested at a pro-TikTok rally outside the Capitol on Tuesday, with a message for members: ""You will be destroying small businesses like us; this is our livelihood. We’ve created success.""
He said their business nearly shut down last year until TikTok Shop came along and “totally exploded our business.” Now 90% of their business comes from the app, he said.
“If you pass this bill,” Tran said, “you will be destroying the American dream that we really believe in.”
Despite that push, the bill sailed through the House, raising pressure on the Democratic-led Senate to act. President Joe Biden, whose 2024 campaign joined TikTok last month, has said that if the bill reaches his desk, he will sign it into law. Aboard Air Force One on Wednesday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre called the bill ""important,"" saying the administration hopes the Senate will ""take swift action.""
Its backers say it’s wrong to call the legislation an outright ban. Dubbed the Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, the bill would create a process for the president — through the FBI and intelligence agencies — to designate certain social media applications under the control of foreign adversaries, like China, Russia, Iran and North Korea, as national security threats.
Once an app was deemed a risk, it would be banned from online app stores and web-hosting services unless it severed ties with entities under control of the foreign adversary within 180 days of the designation. That means TikTok, which FBI Director Christopher Wray has testified poses a risk to national security, could face a ban unless ByteDance acted quickly to divest it.
“What we’re after is a separation from TikTok from its parent company, ByteDance, and by extension CCP,” the bill’s author, Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., chairman of the select committee investigating the Chinese Communist Party, said Tuesday as he left a classified all-House briefing about the dangers of TikTok. “And in that world, TikTok users can continue to use the platform. In fact, I think it would allow for a better user experience.”
U.S. lawmakers and intelligence officials worry the Chinese government could use TikTok to access personal data from its millions of users and use algorithms to show them videos that could influence their views, including in the coming presidential election. Testifying before Congress a year ago, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew denied that the Chinese government controls the app and pushed back against suggestions that China accesses U.S. user data.
In a video posted after Wednesday's vote, Chew said that a ban would harm TikTok creators and small businesses that use the platform and give ""more power to a handful of other social media companies.""
""Over the last few years, we have invested to keep your data safe on our platform — free from outside manipulation. We have committed that we will continue to do so,"" Chew said. ""We will continue to do all we can, including exercising our legal rights, to protect this amazing platform.""
Asked about the bill before Wednesday's vote, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said that ""despite the lack of evidence proving TikTok poses a threat to U.S. national security, the U.S. has continued to suppress TikTok.""
""This practice of resorting to bullying tactics when unable to win in fair competition disrupts normal business operations, damages international investors' confidence in the investment environment, and undermines the normal international economic and trade order, ultimately harming the U.S. itself,"" he continued.
In writing the bill, Gallagher teamed up with the top Democrat on the China panel, Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois, who consulted with former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., an outspoken critic of China's human rights violations throughout her long career.
“My concern is about what TikTok has done in Taiwan, saying that the Uyghurs love their genocide and the people of Hong Kong love their voter suppression,” Pelosi told reporters.
But she added: ""We want TikTok to exist; we’re not here to ban it. I’ve said we want to make it Tik-Tok-Toe. We want to make it something that is not a fearful social media platform but one that is very positive. And in order to do that, we have to see the divesting of it from the Chinese government having custodial possession of the data. ... Who controls the algorithm controls all of it.""
Krishnamoorthi and Gallagher praised the passage of the bill in a joint statement, saying they'll work with the Senate to advance it as well.
""Today, a bipartisan group of members came together to address the grave national security risk posed by TikTok,"" they said. ""We speak with one voice and carry the same message as the Directors of the DIA, FBI, CIA, NSA, and the head of U.S. Cyber Command — TikTok cannot continue to operate in the United States under its current ownership structure.""
The multibillion-dollar social media behemoth's presence was everywhere on Capitol Hill ahead of the House vote. TikTok users got pop-ups on the app urging them to call their local representatives, as well as push notifications saying: ""Help stop the TikTok shutdown.""
Outside the Capitol, a handful of young House Democrats — Robert Garcia and Sara Jacobs of California, Maxwell Frost of Florida, and Delia Ramirez of Illinois — rallied alongside TikTok creators to express their opposition to the bill.
Frost, 27, called himself a “hell no” on the bill and predicted that if the vote had been delayed by a week, opposition would have grown.
JT Laybourne, one of the creators, said he is “disgusted” to hear lawmakers mocking TikTok and the creators on it because millions of small businesses rely on it.
“My voice is on TikTok. My purpose is on TikTok. That’s it. We can’t let this happen,” Laybourne pleaded.

Biden brought up the conservative majority’s landmark reversal of Roe v. Wade. He had begun to read an excerpt of the decision when he began a brief aside, looking right at the justices sitting in the front row.
“With all due respect, justices, women are not without ... electoral or political power,"" he said.
Then, in what appeared to be an ad-libbed moment, he added, ""You’re about to realize just how much …” before Democrats in the chamber jumped to their feet and cheered.
The justices, dressed in their traditional black robes, sat expressionless but looking forward as the applause and reaction thundered around them. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who was among those sitting beside the group, stood to applaud.
It rare to see any interaction between a president and the Supreme Court justices, but in 2010, conservative Justice Samuel Alito appeared to mouth ""not true"" or ""simply not true"" when President Barack Obama criticized the court's ruling in Citizens United, removing corporate campaign spending limits.
Alito has not attended a State of the Union address since then.
Biden hit on several themes related to women's reproductive rights, including an Alabama Supreme Court decision that has caused mass confusion in the state over in vitro fertilization.

2024-03-07T20:47:02.089Z,‘Done deal’: Allies say Trump aide Brian Jack would be favorite in Georgia congressional race,NBC News,"Former President Donald Trump is urging a longtime political aide to run for an open congressional seat in Georgia, something GOP operatives in the state say has been in the works for a long time.
Trump posted Thursday on Truth Social urging Brian Jack, a senior adviser to his 2024 presidential bid, to run for Georgia’s 3rd Congressional District, a Republican-heavy seat being vacated by Republican Drew Ferguson, who said in December he was not running for another term.
“Brian has been thinking about running to succeed Drew, as he has always sought to accomplish incredible things for Georgia and our Country,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “I encourage Brian, a Fayette County [Georgia] native, to go for it, pursue his dream, and run for Congress.”
Jack has not discussed the issue publicly and did not respond to a request for comment. But longtime Georgia Republicans say that the idea has long been in the works ahead of Friday’s filing deadline, and they said if Jack were to run, he would likely win by wide margins.
“Brian Jack will win this race going away,” said a veteran Georgia Republican. “He’s well respected in Georgia political circles, has community and grassroots support, and most of all — the big guy’s approval.”
“This thing is a done deal,” the person said.
David Bossie, a Republican National Committeeman from Maryland and a longtime Trump adviser, said he agrees Jack would easily win the seat.
“I’m in complete agreement with President Trump. Brian Jack is a great conservative America First candidate for Georgia’s 3rd Congressional District,” Bossie said. “Brian will fight the failed status quo in D.C. and be a leader for Georgia and America when President Trump is back in the White House.”
Ben Howard, who ran Trump’s House legislative affairs team, said that “if he runs” Jack would be a perfect fit for the Trump-dominated seat.
“Simply put, Brian is a results-oriented person who consistently produced on behalf of President Trump, both at the White House and on the campaign,” Howard said.
Jack is not only a top aide on Trump’s 2024 campaign, but he also served as White House political director during Trump’s first term in office from 2019 to 2021. Before he rejoined Trump’s team, he worked as political director for former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., who hired him in early 2021 to help lead GOP efforts to win the House majority in the midterms.
He has also held political roles with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and the Republican National Committee.
Georgia’s 3rd District is an overwhelming Republican seat that Trump won by 30 points in 2020.
That political alignment makes the former president’s endorsement all the more likely that if Jack decides to run, he is likely to face little legitimate opposition.
“Brian is a man of Loyalty, Honesty, and integrity, and will never let the fabulous people of Georgia’s 3rd Congressional District down,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Should he decide to run, Brian Jack has my Complete and Total Endorsement!”

2024-03-08T22:39:59.359Z,Why the third-party role in 2024 is so unpredictable: From the Politics Desk,NBC News,"Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team’s latest reporting and analysis from the campaign trail, the White House and Capitol Hill.
In today’s edition, political embed Katherine Koretski and senior politics reporter Alex Seitz-Wald, who have immersed themselves in the third-party battle to make a mark on 2024, report on the latest announcement by No Labels and what's next in that group's 2024 plans. Plus, Kristen Welker digs into the State of the Union and what's next for President Joe Biden after the big speech.
No Labels held a virtual 800-person delegate meeting Friday, where the members voted to move forward with the process of forming a presidential ticket to run in the 2024 election.
There’s just one hitch: The group doesn’t have an actual candidate yet — and nothing about Friday made it clear whether it ever will.
Do you have a news tip? Let us know
The outside group’s long-running dalliance with the 2024 presidential race illustrates why, even with so much else about the election seemingly set in stone, it’s still hard to say how much the many third-party candidates and groups eyeing this race could actually matter in November.
And it’s not just because third-party candidates often lose support in polls as Election Day draws nearer, though that is a real trend. There are two major logistical hurdles that can make things difficult.
State ballot access: Getting on the ballot as an independent is time-consuming and expensive. It’s why Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is leaning on a super PAC to help gather signatures to place him on state ballots, though he faces a campaign finance complaint alleging improper coordination with the super PAC American Values 2024 in those efforts.
No Labels has a well-financed effort to get on the ballot in all 50 states and is currently on 16, including the key swing states of Arizona and Nevada.
Candidate selection: Usually, the third-party candidate comes first and a movement grows around them, to the extent they can build one. No Labels is working things the opposite way, building the ballot-access machinery before finding a candidate. The organization said in a statement Friday that it will be “accelerating” its candidate outreach and announcing a process for how candidates will be selected on March 14.
Without knowing answers to these two big questions — who are the candidates, and where will they be on the ballot? — it’s impossible to say how the third-party vote will affect the 2024 race. And it could be a while before we know final answers on both fronts.

President Joe Biden fired up base Democrats in his State of the Union speech. He worked to address concerns about his age. He made contrast after contrast with former President Donald Trump, referring to “my predecessor” 13 times.
As one Democratic strategist described the speech to me: “The agenda is geared to a Democratic audience, the patriotism to a swing audience, and the good delivery to the whole country.”
How those last two groups respond to Biden’s energy, message and contrasts with Trump may be the most important question of the general election. That includes the middle of the country fed up with the nation’s direction, tired of its polarized politics and disillusioned by the prospect of a general election featuring two men in their late 70s and early 80s.
The middle of the electorate, including the slice that voted for Nikki Haley in the GOP primaries, could very well decide the outcome of a 2024 presidential election that’s still some 240 days away — whether by voting for Biden or Trump, casting ballots for a third-party candidate or sitting out the election entirely.
Remember, it was Biden’s strength with the middle that helped catapult him to the White House in 2020, when he won independents by 13 points and moderates by 30 points, according to the NBC News exit poll.
Now? The latest NBC News poll has Biden ahead of Trump among moderates by just 13 points and trailing by 6 points among independents — down considerably from 2020.
The good news for Biden is that Thursday’s State of the Union address clearly energized Democrats, took the fight to Trump and tamped down concerns about his age (at least for the time being).
Now, we have to see how long the speech will play (remember, Biden gave an equally forceful and combative State of the Union in early 2023) — and how it will play with the middle and those up-for-grabs Haley voters.

2024-03-13T09:00:41.000Z,Abortion is a top concern for Trump as he considers his VP pick,NBC News,"PALM BEACH, Fla. — Last month at Mar-a-Lago, former President Donald Trump was dining on the outdoor patio, engaging in his regular habit of stopping by the tables of club members and talking about whatever issue was top of mind.
On this day, the GOP’s challenges on the issue of abortion became the focus when a member brought up the midterm elections and the hit Republicans took over reproductive rights. According to a source who was present, the member told Trump to pick a running mate who isn’t too hard-line on the issue. Trump then began making the rounds polling his dinner guests about abortion and the veepstakes.
In particular, he asked the diners — who included his campaign aides and club members — what they thought of the vocal anti-abortion-rights views of Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina. Would they turn off voters?
According to two sources close to Trump, including the person at the dinner, Trump has been laser-focused on the abortion issue, especially when it comes to his vice presidential pick. He sees it as the one major advantage for Democrats and a vulnerability for Republicans.
“The president understands it as a treacherous issue — one that you can actually trip up and fall on your face with,” said the source, a person familiar with his thinking. The person added that Trump would most likely not risk picking “someone with a six-week ban in their discussions or someone without any commitment on the exceptions.”
In addition to Scott, the second source said, Trump has been asking about where other potential vice presidential contenders stand on abortion, specifically naming Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida.
“He’s concerned it will have a drag on the ticket if they’re seen as holding too staunch a position,” the person said.
The two sources said it has been a point of discussion among advisers and donors, as well, with people waving some red and yellow flags for certain shortlisters.
The candidates most frequently mentioned with some concern are Scott and South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem.
Noem’s team confirmed to NBC News that she met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago on Feb. 26, but it declined to disclose any details about the conversation. Her state was among those with trigger bans that took effect after the Dobbs decision overturned Roe v. Wade. Abortion is now completely banned there, with an exception only to save the life of the woman.
She has called herself an “absolutist” on the issue, and she defended her state’s lack of rape and incest exceptions when she was asked in a CNN interview whether a 10-year-old rape victim should be forced to give birth. Last year, Noem told CBS News that her state’s ban on abortion is “a model for the Republican Party.”
“I’m pro-life, however as a mom and grandma, I want to help moms and families through whatever difficult situation they may be facing,” Noem said in a statement to NBC News. “We have to talk about this difficult issue with heart and with compassion. We don’t win by hiding from the conversation. Women on both sides feel strongly about the issue. But the women I talk to everyday around the country are more concerned about how Joe Biden’s America is making it harder for their kids and grandkids to achieve the American Dream.”
South Carolina doesn’t have an all-out ban like South Dakota, but it recently passed a fetal heartbeat ban that outlaws abortion at around six weeks — a time when many women don’t even know they are pregnant.
Scott is on the record praising the six-week ban; he called it “good news” last year. In an interview in April 2023, he left the door open for such a ban at the federal level. Scott said he would “sign the most conservative pro-life legislation that they can get through Congress.”
Asked whether he would sign it even if it were a six-week ban, he declined to provide a number of weeks but said he would back whatever conservative abortion bill Congress could get to his desk. In his campaign launch video, he vowed to “protect the right to life,” and at the first GOP primary debate, he said he would support a federal abortion ban, saying, “We must solve that issue with a 15-week limit, at a minimum.”
In an interview with The Post and Courier newspaper of Charleston, South Carolina, he said he would support exceptions to abortion in cases of rape or incest and instances in which the life of the woman was at risk.
He was also critical of Trump on abortion during the campaign, telling Fox News, “I think the former president is wrong on the issue,” responding to Trump’s criticism of Florida’s six-week ban.
Scott’s office declined to comment for this article.
“I would be stunned beyond belief if he chose somebody that gave him complications around that issue,” said one of the sources close to Trump, mentioning both Scott and Noem as among those who might do just that.
Donors are also chiming in with concerns. Given the campaign’s money challenges amid costly legal battles, getting it right on abortion could have financial implications, too. A woman who is a major Trump and GOP donor told NBC News she is wary of a ticket with Scott given his “fervent” posture on abortion; she said she recently reached out to a Trump adviser to express concern.
She said she likes Scott and understands where he’s coming from but worries he would be too hard a sell to voters.
“We don’t have that much bandwidth to explain where he’s coming from. We have to explain to women that we trust them. I think his statements on the campaign trail, where he would sign a 20-week or a 16-week or a six-week abortion ban in a nanosecond, is just — there’s no way the Republican Party can withstand that and the Democrats’ fundraising on that,” the donor said.
As Republicans have taken hits at the ballot box when abortion has been a key issue, Democrats are again betting that the issue of reproductive rights can help drive voters to the polls.
A Democratic strategist expressed hope that Trump chooses Scott or Noem, because Democrats would “have a field day” with them.
“When you have the second-highest candidate for office on their ticket supporting these types of policies ... that is going to bleed into races all the way down ballot. You would see that in television ads in every state in every race. ... This just only makes our job easier,” the strategist said.
Trump is keenly aware of that dynamic. Three sources said it has been eating at him since the 2022 midterms, when he was highly disappointed in the abortion rhetoric from multiple candidates he himself endorsed. As a result, he has become increasingly focused on how to shift and sharpen the Republican strategy.
“Abortion is Donald Trump’s singular focus in the book of issues. He sees it as existential for the party. He understands how it plays in specific states. He understands how people have played it and won or lost,” one of the sources said.
Stefanik, another possible running-mate pick, has been vocally “pro-life” and has supported a 15-week federal abortion ban, with exceptions in cases of rape or incest or to save the life of the woman. Stefanik has also supported legislation that would impose prison sentences of up to five years on doctors who perform abortions after 20 weeks, with exceptions for rape, incest and health of the mother.
But her stance more closely aligns with what Trump has said both publicly and privately. The New York Times recently reported that Trump likes the idea of a 16-week national ban as he tries to appeal to the majority of Americans who support abortion rights, without alienating his conservative base. The Trump campaign has denied the Times’ reporting.
Trump has generally been careful about wading in on abortion, telling NBC News in September he thought he could bring “both sides” together. He has criticized members of his party who endorse abortion bans with no exceptions. But he is also inextricably tied to the issue, having named three of the conservative Supreme Court justices who ultimately overturned Roe v. Wade.
Also on the list is Donalds, whose website declares an anti-abortion position, saying, “Every life is valuable, from conception to natural death, and I will fight to protect the life of every unborn child without exception.”
Donalds recently said he backs in vitro fertilization, but in 2021, he also co-sponsored the Life at Conception Act, which says people at “all stages of life, including the moment of fertilization, cloning, or other moment at which an individual comes into being,” have constitutional rights. He didn’t co-sponsor the measure when it was re-introduced in the new Congress.
Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, a famed neurosurgeon who ran for president in 2016, has also been rumored as a possible pick. And while he has a murky record on the issue, those worried about the likes of Scott and Noem aren’t as concerned about Carson, because they feel his views are older news and aren’t as ripe for Democrats to exploit.
At a Fox News town hall last month, Trump said the most important thing he was looking for in a running mate was “somebody that you think will be a good president” in case “something should happen.”
National press secretary Karoline Levitt said in a statement, “President Trump appointed strong Constitutionalist federal judges and Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe v. Wade and sent the decision back to the states, which others have tried to do for over 50 years.”
Trump’s decision also comes at a time when some red states are tacking further right on reproductive rights. The Alabama Supreme Court ruling that embryos are children, which paused in vitro fertilization treatment in the state, was “politically a boon to Democrats,” the Democratic strategist said.
“It shows,” the strategist said, that “what Democrats have been saying would come to pass since the fall of Roe is not hyperbole.”

2024-03-08T19:44:04.555Z,No Labels delegates vote to continue pursuing a third-party presidential ticket,NBC News,"The third-party organization No Labels held a virtual 800-person delegate meeting Friday, where the members voted to move forward with the process of forming a presidential ticket to run in the 2024 election against President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump.
While the vote reaffirmed No Labels' longstanding project, it's still unclear what happens next. An official ticket was not announced at this meeting, but the group says it is moving forward with discussions with potential individuals.
“They voted near unanimously to continue our 2024 project and to move immediately to identify candidates to serve on the Unity presidential ticket. Every one of our delegates had their own explanation for wanting to move ahead,"" said No Labels convention chairman Mike Rawlings.
The organization said in a statement that it will be ""accelerating"" its candidate outreach and announcing a process for how candidates will be selected on March 14.
A number of people discussed as potential No Labels candidates have taken themselves out of the running. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., announced last month that he would not be seeking a bid for the White House, though he is currently on a listening tour speaking to voters across the country. Former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, recently launched a campaign for Senate in his state.
No Labels chief strategist Ryan Clancy said that “No Labels has not yet chosen a ticket and any names floating around are being put out there by someone else.”
And while the discussion of potential candidates is ongoing, No Labels is still working on its goal of getting ballot access in all 50 states for the fall.
No Labels is currently on the ballot in 16 states, their organization says, including key swing states Arizona and Nevada.
No Labels was founded in 2010 to promote bipartisanship in Washington, but it took a dramatic turn in the runup to the 2024 election by announcing it would put forward a “unity ticket” for president as an alternative to the major parties.
With many Americans unhappy with either of their likely choices for president and frustration with politics rampant among voters, the time is ripe for another option, they argue.
Indeed, 2024 has seen a bumper crop of high-profile third-party presidential efforts, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and civil rights activist Cornel West, in addition to No Labels and the familiar Libertarian and Green Party tickets.
Kennedy is currently working on his own ballot access mission across the country. He is currently on the ballot in Utah and is actively gathering and submitting signatures for multiple others, though he faces a campaign finance complaint alleging improper coordination with the super PAC American Values 2024 in those efforts.
No Labels’ entry into presidential politics alienated some former officials, donors, and allies, especially among Democrats, who worry that any third party candidate will just syphon anti-Trump votes away from Biden.
No Labels has denied those allegations, saying it would only support a third-party slate if it had a real chance of winning. The organization has have vowed to halt its activities if data suggests its candidate would be a mere spoiler.
But most of No Labels’ decision-making has been kept private, as have its donors, and officials have occasionally made contradictory statements, making it difficult for people outside the organization to understand its methods and motives.

2024-03-06T20:58:48.132Z,Pennsylvania senators split over LGBTQ center as Congress races to avoid a shutdown,NBC News,"WASHINGTON — An unusual clash over money for a Philadelphia LGBTQ community center and a pro-gun provision has created turmoil over a government funding bill as Congress seeks to pass it days before the deadline to avert a partial shutdown.
The legislation is still expected to pass, barring any surprises, but it has caused some intraparty tension among Democrats ahead of a deadline late Friday to keep the government funded.
It began when Sens. John Fetterman and Bob Casey, both D-Pa., issued letters Tuesday to top appropriators withdrawing support for funding for the community center. Senate leaders moved to speedily remove the money from the bill.
Around the same time, the conservative X account “Libs of TikTok” sent a viral post indicating that the center rents its space out to a third party that hosts biweekly parties involving “BDSM, kink and fetish” among adults. A Democratic source said appropriators had been given the information by a different organization — not Libs of TikTok — and flagged it to the two Pennsylvania senators.
“We received new information and decided not to support the appropriation,” Casey said Wednesday, adding that he believes the money has been rescinded.
In a strange turn of events, Fetterman then told reporters Wednesday that his staff sent the letter without his knowledge and that he continues to support the funding for the community center “1,000%” despite “faux outrage from the Libs of TikTok.”
“Let me be clear, that wasn’t my decision. This was a perfunctory letter that was issued by the staff. I was not part of that process,” he said.
In an emailed statement, Fetterman added: “The William Way LGBT Community Center has been doing critical work in Philadelphia for decades. I do not believe that we should penalize this center based on events that are entirely legal among consenting adults. I have no problem with what consenting adults do in their private time.”
“The choice was either to pull it or watch it get stripped out, attacked by Republicans, and ultimately killed. This is not the end of this fight and I am going to fight for William Way to secure their funding in the FY25 appropriations process,” Fetterman said. “I’m new here, but I wasn’t aware that Democratic values and priorities are dictated by Libs of Tik Tok.”
Casey, who faces re-election this fall, is standing by his call to revoke the funding, unlike Fetterman.
“Senator Casey has been a leader and ally in the fight to protect LGBTQ rights in the U.S. Senate and will continue to support the LGBTQ community in the Commonwealth. He believes that consenting adults have the right to do whatever they want in their free time, but these types of appropriations projects warrant the highest level of scrutiny on behalf of taxpayers,” Casey spokesperson Mairead Lynn said in a statement. “Senator Casey withdrew his request for federal funding when new information about the third-party use of the facility emerged.”
That wasn't the only instance of last-minute drama ahead of a House vote in the afternoon.
Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., announced Wednesday that he'll oppose the funding bill because of a pro-gun provision for veterans that “could result in 20,000 new seriously mentally ill individuals being able to buy guns each year” and “will be a death sentence for many.”
“Republicans (and one or two Democrats) pushed for the new rider that allows, for the first time in 30 years, veterans judged by the VA to be mentally incompetent to buy guns,” Murphy said in a statement. “These are very very mentally ill veterans — those at the highest risk of suicide.”
He said Democratic leaders shouldn’t have given in to that demand.
“I don’t know why we accepted the first gun-lobby rider in decades,” Murphy, an outspoken proponent of tougher gun laws, said in an interview. “I cannot accept this as the new normal.”
Still, it’s not clear how many Democrats join him, as Sens. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., both told NBC News they had concerns about the gun provision but weren’t willing to torpedo the package and force a shutdown over it. In the House, the top Democratic appropriator, Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, and Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., a leadership member, said they opposed the gun provision but intended to support the overall bill.
Meanwhile, scores of House conservatives came out against the legislation, complaining that it wouldn't do enough to cut spending or advance Republican policy priorities, such as defunding federal prosecutors involved with securing indictments of former President Donald Trump.
""The House is about to pass a #SwampOmnibus that fully funds the Justice Department’s prosecution of presidential candidates,"" the House Freedom Caucus's official account posted on X.
Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, said: “Republicans will go around and they’ll talk about how they scored major wins — how they somehow delivered for the American people. The fact of the matter is we did no such thing.”

2024-03-09T02:02:52.844Z,Prosecutors say Hunter Biden invented 'a conspiracy theory' in effort to dismiss tax charges,NBC News,"Federal prosecutors on Friday filed their opposition to efforts by Hunter Biden’s attorneys to dismiss tax-related charges filed against the president’s son last year.
Lawyers from special counsel David Weiss’ office forcefully rejected Biden’s assertion that the case against him was politically motivated and that prosecutors sought to appease congressional Republicans in bringing additional charges after a plea deal fell apart last year.
“The defendant concocts a conspiracy theory that the prosecution has ‘upped the ante’ to appease politicians who have absolutely nothing to do with the prosecution and are not even members of the current Executive Branch,” prosecutors wrote.
The filing came in a series of documents filed in federal court in California, with Weiss’ team hitting back at various motions to dismiss the indictment.
In response to Biden’s arguments that the additional charges came amid pressure from Republicans on Capitol Hill, Weiss’ team said that prosecutors had signed proposed agreements for Biden’s plea “weeks after politicians had railed against them,” and highlighted the prosecution’s actions urging the court to accept the proposed agreements.
“To state an obvious fact that the defendant continues to ignore, former President Trump is not the President of the United States,” they wrote.
“The defendant fails to explain how President Biden or the Attorney General, to whom the Special Counsel reports, or the Special Counsel himself, or his team of prosecutors, are acting at the direction of former President Trump or Congressional Republicans, or how this current Executive Branch approved allegedly discriminatory charges against the President’s son at the direction of former President Trump and Congressional Republicans,” they added.
Biden’s attorneys did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday’s filings. The special counsel’s office declined to comment.
The judge overseeing the case told Biden’s attorneys to respond to the special counsel’s filings later this month.
Attorneys for Biden had also argued last month that Weiss’ appointment as special counsel was unlawful.
Prosecutors disputed those claims Friday, writing “these arguments are meritless and should be denied,” and arguing that Weiss’ appointment “conforms to the law in all respects.”
Biden pleaded not guilty to nine tax-related charges when he was arraigned in January.
In addition to the tax charges, Biden also faces federal gun charges that include an allegation that he possessed a firearm while using a narcotic. He has pleaded not guilty to those charges as well.
House Republicans have targeted Biden in their impeachment inquiry into his father. Their probe took a major hit last month when former FBI informant Alexander Smirnov, whose claims played a prominent role in sparking the GOP investigation, was indicted and accused of feeding false information to the FBI about Joe Biden and his son during the 2020 presidential campaign.
Hunter Biden appeared for a closed-door deposition with the House Oversight and Judiciary committees last month as part of the impeachment inquiry, and blasted the probe, which has yet to provide any evidence of criminal wrongdoing, as a “baseless and destructive political charade” based on “MAGA-motivated conspiracies.”
Hunter Biden’s more than six hours of testimony — in which he emphatically denied GOP allegations against him and notably did not at any point invoke his Fifth Amendment rights — appears to have weakened support for an impeachment among House Republicans, NBC News has reported. Republicans have since invited Hunter Biden to testify publicly, on March 20, but he has yet to say whether he will attend the hearing.

2024-03-14T15:21:40.002Z,Trump lawyers argue Florida judge should dismiss classified documents case,NBC News,"FORT PIERCE, Fla. — Former President Donald Trump was in a Florida courtroom Thursday as his lawyers argued a judge should dismiss the federal criminal case involving his handling of classified documents on the grounds that the Presidential Records Act bars his prosecution.
Trump’s legal team was arguing its position on whether all or some of the charges should be thrown out because of the 1978 law that governs the preservation of information during and following a presidency.
Special counsel Jack Smith has called on the judge overseeing the case to reject Trump’s claim that he should be shielded from prosecution because classified presidential records “can be transformed into ‘personal’” records by removing them from the White House. Trump has said that he designated the materials he took to Mar-a-Lago as personal records while still in office. A president's personal records are excluded from the act's requirements.
The sides will also discuss a second motion to dismiss the case on the theory that the main statute used against Trump is unconstitutionally vague as it applies to presidents and can’t be used against him.
U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon asked Trump's legal team to present their arguments on both motions first, to be followed by prosecutors from Smith's office. She's said she expected the arguments to go throughout the day. The first motion Trump's attorneys addressed was their ""unconstitutionally vague"" argument.
Trump has pleaded not guilty to the charges that he wrongfully held on to classified information after leaving the White House. One of Trump's co-defendants, Walt Nauta, was present at the hearing, but the other, Carlos De Oliveira, was not present when the case was called. Trump's lawyers had indicated in a court filing earlier this week that both would be there.
Their lawyers have sparred with the government over the timing of the trial, originally scheduled to begin May 20, but which Cannon is expected to push back. The judge granted the defendant's request for more time but has not set a new trial date.
Trump is facing dozens of felony charges in the indictment, including willful retention of national defense information, false statements and representations, conspiracy to obstruct justice, withholding a document or record and corruptly concealing a document. He has denied all wrongdoing.
Trump’s co-defendants have also pleaded not guilty to the related charges against them in the indictment. The special counsel accused Nauta, who served as Trump's valet and continued to work for him after leaving the White House, and De Oliveira, a Mar-a-Lago property manager, of seeking to erase security footage at Mar-a-Lago after the Justice Department sought to obtain it. De Oliveira is also accused of making false statements to prosecutors.
Trump has appeared in court more often in recent months, attending most of a trial in writer E. Jean Carroll’s second defamation case against him this year and several days of the monthslong civil fraud trial brought against him and his business by New York Attorney General Letitia James late last year.
In a court filing asking for more time to respond to other outstanding motions in the documents case, Trump’s attorneys said they were preparing for the March 25 start date of his New York criminal trial.
Trump’s lawyers are also seeking to delay the trials until after the U.S. Supreme Court rules on his claims of presidential immunity because it could affect how the case proceeds.

2024-03-11T15:18:52.194Z,Trump again attacks E. Jean Carroll as he appeals rape defamation penalties,NBC News,"Donald Trump on Monday once again denied writer E. Jean Carroll’s rape and defamation claims against him, despite facing nearly $90 million in civil penalties over similar denials.
Speaking on CNBC’s “Squawk Box,” the presumptive Republican presidential nominee claimed that the numerous judgments against him in New York will prompt companies to leave the state.
They’re “the most ridiculous decisions,” Trump said, “including the Ms. Bergdorf Goodman, a person I’d never met.”
“I have no idea who she is, except one thing, I got sued,” he said. “From that point on I said, ‘Wow, that’s crazy, what this is.’”
“I got charged, I was given a false accusation and had to post a $91 million bond on a false accusation,” Trump added.
He was referring to Carroll, who in 2019 first publicly accused the then-president of raping her in a dressing room at Bergdorf Goodman, the Manhattan department store, in the mid-1990s. Carroll sued Trump in New York federal court for defaming her, after he denied the rape claim and accused her of trying to sell books.
In 2022, Carroll sued Trump a second time for battery and defamation relating to the alleged rape and a subsequent denial after he left the White House.
Trump in that Oct. 12, 2022, statement also referred to Carroll as “Ms. Bergdorf Goodman.”
A federal civil jury last May awarded Carroll $5 million in damages in that case after finding Trump liable for sexual abuse and defamation.
In January, another federal civil jury in Manhattan ordered Trump to pay $83.3 million for defaming Carroll through the statements he made as president.
Trump is appealing both verdicts. On Friday, he posted a $91.6 million bond to secure the most recent judgment while he appeals the jury decision.
In Carroll’s other case, Trump has already put up $5.6 million in security pending his appeal.
In Monday’s interview with CNBC, Trump claimed that his legal battles in New York, including a civil business fraud case resulting in $464 million in total fines and interest, will result in companies leaving New York.
“People aren’t moving into New York, because of the kind of crap they’re pulling on me,” he said.
An attorney for Carroll and a spokesman for Trump did not immediately respond to CNBC’s request for comment on the former president’s latest remarks about the writer.
Trump at a Saturday rally had also accused Carroll of making “false accusations.”

2024-03-13T22:39:53.067Z,The Republican National Committee sues Michigan over the state's voter rolls,NBC News,"The Republican National Committee sued Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat, on Wednesday in an attempt to force election officials to trim down the state’s voter rolls.
The lawsuit, which was filed in federal court, argues that Michigan is violating the National Voter Registration Act’s requirement to maintain clean and accurate vote registration rolls.
The move comes just days after Trump allies effectively took over the RNC's leadership ahead of the 2024 election.
“At least 53 Michigan counties have more active registered voters than they have adult citizens who are over the age of 18. That number of voters is impossibly high,” the lawsuit said. “An additional 23 counties have active-voter registration rates that exceed 90 percent of adult citizens over the age of 18. That figure far eclipses the national and statewide voter registration rate in recent elections.”
America’s voter roll system is built for registration, not removal. The rolls often include outdated registration as most voters do not remove themselves from the system when they move.
And while federal law requires officials take steps to keep the rolls up-to-date, it also protects voters from overzealous purges by requiring that officials wait years to remove a voter who has simply stopped casting a ballot.
Still, there’s no evidence that bloated voter rolls lead to voter fraud, even as Republicans increasingly seize on the rolls as a focus of their election activism.
Benson told NBC News in a statement that election officials in the state have ""done more in the last five years than was done in the previous two decades to remove deceased voters and ineligible citizens from our voting rolls and ensure their accuracy.""
She said more than 700,000 voters have have been removed from the voter rolls since she took office, while another half million will be removed if they do not vote in this year's general election.
""Let’s call this what it is: a PR campaign masquerading as a meritless lawsuit filled with baseless accusations that seek to diminish people’s faith in the security of our elections. Shame on anyone who abuses the legal process to sow seeds of doubt in our democracy,"" Benson added.
Since the 2020 election, some Republican activists have taken to personally challenging the eligibility of thousands of voters and developing a computer program they believe will help them find fraud.
In recent years, conservative activists also seized on a prominent voter roll maintenance program known as ERIC (the Electronic Registration Information Center), a bipartisan, interstate partnership that helps states share data to keep their voter rolls up-to-date. After conspiracy theories about ERIC flourished, nine GOP-lead states left the program, taking their data with them and weakening the coalition's efficacy.
The RNC suit in Michigan, a key battleground state, suggests voter rolls may become a more central part of the GOP's election law strategy.
The filing occurred the same day NBC News reported that two election lawyers, Charlie Spies and Christina Bobb, were joining the RNC.
Bobb has been a prominent advocate of the GOP's baseless claims that the 2020 election was stolen. She will serve as senior counsel for election integrity, while Spies, a longtime lawyer for the GOP, serves as general counsel.
Speaking to conservative activists in 2021, Spies disputed election conspiracy theories and pushed supporters to adopt election changes that would make the system more palatable to Republicans.
“The deal is early voting is not going away,” he said. “We’ve got to take advantage of that, and telling people not to vote early is cutting your nose off to spite your face. It doesn’t work.”
He continued: “We change the system, make us super confident in it,” he said. “Then encourage people to vote using the laws that we have.”

2024-03-12T23:00:07.169Z,How a small city in Oregon could shape the way major U.S. cities handle homelessness,NBC News,"GRANTS PASS, Ore. — For more than five years, Helen Cruz lived on the streets of Grants Pass.
A small, rural town of roughly 40,000 people, the city has now found itself at the center of a homeless crisis plaguing major cities across the U.S.
“We’re in this situation not because we want to be. We’re in this situation because we don’t have a choice right now,” Cruz, 49, said in an interview.
For years, Grants Pass has been embroiled in a contentious lawsuit with homeless residents like Cruz, who argue that anti-camping ordinances enacted by the city — including fines for sleeping in any park or public space — violate their constitutional rights.
The legal battle has now gone all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which is scheduled to hear arguments in the case on April 22. The decision could affect how cities nationwide address homelessness in their communities.
Cruz, who couldn’t afford rent, said she often slept in a tent in a city park. Although she is no longer homeless — working and living at a small local church — she said she still has more than $6,000 in tickets and fines.
“My credit is shot. I have no credit. None,” Cruz said. “Anything they want to write a ticket for, they do.”
Cruz and other residents say that because Grants Pass has no low-barrier, full-time homeless shelter, they have no alternative but the street. It’s for that reason they argue the city has violated the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution, barring cruel and unusual punishment.
“They are saying because we don’t have that white picket fence that we’re not allowed to live,” Cruz said. “And we don’t have any place to go.”
The flip side, local officials say, is a city dotted with tents and frustrated residents who feel they can’t use their public parks.
“I think there is a lot of crime happening in these parks,” Police Chief Warren Hensman said. “And I think our city — it deserves to have the ability to hold people accountable to bad behavior. ... I don’t think I or anybody else wants to make it difficult for somebody.”
Pointing to a nearby row of tents, he said: “We want to support, we want to help people, but the reality is, this in and of itself is inhumane.”
Grants Pass, like many cities, is also dealing with a housing shortage. Over the past two decades, as more people moved in, housing costs went up, forcing a growing number of people onto the streets.
According to the U.S. census, the population of Grants Pass was nearly 23,000 in 2000. It’s now nearly 40,000.
“I would be surprised if there are very many apartments that you could find for less than $1,200 a month in Grants Pass,” Ed Johnson, an Oregon Law Center attorney representing the city’s homeless residents, said in an interview. “It’s very difficult to find housing.”
The Grants Pass case arrived at the Supreme Court after the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the city’s homeless residents. The appeals court ruled 2-1 that the city, which is about 250 miles south of Portland, can’t “enforce its anti-camping ordinances against homeless persons for the mere act of sleeping outside with rudimentary protection from the elements, or for sleeping in their car at night, when there is no other place in the city for them to go.”
The decision applies only in situations in which homeless people “are engaging in conduct necessary to protect themselves from the elements when there is no shelter space available,” the court added.
Grants Pass appealed, and the Supreme Court decided to take it up.
Among those watching the outcome: California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who is among several Democrats who have called on the court to side with the city and against those arguing against any limits on outdoor camping.
“Encampments are dangerous — period. California is investing billions to build housing and provide the services needed to get people out of tents and into safer situations,” Newsom said in a statement. “However, our best efforts are being blocked because of sweeping injunctions that delay progress and fail to provide any consistent guidance for local authorities to abide by.”
Newsom filed an amicus brief supporting Grants Pass and arguing that rulings in other courts that have banned anti-camping ordinances have “paralyzed” cities and effectively blocked them from moving people off public streets.
Officials in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Phoenix are also among those asking the Supreme Court to overturn the appeals court ruling.
San Francisco, for instance, is embroiled in its own lawsuit over the clearing of homeless encampments. Mayor London Breed is asking a judge to freeze the lawsuit until the Grants Pass case is decided.
“It is a unique twist that this ruling is going to go to the Supreme Court, which is very conservative,” Sachin Agarwal, a co-founder of GrowSF, a group working to elect more moderate Democratic candidates in San Francisco, said in an interview. “We hope that they side with Grants Pass and that we are able to move people to shelter so we can have clean streets, which is good for families, it’s good for business, it’s good for the city.”
Johnson disagrees. He said lawmakers like Newsom and Breed are deflecting blame and siding with Grants Pass for political reasons under pressure from voters who are fed up with rising homelessness in their neighborhoods.
“Grants Pass wants to make it illegal on every inch of property, 24 hours a day,” Johnson said. “The problem is if that’s allowed, many cities will simply try to run all of the homeless people out of their community, and they have to go somewhere, so they’re going to go somewhere else, and they’re still going to have to live outside because of the affordable housing shortage.”
Johnson said that people are being punished for “simply existing” and that if more cities enact strict anti-camping ordinances like Grants Pass’, it could make the homelessness crisis worse.
“If we go down this line of spending money on criminalization and banishing people from their hometowns, we’re going to wake up in a year or two years or five years and we’re going to have twice as many of our neighbors living outside,” he said.
The city, however, argued that the anti-camping ordinances can help get people into shelters.
“The status quo is cruel. It is cruel and inhumane to allow encampments to proliferate,” said Grants Pass’ attorney Theane Evangelis, who will argue the case in front of the Supreme Court. “When cities are unable to address the situation, they’re unable to cite basic ordinances that can be used as a tool to help get people the services that they need, the help that they need, to break the cycle.”
A specific point of contention in Grants Pass is the lack of shelters.
The city directs people to the Gospel Rescue Mission, but the religious organization, which requires residents to work there, has a complicated list of rules that makes it unappealing for many, including those who are already employed.
In a statement to NBC News, Grants Pass Mayor Sara Bristol said the city has had to rely on nonprofits to offer shelters.
“We simply lack the financial resources to support a full-time shelter,” she said.
Residents like David Wilson, a veteran who is homeless in Grants Pass, said he can’t find a stable job or housing and has even been rejected by fast-food restaurants where he has applied.
Wilson said he once was fined $1,000 in three days for sleeping in his tent. He said he tried to use a housing voucher but no one would take it.
“I understand the problems they’re having. I just think they’re going about dealing with it in the wrong way,” he said. “So, fine, you get rid of me, you know, you drive us all out of town. There’s another wave coming.”
Cruz counts herself as one of the lucky ones. After she connected with a local pastor, she now lives at the small church across the street from the park where she once pitched her tent and found work cleaning homes. But she said she never forgets where she came from.
Her late friend Deborah Blake was one of the first homeless residents to challenge the city.
“One of the reasons that I stand up now is because I don’t want to see what she started — I want to see it finished in the right way,” Cruz said. “I believe what’s right is right and what’s wrong is wrong ... and what’s going on in this town right now is not right by any means.”
Wiping tears away, she paused and added: “If they side with the city of Grants Pass, I don’t really want to think about what’s going to happen. It’s an uncertainty that nobody wants to think about.”

2024-03-06T23:58:59.029Z,Dean Phillips ends presidential campaign and endorses Biden,NBC News,"Rep. Dean Phillips of Minnesota has suspended his campaign for the 2024 Democratic presidential nomination, ending his long-shot bid for the White House.
""I'm going to suspend my campaign and I will be, right now, endorsing President Biden because the choices are so clear,"" he said in a Minnesota radio interview on WCCO’s “The Chad Hartman Show.”
""The alternative, Donald Trump, is a very dangerous, dangerous man,"" he continued. ""I would simply ask and invite and encourage Haley supporters, Trump supporters, uncommitted supporters to unify behind decency and integrity.""
He said, ""That means supporting Joe Biden, and I’m going to do that beginning right now,"" adding that he's going to ""do everything humanly possible to ensure Joe Biden’s re-election this November because it’s that existential.""
Biden called Phillips after he suspended his White House bid, according to Katie Dolan, the former national press secretary for Phillips’ campaign. It wasn't clear what the two discussed or how long they spoke on Wednesday afternoon.
Biden later welcomed Phillips’ support on X.
“Dean, thanks for the kind words. And welcome to the team. We need you with us,” Biden wrote in response to a Phillips tweet endorsing Biden and praising his “empathy and kindness.”
Phillips, 55, launched his campaign challenging Biden in October. The three-term congressman said he had to run against the leader of his party because he argued Biden would lose to former President Donald Trump in the general election in November.
“I will not sit still, I will not be quiet in the face of numbers that are so clearly saying we’re going to be facing an emergency next November,” Phillips said in his announcement during an interview with CBS News last fall.
Speaking to NBC News' “Meet the Press” soon after, Phillips said, “Right now, if this election was held today, President Biden would lose, and it is an existential threat to the future of the United States of America. That will not happen under my watch.”
Phillips said that he wouldn’t “demean” or “undermine” Biden, though he criticized the president’s handling of the influx of migrants at the southern border. According to his campaign website, however, Phillips’ position on the issue seemed to align with Biden’s. It said he supports “enhanced border security, a pathway to citizenship for those here now, and a streamlined process for those seeking to enter the country legally.”
His views on other issues such as abortion and the economy also mirrored those of Biden’s.
His decision to drop out comes after he announced in November that he wouldn’t run for re-election to his House seat representing Minnesota’s 3rd Congressional District. Before Phillips entered the presidential race, a Democratic National Committee member, Ron Harris, said that he would run for Phillips’ House seat in 2024.
Phillips also made clear that while he was in the race he wouldn’t run for president as an independent.
The Minnesota Democrat did attract some support at the beginning of the primary season. A day before the New Hampshire primary, the state’s largest newspaper, the New Hampshire Union Leader, endorsed him for the Democratic ticket.
He and GOP presidential contender Nikki Haley were competing to gain the support of the same independent or undeclared voters in the state.
In the days leading up to the primary, Phillips spent time campaigning in New Hampshire, including in Nashua on Saturday, where he said Biden shouldn’t be running again — especially because he’s 81 years old.
“We all know Joe Biden is a good man. I respect him,” Phillips said. “But he should have passed the torch. He should not be running again. His age, yes, his stage of life. He’s in decline. We have very serious problems, costs, chaos, challenges facing this country in this world that I think are awfully difficult for either of these two men to address.”
In Rochester, New Hampshire, on Sunday, Phillips presented himself as the better candidate because he’s much younger. “Joe Biden has no relationships with this generation of new newly elected members of Congress,” he said.  “He hasn’t been in the Senate for many, many years.”
Phillips has served in the House since 2019 and is a member of the Bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus.

2024-03-12T02:39:58.889Z,Former Mar-a-Lago worker comes forward and describes moving materials in Trump classified docs case,NBC News,"A man who says he worked at Mar-a-Lago is going public with his recollection of events leading up to the FBI’s search of Donald Trump’s Florida residence over the former president's alleged mishandling of classified documents.
In a televised interview with CNN, Brian Butler said he helped Trump aide Walt Nauta load about 10 to 15 boxes onto Trump's plane at the West Palm Beach airport near his resort in June 2022, when representatives from the Justice Department were meeting with Trump and his attorneys about unreturned classified material.
Butler, whom CNN identified as “Trump Employee 5” in an indictment filed by special counsel Jack Smith, said in the interview that aired Monday that the boxes were “the boxes that were in the indictment, the white banker’s boxes,” referring to photos in the federal indictment.
Butler, who told CNN that he had worked at Trump’s Florida resort for two decades, declined a request for comment Monday. NBC News has not independently confirmed Butler’s identity as “Trump Employee 5,” one of the unnamed employees in the indictment.
Butler said in the interview that he was unaware that potentially classified material were in the boxes.
“I had no clue. I mean, we were just taking them out of the Escalade, piling them up,” Butler told CNN, adding that he told federal investigators about the movement of boxes. ""I remember they were all stacked on top of each other, and then we’re lifting them up to the pilots.”
Three months after the FBI search, Butler left his job as a club valet and manager at Mar-a-Lago in part because of a desire to move on, CNN reported.
When asked why he decided to speak out now, Butler called the past year a ""roller coaster"" and said he hoped that by going public ""at least I can move on with my life and get over this.""
""Instead of just waiting for it to just come out, I think it's better that I get to at least say what happened then it coming out in the news, people calling me, like, crazy,"" he said.
Butler said that he would be willing to testify during a trial.
The indictment alleged that in June 2022, Mar-a-Lago maintenance supervisor Carlos De Oliveira asked “Trump Employee 5” not to tell anyone about a trip by Nauta because Nauta “wanted the trip to remain secret.”
The indictment also alleged that De Oliveira told the employee that “Nauta wanted De Oliveira to talk to Trump Employee 4 to see how long camera footage was stored.”
NBC News has reported that “Employee 4” is Yuscil Taveras, and part of the superseding indictment suggests that Taveras may be cooperating with prosecutors. Prosecutors described a conversation in which they said De Oliveira told Taveras “that ‘the boss’ wanted the server deleted.”
The superseding indictment accused Trump of being part of a scheme to delete security video at Mar-a-Lago.
Neither De Oliveira’s legal team nor the Trump campaign immediately responded to requests for comment Monday about Butler’s interview. Nauta’s legal team and the office of Smith, the special counsel, declined to comment.
CNN reported that a lawyer for Trump declined to comment. A lawyer for De Oliveira told CNN, “We look forward to hearing more about Mr. Butler’s version of events when he is under oath and subject to penalty of perjury in the courtroom where that belongs, and we decline to try this case in the media.”
The charges against Trump include willful retention of national defense information. He and his two co-defendants — Nauta and De Oliveira — were also charged with conspiracy to obstruct justice.
The indictment was based in part on classified documents discovered when FBI agents searched Mar-a-Lago in August 2022.
Trump, Nauta and De Oliveira have all pleaded not guilty. The judge presiding over the case originally set the trial to start on May 20, though it is expected to be delayed.
Special counsel Robert Hur is set to testify Tuesday before a Republican-led House panel in a separate classified documents probe. Hur last month declined to prosecute President Joe Biden over his handling of classified material.

2024-03-12T20:58:21.498Z,"Republican Rep. Ken Buck is exiting Congress early, further eroding GOP majority",NBC News,"WASHINGTON — Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo., who frequently defied his own party and announced last fall he would not seek re-election, said Tuesday he will resign from Congress at the end of next week, further shrinking the GOP's already razor-thin majority.
""Today I am announcing that I will depart Congress at the end of next week,"" Buck said in a statement. ""I look forward to staying involved in our political process, as well as spending more time in Colorado and with my family.""
His departure will cut the House Republican margin to 218-213; Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., will continue to have two votes to spare before needing Democrats to govern. But illnesses and other unexpected absences could make his already difficult job even more challenging.
Buck said later that he was tired of the way the House functions now. ""We’ve taken impeachment and we’ve made it a social media issue as opposed to a constitutional concept. This place keeps going downhill and I don’t need to spend more time here,"" he said.
Speaking to reporters shortly after the news broke, Johnson suggested he did not get a heads-up from Buck.
""I was surprised by Ken’s announcement. I’m looking forward to talking with him about that,"" the speaker said.
But Buck said he did, in fact, inform Johnson, leaving a message for the speaker and discussing his departure with other members of leadership. ""Frankly, I’m not leaving for a week so they have a week to prepare,"" he said.
Other GOP colleagues said they were taken aback by Buck's decision. “Very surprising, very disturbing, very alarming, very concerning,"" said Rep. Pat Fallon, R-Texas.
Buck is a member of the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus, but he made a name for himself in Washington for frequently breaking with his party on major issues.
He criticized his fellow Republicans for echoing former President Donald Trump’s false claims that the 2020 election was stolen. He has expressed doubts that Republicans have found any evidence that President Joe Biden has committed an impeachable offense. And he faced multiple death threats from conservatives after refusing to back a key Trump ally, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, for speaker in October.
Most recently, Buck broke with his party and was one of three Republicans who voted against the impeachment of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas.
Buck referenced those votes when asked why he was making the GOP majority's job harder by decreasing its membership. ""I’m actually helping them in some ways because I’m not gonna vote against more impeachments,"" he said.
Buck's resignation will trigger a special election in Colorado. State law requires the seat to be filled through a special election, which needs to be called between 85 and 100 days after the vacancy occurs.
If Buck resigns on March 22, 85 days out would be June 15, so it’s possible that Democratic Gov. Jared Polis could schedule the election on the same day as Colorado’s congressional primary on June 25.
The state party committees nominate their special election candidates during a state convention, instead of holding a primary.
Multiple Republicans, including Rep. Lauren Boebert, have already announced bids for Buck’s seat in 2024.
First elected to the House in 2014, Buck got his start in politics in the mid-1980s working for then-Rep. Dick Cheney, R-Wyo., on the committee investigating the Iran-Contra affair. Soon after, he was hired as a prosecutor in the Justice Department which is now the target of vicious attacks from Trump and his party.

2024-03-06T20:47:07.382Z,'A clarion call': Democratic donors sound the alarm to Biden about strength of 'uncommitted',NBC News,"A network of major Democratic donors is raising the alarm about Joe Biden’s performance in Michigan, calling the traction of “uncommitted” in last week’s Democratic presidential primary a “wake-up call” for the president in the critical battleground state.
In a memo to donors shared with NBC News by a recipient, Way to Win, the network of deep-pocketed progressives, urged members to “not try to argue ourselves out of the fact that Michigan is a major warning signal that something needs to change”
“Michigan’s 100,000+ uncommitted voters in 2024 are a siren, and a clarion call,” wrote Way to Win’s co-founders, Tory Gavito and Jenifer Fernandez Ancona. “The energy behind ‘uncommitted’ is not something that should be ignored, taken lightly, or dismissed as isolated to Michigan. Michigan 2024 is not an anomaly, just as Michigan 2016 was not.”
While Biden won a resounding 81% of the vote in the Feb. 27 Democratic primary, about 13% voted “uncommitted,” largely over concerns about Biden’s support for Israel in its war in Gaza.
On Super Tuesday, thousands more Democrats voted for either “uncommitted” or “no preference” in six other states.
In Minnesota, “Uncommitted” received 19% of the overall vote, where activists mounted a last-minute campaign based on the Michigan blueprint and far surpassed their public goals. The “Listen to Minnesota” campaign noted that the strongest support for uncommitted came in areas with significant young voter turnout.
“Tonight, Minnesota proved to the country that the ‘Uncommitted’ movement is not going away nor is it slowing down,” said Listen to Michigan campaign manager Layla Elabed after Tuesday’s results.
Polls show former President Donald Trump leading Biden nationally and in many battleground states as the war in Gaza has heightened dissent for Biden among young people, Muslim and progressive voters inside the Democratic Party.
In a tight race — Trump won Michigan by fewer than 11,000 votes in 2016 — even a relatively small number of voters staying home or voting third party could be decisive.
Like some Michigan Democrats, Way to Win, which has moved more than $300 million in political contributions since its founding in response to Trump’s election, urged Biden to change course on Gaza, elevate Vice President Kamala Harris and do more to curb third-party candidates.
“Biden is the nominee and we are 100% behind the Biden-Harris ticket and are doing everything in our power to help inspire and mobilize the multiracial and multigenerational coalition we need to win,” Gavito said in a statement to NBC News when asked about the memo. “We wrote this memo because we need to unify our winning coalition, and that has to start now.”
Anxious Democrats note that 2016 nominee Hillary Clinton was caught off guard when Bernie Sanders beat her in Michigan’s primary that year, despite polls showing her ahead, but her team nonetheless headed into the general election thinking Michigan’s and other Great Lakes states were safe.
The Biden campaign, however, has been working to reassure fellow Democrats that they are clear-eyed about their challenges and working to address them.
The campaign just opened its first field office in Michigan, and the president is expected to launch a campaign swing through battleground states after Thursday’s State of the Union address.
“We’ve got energy heading into November. But we also have work to do,” Rep. Haley Stevens, D-Mich., said at an office opening in Madison Heights. “We’re not going to deny that some people sat their vote out. We want to bring them back in the fold. Joe Biden was made for this moment of listening, bringing people in, leading with heart, compassion and grace.”
And Harris over the weekend notably went further than Biden, rhetorically at least, in calling for a cease-fire in Gaza, as she wages a behind-the-scenes push for other administration officials to speak more forcefully about the humanitarian situation there.
“The President believes making your voice heard and participating in our democracy is fundamental to who we are as Americans. He shares the goal for an end to the violence and a just, lasting peace in the Middle East. He’s working tirelessly to that end,” Biden campaign spokesperson Lauren Hitt told NBC News.
Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., who has not been shy about voicing her concerns to Biden’s high command, said the November election will come down to which party can get more of their voters to the polls.
“It’s going to be a turnout election,” she said on NBC News’ ""Meet the Press.""
Dingell, who lived in Dearborn, a Democratic city with a large Muslim population where “uncommitted” earned 57% of the primary vote, said that while overall turnout for “uncommitted” was not much higher than the norm, the war in Gaza is visceral for many.
“It is one issue that needs to be paid attention to. I got a lot of people that are hurting in my district, and in the district that I used to represent,” she said. “ I have families that have lost 40 members of one family. ... They’re going to be an important group in November, but there’s a lot of other groups that we have to make sure turn out.”
By moving Michigan’s presidential primary up into its new early voting window, Biden advisers hoped to highlight his strength among key voting coalitions: Black voters, union workers and suburban women.
The strength of the “uncommitted” protest vote there, though, instead highlighted the challenges Biden faces with other key groups whose turnout — or lack thereof — could be significant in November: young voters, progressives and Muslim and Arab Americans.
On college campuses and downtowns, protests against the war in Gaza have been fierce and frequent, often portraying Biden as a villain and dubbing him “Genocide Joe.”
Kevin Tolbert, the chair of the 12th Congressional District Democrats, which includes part of Dearborn and Detroit, said there could be lasting damage from that kind of rhetoric.
“I don’t know if people can forget in November what they heard here in late February, and it takes a lot of work,” Tolbert said. “I’d love to see more of the Biden campaign here. This is ground zero.”
To be sure, Democrats note Trump faces his own challenges uniting his party and is unlikely to do the kind of conciliatory outreach that Biden’s team will.
Unite the Country, a pro-Biden super PAC, did intensive research on disaffected voters — those who disapprove of both Biden and Trump — in key states. In Michigan, that group was primarily female, independent and lived in the Detroit region or near Grand Rapids, where support for Trump challenger Nikki Haley was higher than the statewide margin.
“If just a handful of those Haley voters vote for Biden, which isn’t a stretch, Trump’s math in Michigan gets really tight,” said the super PAC’s leader, Steve Schale.
The Biden campaign likewise pointed to what they called “soft” support for Trump in suburban areas, while they were buoyed by strong Black support in places like Southfield, just outside Detroit. Despite strong uncommitted support in some places, like Dearborn, the statewide turnout for “uncommitted” was only marginally higher than the historical norm for Democratic presidents running for re-election.
They also noted that Biden’s vote share in Michigan was three times the turnout for the last noncompetitive state primary, in 2012.
And there were six other states on Super Tuesday that had ""uncommitted"" or similar options, and they gained little traction outside Minnesota and Massachusetts.
Biden's team acknowledged, though, that the campaign has work to do to ensure the kind of strong support from young voters that they saw in 2020. An adviser noted that the campaign brought on a full-time Youth Engagement Director in January, which they said was the earliest for a major presidential campaign, and that team is already expanding.
And Biden allies note that he has dominated the primaries that have been held so far, earning 81% to 97% of the vote when his name was on the ballot and even getting 61% as a write-in in New Hampshire.
“There has been senior officials that have gone to Michigan, as recently as earlier this month, to hear directly from the Muslim and Arab American community,"" said White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. ""And we understand how personal this is, how this moment is incredibly painful. And we’re going to continue to have those conversations.”

2024-03-12T19:11:48.415Z,White House to provide $300 million weapons package for Ukraine,NBC News,"The White House will provide $300 million in additional weapons to Ukraine, officials announced Tuesday, as more funding remains held up in Congress by Republican leaders.
The package will be made available through presidential drawdown authority, or PDA, which pulls weapons from existing U.S. stockpiles. The military equipment headed to Ukraine includes anti-aircraft missiles, ammunition, artillery rounds and anti-armor systems, the officials said.
The announcement comes as the Ukrainian military is facing dire weapons shortages in its two-year war with Russia.
“When Russian troops advance and its guns fire, Ukraine does not have enough ammunition to fire back,” national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in announcing the new aid package.
At the same time, the U.S. has ""basically exhausted our funding to assist Ukraine,"" a senior defense official said.
Defense officials said they were able to come up with the funding through savings in long-term contracts with weapons makers, but they described it as a one-time arrangement.
The military has been forced to come up with creative ways to pay for weapons packages for Ukraine because of the impasse in Congress. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has refused to bring  a bill to the floor that would provide $60 billion in additional aid for Ukraine.
The last supplemental funding package was in December 2022. The U.S. sent $200 million in aid to Ukraine this past December, but it was funded with money from the previous year.
It was not immediately clear if the latest weapons package included long-range ballistic missiles.
NBC News reported last month that the Pentagon was considering giving Ukraine urgent weapons, including the powerful missiles, without waiting for Congress to approve funds.
Two defense officials said at the time that the U.S. has a limited inventory of Army Tactical Missile Systems, known as ATACMS, and that it is not likely to send them to Ukraine without money to replenish U.S. stockpiles.
The U.S. began to supply Ukraine with older medium-range ATACMS late last year. The longer-range version of the missile would allow Ukraine to strike farther inside the Russian-held Crimean Peninsula.
In recent months, Russian forces have gained ground in Ukraine, and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has stepped up his pleas for additional military aid, saying his army is in desperate need of ammunition and other weapons.

2024-03-06T19:31:11.542Z,Trump co-defendant's lawyer presents argument for disqualifying Fani Willis to Georgia state senators,NBC News,"In a lengthy hearing before a George Senate committee Wednesday, the defense attorney who first alleged a personal relationship Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis and special prosecutor Nathan Wade walked lawmakers through how she came to find out about their romance.
The Republican chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Investigations, Bill Cowsert, questioned Ashleigh Merchant, the defense attorney for Michael Roman, a Trump co-defendant who was charged in Fulton County’s election interference case, for several hours. The panel had subpoenaed Merchant for her testimony.
“We’re tasked with investigating and finding the true facts,” Cowsert said, explaining why the committee was holding the hearing. He added that the committee is tasked, if necessary, with amending or creating new statutes “to build guardrails” to “restore the public faith in our criminal justice system.”
The Senate committee does not have any power to disqualify Willis from prosecuting the election interference case. It was the first in what is expected to be a series of hearings investigating Willis for the potential misuse of state funds or power for personal gain.
Merchant reiterated that she wants Willis to be disqualified, alleging a conflict of interest as a result of Willis’ and Wade’s relationship, which they recently said in court had ended last summer. Merchant specifically argued that Willis should not have hired Wade as a special prosecutor in the election interference case, claiming it violated county policy on nepotism and relationships. And she again alleged that Willis benefited from the appointment by accepting trips Wade paid for.
Merchant alleges that their romantic relationship began before Willis appointed him as a special prosecutor in November 2021. The former couple, however, have denied that accusation and have said it began in early 2022.
Merchant testified Wednesday that Wade’s former law partner and former divorce lawyer, Terrence Bradley, first told her that Willis and Wade were in a relationship. She said data she obtained from cellphone pinging showed there were 12,000 voice and text interactions between them in 2021.
Merchant alleged that Willis had received extra funding for homicides and Covid backlogs but used at least part of that funding on the election case, instead. She claimed that Willis hired Wade in such a way as to avoid oversight and then paid him more than other, more experienced special prosecutors.
She also said that Wade had offered her client, Roman, a plea offer of a $5,000 fine and a misdemeanor but that they did not accept it.
The only other lawmaker who questioned Merchant on Wednesday was Democratic Sen. Harold V. Jones II. He expressed skepticism about Merchant’s argument for disqualifying Willis, saying that case she cited in a court motion contradicted points she made Wednesday.
Jones said the court said in that case, “What you have to show is there’s an actual unfairness to the defendant in the trial,” referring to Roman. “Can you point to any unfairness in the trial that’s taken place?”
Merchant rejected the question and said her argument is that there is a conflict of interest because Willis and Wade were “sleeping together, and he was paying for trips for them to go on, and they were hiding it from the taxpayers.”
Speaking to reporters at the Capitol building Wednesday, Willis called the committee hearing a ""political quest.""
""People are angry because I’m going to do the right thing and stand up for justice. ... They can continue their games, and I’ll continue to do the work of the people,"" she said.
Asked whether she would appear before the committee if called, Willis said she would consult with her lawyer.
The subpoena directed Merchant to bring various documents, including the history of her texts with Bradley.
While the panel has subpoena power, it does not have the authority to discipline Willis. If its members find wrongdoing, they could either refer the case to proper governing authorities, including a newly approved prosecutor oversight panel, or recommend new laws.
Cowsert said that the investigation will take “many months” to complete and that there will be more subpoenas.
Asked specifically about a subpoena of Willis, Cowsert said, “I don’t know yet.”
The judge overseeing the election interference case, Scott McAfee, recently heard testimony from Willis and Wade and other witnesses as part of the effort to disqualify Willis from prosecuting the case. McAfee said Friday that he would decide within two weeks.

2024-03-08T04:14:11.741Z,Judge denies Trump's request for more time to pay damages in Carroll defamation case,NBC News,"A federal judge on Thursday rejected Donald Trump’s request for three extra days to pay damages in writer E. Jean Carroll’s defamation case against the former president.
The payment's scheduled due date is Monday. Trump was ordered to pay $83.3 million, and with interest the full amount will be $91.6 million.
U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan, who presided over the trial in New York, said Trump has had plenty of time to arrange for payment in the weeks since a jury in January found him liable for defamation by denying that he sexually abused Carroll in the ’90s in a dressing room at the Bergdorf Goodman department store in Manhattan.
“Mr. Trump’s current situation is a result of his own dilatory actions,” Kaplan wrote in his order. “He has had since January 26 to organize his finances with the knowledge that he might need to bond this judgment.”
A campaign spokesman for Trump blasted the order in a statement Thursday.
""This a continuation of a totally lawless Witch Hunt. President Trump filed a timely motion to stay the ridiculous judgment, and many courts, including the Second Circuit, recognize the importance of temporary administrative stays while such motions are considered,"" said Steven Cheung. ""We look forward to continuing to litigate the case and to complete vindication of the Truth.”
On Wednesday, Trump attorney Alina Habba asked Kaplan to pause enforcing the verdict until three business days after the court rules on a longer-term stay in an effort to get ahead of Monday's deadline finalizing the judgment.
Trump last month sought a longer pause in enforcement of the verdict, pending resolution of his post-trial motions. Kaplan has yet to rule on that request.
Trump's attorneys filed for a new trial in the case Tuesday and requested that Kaplan substantially reduce the judgment. They contended that the jury’s compensatory and punitive awards were out of proportion and argued that the $11 million award for reputational harm “is disproportionately high” compared to awards in similar cases.

2024-03-11T21:45:29.740Z,Trump opens the door to attacks over Social Security and Medicare: From the Politics Desk,NBC News,"Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team’s latest reporting and analysis from the campaign trail, the White House and Capitol Hill.
In today’s edition, senior national political reporter Sahil Kapur notes how Donald Trump has opened himself up to attacks on Social Security and Medicare. Plus, senior political editor Mark Murray explains why Joe Biden is ramping up his campaign activity this week.
Donald Trump stepped right into a debate Monday that Joe Biden is eager to have.
Trump, who had attacked his GOP primary opponents for wanting to spend less on entitlement programs, opened the door to “cutting” Social Security and Medicare during an interview on CNBC.
“So first of all, there is a lot you can do in terms of entitlements, in terms of cutting,” Trump said when pressed about his plan for resolving the programs’ long-term solvency problems. He went on to blast “bad management.”
Do you have a news tip? Let us know
Trump didn’t specify what he would cut, but the Biden campaign rapidly swooped in to share the remarks on social media, saying: “Not on my watch.”
A few hours later, Biden tore into Trump during a speech in the battleground state of New Hampshire. “If anyone tries to cut Social Security or Medicare, or raise the retirement age again, I will stop them,” the president said. “This morning, Donald Trump said cuts to Social Security and Medicare are on the table again.”
Trump’s campaign sought to clean up his remarks, telling NBC News he only meant “cutting waste and fraud.” Trump spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt also circulated a statement claiming that Biden is the real threat to the two programs, claiming that his “mass invasion of countless millions of illegal aliens will, if they are allowed to stay, cause Social Security and Medicare to buckle and collapse.”
Democrats see a big opportunity here to strike a populist tone, as the party that created Social Security and Medicare and has been historically unified in protecting the programs, and as Biden seeks to boost his sagging poll numbers. Progressives cheered Biden for taking the offensive over the issue, and they’ve called on him to champion Social Security expansion.
Republicans are more divided, with many calling for addressing future red ink by reducing long-term benefits with policies like raising the retirement age and using a lower rate of inflation. Biden has emphatically ruled out benefit cuts. In his new White House budget released Monday, he identified some specific tax increases on upper earners and on net investment income to resolve the long-term shortfalls.
Trump has positioned himself against conservative orthodoxy on cutting entitlements, but he hasn’t identified a plan. His campaign didn’t answer questions from NBC News about how he’d shore up the programs, whether tax increases are on the table and how much he would save by cutting waste and fraud.
Last week was a big one for Biden with his State of the Union address.
But whether he can move poll numbers in his direction in the early stages of the general election could make this week big, too, as he ramps up his campaign activity.
Just look at this week’s schedule: The president was in New Hampshire on Monday to discuss lower health care costs and for a campaign event. On Tuesday, Biden is set to hold a campaign meeting with Teamsters members as he seeks the union’s endorsement. He will travel to two more battleground states, Wisconsin and Michigan, on Wednesday and Thursday. And at the White House, he is scheduled to meet with the leaders of Poland on Tuesday and the prime minister of Ireland on Friday ahead of St. Patrick’s Day.
Then there’s the activity over the airwaves, with Biden touting his administration’s policies and even discussing his age, lightheartedly, in a new 60-second TV ad. “Look, I’m not a young guy. That’s no secret,” the 81-year-old president says to the camera. “But here’s the deal: I understand how to get things done for the American people.”
And over the weekend, the president sat down for an interview with MSNBC’s Jonathan Capehart and said that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is “hurting Israel” and that he regretted calling the man charged with killing Laken Riley an “illegal” in his State of the Union speech.
This stepped-up activity comes after Biden received criticism for not having a vigorous schedule and robust public presence. In fact, Biden has conducted fewer news conferences and media interviews than any of his recent predecessors.
It also comes as special counsel Robert Hur is set to testify Tuesday before the House Judiciary Committee on his findings in his investigation into Biden’s handling of classified documents. Hur declined to charge Biden with a crime, but also concluded that the president had “willfully retained and disclosed classified materials” and called him an “elderly man with a poor memory” — a description Biden and his allies disputed.
And it comes as polling eight months before the general election finds Biden (at best) running even with Trump and (at worst) trailing the former president, albeit usually within the margin of error.
The big question: Does this ramped-up activity by Biden — more events, new TV ads, a sit-down interview — translate into a stronger poll position, even at the margins?

2024-03-14T13:36:46.052Z,"TikTok ban's fate is uncertain in the Senate, where there is less urgency to act",NBC News,"WASHINGTON — The House-passed bill that could ban TikTok faces an uncertain future in the Senate, where there is less urgency to act and senators have different theories about how to address national security concerns about the app's China-based owner.
Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said he sees a need for action on TikTok because of its parent company's links to China.
“I certainly think it is a threat,” he said before the House vote. “Because under existing Chinese law any information any Chinese company collects, they have to share with the Chinese Communist Party. So it’s well documented that one of the strategies that Communist China has is to collect all this data and apply their artificial intelligence to do mass surveillance, and more.”
He added that the Senate won't act as quickly as the House did.
“We do things slowly over here, and this takes time,” Cornyn said.
The chamber will require 60 votes to break a filibuster, and senators have a range of concerns. Many say the national security threat posed by TikTok is urgent, and some are willing to support the House bill. Others want a broader approach that encompasses various foreign-controlled apps rather than targeting one company. Yet others worry that China will seek to retaliate against the U.S.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., was noncommittal on whether the Senate would vote on the House bill, telling reporters Tuesday, “I’ll have to consult, and intend to consult, with my relevant committee chairmen to see what their views would be.”
Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Mark Warner, D-Va., and leading Republican Marco Rubio of Florida said in a joint statement Wednesday that they were ""encouraged"" by the bipartisan House vote, adding that they'll work together ""to get this bill passed through the Senate and signed into law.""
Another key chair, Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., who leads the Senate Commerce Committee, said, “I’m not sure what we’ll do yet, got to talk to lots of people.”
“The whole point here is you have a dilemma,” Cantwell said. “You want free speech, but you also want the United States to have some ability to protect U.S. citizens or U.S. military from foreign actors who might be deleterious in what they would be using as a tool of communication. So we want to get a tool to those people, whether that’s the Department of Commerce or DOJ, so that they can sustain those actions.”
Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., the Judiciary Committee chair, acknowledged that a ban on TikTok may not be politically beneficial for President Joe Biden’s re-election in November. The Biden campaign joined TikTok last month to meet voters ""where they are,"" though the president has said he would sign the ban legislation if it passes both chambers of Congress.
“Cutting out a large group of young voters is not the best-known strategy for re-election,” Durbin said.
“They love TikTok; I know that from my own grandkids and others. And it’s part of their lifestyle and they don’t want to lose it,” he added.
TikTok has warned about ""the impact on the economy, 7 million small businesses, and the 170 million Americans who use our service,"" calling the bill a ""ban"" that was ""jammed through"" the House.
But concerns about China potentially accessing U.S. users' data through TikTok or spreading content on the app to influence Americans' views have resonated with many members of Congress.
Supporters of the bill dismiss the term “ban,” saying that would only happen if TikTok's China-based owner, ByteDance, refuses to divest the social media app. The bill would create a process for the president to deem a social media app under the control of a foreign adversary as a national security threat and then ban it from U.S. app stores within six months unless the app severs ties with that country.
Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said that he’d be “inclined to support” the House bill and that recent security briefings appear to have moved lawmakers toward restricting TikTok.
“The more we know, the more frightening TikTok becomes,” he said. “Not just in terms of its effect on young people, with the TikTok challenge and all the bad stuff out there, but the data collection and surveillance that’s ongoing. The dark side of the moon is bigger than we thought.”
Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., said he’s worried that China could try to retaliate on U.S. firms.
“I’m sympathetic to what they’re trying to accomplish. I think my main concern is to make sure that we think it through,” Tillis said. “We have to keep in mind that some of the true giants in this space are U.S.-based firms. And we can think about China’s retaliation; that’s one thing I worry about.”
“I’m not overly concerned with TikTok’s well-being because I think China is in their DNA,” Tillis added. “So maybe they should take actions themselves so that we don’t have to.”
Asked about the bill before the House vote, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin pushed back on the bill and congressional rhetoric Wednesday, telling reporters that the U.S. lacks ""evidence proving TikTok poses a threat to U.S. national security"" and accusing Americans of ""resorting to bullying tactics when unable to win in fair competition.""
ByteDance is subject to Chinese law that requires it to hand over information if asked by the government, which could include TikTok user data.
Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said he vociferously objects to a TikTok ban, citing First and Fifth Amendment concerns.
""The lengths some in Congress will go to for more authority and control over Americans’ freedom of speech never ceases to amaze me,"" Paul tweeted.
He earned a response on X from Elon Musk: “Sounds like there is much more to be concerned about in this bill than who owns TikTok!”
Paul told NBC News he has strong constitutional concerns about the bill.
“180 million Americans use it; you can’t just take away the right to express themselves because you don’t like a company,” he said. “Fifth Amendment says you can’t take someone’s property without due process. And a bill of attainder says you can’t write legislation against one person or one company. Those are pretty strong arguments.”
“It’s based on a hysteria of banning everything China, which I think isn’t good,” he added.
Democratic Sens. Chris Murphy of Connecticut and Ed Markey of Massachusetts, who have both used TikTok, said they’d rather see Congress tackle legislation that protects children online than focus on banning one social media platform.
“Any discussion about TikTok has to involve all the other companies who are targeting all these teenagers and causing the biggest mental health crisis in our country’s history,” Markey said.
TikTok has “some great things for kids and it’s got some really terrible things for kids,” Murphy said. “I would much rather regulate the social media industry to protect kids rather than ban one particular technology.”
Murphy added that he hasn’t made a decision on whether he’ll support the House’s bill, but said he’s open to it.
Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., joked with reporters that TikTok has made him spend too much money at Sephora for his daughter, calling the app “trash.”
“I’ve spent hundreds of dollars on Drunk Elephant at Sephora because of my tween, and that’s annoying,” he said.
Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., predicted Congress would act on TikTok.
“I think it’ll be banned,” he said. “It’s toxic.”

2024-03-11T10:00:40.000Z,"Conservatives are furious, but they're not threatening Speaker Johnson's job",NBC News,"WASHINGTON — House conservatives are furious about the government funding bill negotiated by Speaker Mike Johnson that sailed through Congress last week, calling it a betrayal of Republican promises to cut spending and reshape the federal budget.
But in a twist, this time they aren’t threatening to overthrow the man in charge of cutting those funding deals with a Democratic-led Senate and White House, even as they’ve begun to paint him as a functionary for status quo policies.
House Freedom Caucus Chair Bob Good, R-Va., has blasted the first of two funding packages and said he doesn’t expect a better deal in the second one, which must pass by March 22 to avoid a partial government shutdown.
“Because the speaker doesn’t want to do that. He just wants to pass what the Senate wants so that we avoid any conflict,” Good told NBC News, saying that Johnson, R-La., wants to “join hands with the Dems” to “increase spending” and yield “no policy wins.”
“The speaker is unwilling to tell the Senate no,” he said. “It doesn’t matter what we offer.”
But Good didn’t have a solution when asked what the right flank can do about it, saying: “I’m open to ideas.”
When asked pointedly if that includes a motion to vacate the speaker’s chair, Good, one of eight Republicans who used the tool to oust former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, ended the conversation. “Thank you,” he replied.
The shift in mindset indicates that reality is setting in for a band of fiery rabble-rousers who came into the new Republican majority with high expectations of bending Congress to their will. The right-wing members continue to believe that a small House GOP majority can force the Democratic-led Senate and White House to accede to their wishes, but they’re slowly recognizing that many of their Republican colleagues don’t support the aggressive spending cuts they want. And they’re beginning to doubt that any speaker can change that.
Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, a Freedom Caucus member and right-wing thought leader on fiscal policy, said the newly passed government funding bill was “more of the same games, a lot of smoke and mirrors.” And he predicted the next package of bills will similarly be “garbage.”
“It is business as usual,” Roy said, despite some “modest strides” toward a more normal process in developing the bills.
But when asked if he blames Johnson, Roy said, “I think the speaker reflects a conference that likes to give lip service to fiscal restraint and refuses to act on it. That’s what I think.”
As for a motion to vacate? Roy isn’t going there: “I think it’s a tool that should always be on the table, as an historical matter. I think it should be sparingly used. ... I think we need to just keep working forward to try to get somewhere.”
Rep. Troy Nehls, R-Texas, an ardent Donald Trump ally who wore a T-shirt with the former president’s mug shot to the State of the Union address, was more blunt about why Johnson’s job isn’t in danger: Nobody wants it.
“Let’s just go down to Disney and see if Daffy Duck or maybe Goofy would want the job,” Nehls said. “Maybe Mickey! Maybe Mickey would want the job.”
Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., another Freedom Caucus member, doesn’t blame Johnson for spending bills he dubbed “irresponsible,” and said that a motion to vacate isn’t on the table.
“He inherited a lot of this. No, I don’t blame him,” Norman said. “It’s like herding cats up here.”
McCarthy, R-Calif., passed one short-term government funding bill as speaker, and the far right took away his gavel within days. His successor,  Johnson, has passed three stopgap bills and a major appropriations package that falls short of their demands.
Norman said the two situations are different because McCarthy and Johnson operate differently.
“McCarthy had a lot of other issues other than that. He would tell us one thing of the top line, and then he had side deals. That was not right. Johnson, to his credit, does not do that,” Norman said.
Roy said things haven’t changed much since Johnson replaced McCarthy, starting with the spending bill that just passed.
“We know it’s going to spend more money than the [Nancy] Pelosi omnibus,” Roy said. “And all these little cuts, like the FBI — that was one building in Alabama!”
The FBI faces a 6% cut relative to 2023. But almost all of it comes from the “construction” part of the budget, which sources said was previously boosted by the now-retired Senate Appropriations Vice Chair Richard Shelby, R-Ala., for a project in his home state. Just 0.3% is cut from the FBI’s main “salaries and expenses” budget.
“There’s no cut,” Roy said. “Just admit it!”
Democrats are pleased to see Johnson side with the majority of his conference and against the far right on funding the government.
“I think people have come to realize that you come here to govern. We come here to do the work of the American people,” said Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., the top House Democratic appropriator.
They say he should do the same on aid for Ukraine and allow a bipartisan bill to come up.
“The speaker said that the House should do this. Well, we have a security package out there that he could put on the floor too, if he wants the House to do it,” said Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Wash., the chair of the House Democratic campaign arm. “Well? Let us vote.”
Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., had threatened to remove Johnson through a motion to vacate if he brought funding for Ukraine to the House floor, calling it “an absolute no-go.” But she’s since sought to clarify her threat, saying it only applies if he brings up the Senate bill that includes Ukraine funding and border security.
“It wasn’t a stand-alone threat on Ukraine funding,” she said.

2024-03-08T19:04:21.417Z,Kamala Harris won’t say whether she or Biden will participate in presidential debates,NBC News,"WASHINGTON — Vice President Kamala Harris wouldn't say Friday whether President Joe Biden will participate in general election debates against former President Donald Trump, and she also wouldn't commit to a vice presidential debate herself.
In an interview with NBC News chief White House correspondent, Peter Alexander, Harris said she hasn't spoken to the president about the possibility of him debating Trump, but said it would be a stark ""split screen.""
“On the one hand, you’ve got Joe Biden — someone who is competent, who is principled, who has accomplished more than many presidents even hoped for ... on infrastructure, on climate, on health care,” Harris said. “On the other side of that split screen, you’ve got the former president, who glorifies dictators and has said he’ll be a dictator on day one. Someone who has said that he will weaponize the Department of Justice against his political enemies. Someone who said he’s proud of the fact that he had picked three members of the United States Supreme Court, who took a constitutional right from the women of America to make decisions about their own body.”
“The split screen is clear,” she said, adding that the choice of debating Trump will be “decided upon soon.”
Asked if she would commit to participating in a debate this fall against the Republican vice presidential nominee, who has not yet been chosen, Harris said: ""We just got through the State of the Union. And I’m just so excited about what we accomplished last night and our president.""
Trump said Wednesday — a day after the Super Tuesday primaries — that he would debate Biden ""anytime, anywhere, anyplace."" The former president had also expressed the same thing in early February, saying he wanted to debate Biden ""immediately.""
“Immediately?"" Biden told reporters at the time when asked whether he would agree to Trump’s challenge. ""Well, if I were him, I’d want to debate me, too. He’s got nothing else to do.""
In 2022, however, the Republican National Committee decided to withdraw from presidential debates set up by the nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates. The RNC said it would require GOP presidential candidates to instead pledge to only participate in debates sanctioned by the Republican Party.
Trump said that the commission was “corrupt,” claiming someone turned off his microphone during a general election debate in 2016. The organization decided during the 2020 campaign that it would cut off Trump’s microphone while Biden was answering a question, and vice versa.
The Commission on Presidential Debates announced last year the dates and locations for three 2024 general election debates: Sept. 16 at Texas State University in San Marcos; Oct. 1 at Virginia State University in Petersburg; and Oct. 9 at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City.
During the interview Friday, Harris was asked if Biden addressed Americans’ questions about his age during his State of the Union address Thursday night.
“He was absolutely on fire and he answered any question that anyone might have about how passionate he is, how prepared he is, how principled he is, to take on a second term as president and I thought that he did a spectacular job,” she said, adding that Biden “dispelled” any questions and concerns about his age and mental fitness with his “vigor and passion last night.”
On the conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, Harris reiterated Biden’s message from his speech that Israel has a right to defend itself after the Oct. 7 attack, but innocent Palestinians have suffered as well.
“We need a cease-fire for six weeks so that we can get the hostages out, get aid in,” she said. “I’ve been very clear, as has the president — that ultimately not only do we all want this conflict to end, but we have got to be committed to a two-state solution,” she said.
Asked why the president won’t take executive action to address the crisis involving migrants at the southern border, Harris placed the blame on congressional Republicans for not accepting multiple border security proposals since Biden took office.
“We have a lot of work to be done, but let us not negate the role and responsibility of leaders in Congress who have been elected to be in Washington, D.C. to fix problems. We know there is a broken system...we have an opportunity to fix it  and they’re playing political games, and we cannot overlook the significance of that.”

2024-03-06T18:07:09.886Z,The Super Tuesday races that remain uncalled around the country,NBC News,"Most of the big Super Tuesday primaries have clear winners at this point — but a handful of close races are still in limbo as of Wednesday morning.
They include a pair of key swing seats in the race for the House, a major proxy battle between different wings of the Republican Party, the fight over who will replace former Speaker Kevin McCarthy in the House and a number of other important races.
Here’s a look at the key races around the country where the NBC News Decision Desk hasn’t yet projected a winner. This collection of notable House primaries is concentrated in California, where wide adoption of mail voting and a long post-election processing period often lead to slow counting of votes.
Republican Rep. David Valadao’s re-election race in the Central Valley could be one of the most competitive battles in the entire House in 2024 — unless Republicans are able to shut out Democrats from making the general ballot. That’s the intrigue in this seat, where there’s no projection with half the vote in.
California’s nonpartisan primary puts every candidate on the same ballot, with the top two moving on to a general election regardless of party. In this district, Valadao is leading the pack with 34% support, followed by former Democratic Assemblyman Rudy Salas at 28%, former Fresno City Councilman Chris Mathys, a Republican, at 22% and Democratic state Sen. Melissa Hurtado at 15%.
Democrats knocked off Valadao in 2018, only to see him come back in 2020 and win again in 2022. But if he and Mathys are the ones who advance, Democrats won’t even get the chance to flip the seat this cycle.
Republican Mark Harris is running for Congress again, six years after the election following a previous congressional campaign was tossed out, with one of Harris’ consultants accused of widespread ballot fraud. At the time, Harris ultimately agreed with the decision to order a new election, but he’s now running by painting himself as the victim.
In North Carolina, a first-place candidate can win a primary outright as long as they eclipse 30% of the vote — but if no candidate hits that threshold, the top two finishers move on to a runoff. Harris is currently dancing right on that line, at 30.4% support, with 97% of the expected vote in.
Outside groups funded by establishment-aligned Republican megadonors have spent about $2 million against Harris, who has been backed by the political arm of the right-wing House Freedom Caucus. The winner of the GOP primary will be heavily favored to join Congress next year, given the Republican lean of the district.
A crowded group of predominantly Republican candidates are looking to replace former Speaker Kevin McCarthy in the House, after he resigned late last year following his ouster from the speakership.
NBC News’ Decision Desk projects that Republican state Assemblyman Vince Fong — who is backed by McCarthy and former President Donald Trump, among others — will move on to the general election. But there’s no projection on his opponent yet with about half the vote. Republican Tulare County Sheriff Mike Boudreaux and Democratic teacher Marisa Wood are far and away the next highest vote-getters, meaning two very different types of general election contests are possible.
The race to replace Democratic Rep. Colin Allred in the House, as he leaves his blue district to run for Senate, is also one that hinges on a state runoff rule. In Texas, the top two primary candidates compete in a runoff unless the first-place finisher exceeds 50% support. And state Rep. Julie Johnson sits at 50.4% of the Democratic primary vote, with 99% in.
Johnson, who is backed by a handful of key progressive groups and state lawmakers, will move onto the general election and be the prohibitive favorite to win a House seat if she stays above 50%. But if not, she’ll likely slip into a runoff against Brian Williams, a trauma surgeon who has been a vocal proponent of new gun laws and has been backed by prominent gun-safety groups.
Democratic Rep. Barbara Lee is leaving her Bay Area seat open after making an unsuccessful Senate bid. While NBC News projects that Democrat Lateefah Simon, who sits on the Bay Area Rapid Transit board, will move on to that general election, it’s unclear who her opponent will be.
Jennifer Tran, a professor at Cal State East Bay, and Alameda Council member Tony Daysog are in second and third respectively as of Wednesday morning, with just 21% of the vote in. Both of them are Democrats, meaning the deep-blue seat could see a Democrat-versus-Democrat general election.
This is another deep-blue district being vacated by a Democratic incumbent (this time, Rep. Grace Napolitano) — and it sparked another crowded race to replace her.
With 66% of the vote in, former Democratic Rep. Gil Cisneros has a narrow lead over the field. But he’s followed closely by two Republicans, Daniel Martinez and Pedro Antonio Casas, who both sit within 2% of Cisneros as of Wednesday morning.
If one of those Republicans advance, Cisneros would become an even heavier favorite in this blue-tinted Southern California district.

2024-03-13T23:34:11.936Z,Hunter Biden gun case gets tentative trial date of June 3,NBC News,"The judge presiding over the federal gun case against Hunter Biden has tentatively scheduled a June trial for the criminal charges against the president's son.
During a scheduling conference in Delaware, U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika on Wednesday said she planned to start the trial the week of June 3.
In the hearing, prosecutors and Biden's attorneys said the trial would likely take a maximum of nine days — one or two days for jury selection, three to five days for the prosecution to present its case and one to two days for the defense.
""The actual trial days and length of trial will be determined at a later date,"" a posting on the court docket read after the hearing.
Biden was indicted in September on three counts tied to possession of a gun while using narcotics. Two of the counts accuse him of having completed a form falsely indicating he was not using illegal drugs when he bought a Colt Cobra revolver in October 2018, and the third alleges he possessed a firearm while using a narcotic.
Two of the counts carry maximum prison sentences of 10 years, while the third has a maximum of five years.
Biden has pleaded not guilty to the charges. His attorney, Abbe Lowell, has filed numerous motions to dismiss the case, all of which are still pending.
One potential complication for a June 3 start date is a scheduled status conference for the same day in the federal tax case against Biden in California. That case is scheduled to go to trial on June 20, and a prosecutor from special counsel David Weiss' office told Noreika on Wednesday that the California case could ""last several weeks,"" into mid or late July.
Noreika suggested both sides see if the date of the status conference could be moved since Weiss' office is also prosecuting that case.
The gun and tax cases were brought against Biden after a yearslong investigation by Weiss, the U.S. Attorney for Delaware who was appointed by former President Donald Trump.
Prosecutors and Biden's attorneys reached a plea agreement in July of last year that would have resolved both cases. Biden was set to plead guilty to two misdemeanor counts of failing to pay his taxes in return for prosecutors’ recommending probation, and a separate felony gun charge for illegally owning the handgun would have been dropped in two years if Biden honored the terms of what is known as a diversion agreement.
The agreement fell apart after Noreika raised questions about some of the details of the deal, including one provision that theoretically could have protected Biden from being charged with other tax-related crimes in the same time period.
Biden has pleaded not guilty in the California case, and his lawyer has moved to have those charges dismissed as well.

2024-03-09T23:56:18.257Z,Biden says he regrets referring to 'an illegal' and defends direct criticism of Supreme Court in State of the Union,NBC News,"President Joe Biden in a wide-ranging interview with MSNBC on Saturday defended his direct criticism of the Supreme Court for its 2022 decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health and said that he regrets having referred to an undocumented immigrant as an “illegal.”
“I think they made a wrong decision. I think they read the Constitution wrong. I think they made a mistake,” Biden told Jonathan Capehart, host of MSNBC’s “The Saturday Show” and “The Sunday Show,” during an exclusive interview on the campaign trail in Georgia.
He echoed remarks he made during his State of the Union address on Thursday when he addressed Supreme Court justices in the room, telling them, “With all due respect, justices ... you’re about to realize just how much you got right” about women’s electoral power.
“They used the phrase that women can vote making change, if they want to,” Biden told Capehart on Saturday, adding, “I found that somewhat insulting, the idea that they don’t think [women] can. Women are speaking now. They spoke out in 2022. They spoke out in 2024 — 2020. This is what’s going to happen. And I was just making clear, women speak up. This is going to change.”
Biden’s campaign also doubled down on his attacks on former President Donald Trump and the Supreme Court justices he appointed in a statement shared first with NBC News.
In the statement, a campaign spokesperson responded to news about the passage of a fetal personhood bill in the Iowa state House that could have negative implications for patients seeking in vitro fertilization treatments.
“IVF is at risk across the country and there’s one man to blame: Donald Trump. Donald Trump proudly brags he was able to ‘kill’ Roe and now women across the country are facing the consequences. Trump’s record speaks for itself: his Supreme Court pick Amy Coney Barrett refused to say if she would oppose criminalizing IVF,” senior campaign spokesperson Lauren Hitt said in the statement.
In Saturday’s interview, the president also said that he regrets using the word “illegal” to describe the undocumented immigrant who is charged with killing a 22-year-old nursing student in Georgia.
“During your response to [Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s] heckling of you, you used the word ‘illegal’ when talking about the man who allegedly killed Laken Riley,” Capehart said.
“An undocumented person. And I shouldn’t have used ‘illegal.’ It’s ‘undocumented,’” Biden said.
“So you regret using that word?” Capehart pressed him.
“Yes,” Biden replied.
The statement marks an apparent reversal from what Biden said Friday. While at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, the president was asked, “Do you regret using the word ‘illegal’ to describe immigrants last night, sir?”
“Well, I probably — I don’t re — technically not supposed to be here,” he responded.
During his State of the Union speech Thursday night, Biden used the term “an illegal” to describe Jose Antonio Ibarra, a Venezuelan who was previously arrested by federal authorities after having crossed the border into the U.S. Ibarra has been charged with killing 22-year-old nursing student Laken Riley. The president did not mention Riley’s case in his MSNBC interview.
Biden said Saturday that in his speech to Congress, he was attempting to highlight the differences between rhetoric offered by himself and former President Donald Trump about the border, pledging not to “treat any of these people with disrespect.”
“He talks about ‘vermin.’ The way he talks about these people ‘polluting the blood.’ I talked about what I’m not going to do. What I won’t do, I’m not going to treat any of these people with disrespect,” Biden said.
The president added, “I don’t share [Trump’s] view at all,” saying that immigrants “built the country, [are] the reason our economy is growing,” but still, “we have to control the border and more orderly flow.”
Ahead of a rally in Georgia on Saturday night, Trump met with Riley’s parents backstage.
When he took the stage later that evening, he mocked Biden’s apology for using the word “illegal,” telling the crowd, “They have a new name that’s even worse. They have a new name. You know what the new name is? Neighbor. They want to call them neighbor.”
Chris LaCivita, a senior adviser to Trump's campaign, told reporters before the rally that Biden’s apology was “tone deaf,” saying, “I mean he should be apologizing to the family, as opposed to apologizing for the word that he used.”
In his State of the Union, Biden did address Riley’s parents, saying he understands the pain that comes with the loss of a child, having lost two himself.
Asked on Saturday about whether he has a “red line” with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu amid Israel’s actions in the Israel-Hamas war, Biden suggested that some steps Netanyahu could take would be going too far.
“What is your red line with Prime Minister Netanyahu? Do you have a red line? For instance, would invasion of Rafah, which you have urged him not to do, would that be a red line?” Capehart asked.
“It is a red line,"" Biden said, adding, “but I’m never gonna leave Israel. The defense of Israel is still critical.”
Still, Biden was firm that Israel “cannot have 30,000 more Palestinians dead as a consequence of going after [Hamas],” likely citing figures showing that more than 30,000 people in Gaza have been killed, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry.

2024-03-09T01:26:08.483Z,Texas Gov. Greg Abbott embraces role as top Biden antagonist on border,NBC News,"AUSTIN, Texas — Gov. Greg Abbott was blunt when asked about President Joe Biden’s performance at the State of the Union address.
“I give it an ‘F’ for failure,” he said Friday in an interview at the governor’s mansion. “There’s a number-one issue in America and that’s securing the border. … It’s an issue on which [Biden] has failed, and he waited 40 minutes to even bring it up” in Thursday's speech, the Texas Republican said.
While recent polls show that the American electorate is increasingly concerned about illegal immigration, Abbott was beating the drum well before that. He’s been a thorn in the side of the Biden administration for years — and has now upped his national profile amid widespread speculation that he’s angling to be former President Donald Trump’s running mate, or perhaps his attorney general if he wins in November.
“My goal is singular — and that is to be the leader of the great state of Texas,” Abbott told NBC News.
Pressed on whether he planned to run for president in 2028, he demurred.
“I am planning on running for re-election as governor in Texas,” he said. “I take one step at a time.”
Abbott is next up for re-election in 2026.
At the moment, he’s defending House Republicans’ decision to kill a bipartisan border security bill — at Trump’s urging — that the president called out during Thursday night’s speech at the Capitol.
“If Joe Biden really believes in compromise,” Abbott said, “he would work with the House chamber.”
Before being elected governor in 2014, Abbott was the longest-serving attorney general in Texas history and was also a justice on the Texas Supreme Court. He was born in Wichita Falls and raised in Duncanville, Texas. Not long after law school, he was paralyzed by a falling tree while jogging.
Now he’s among the people considered most responsible for creating divisions among Democrats over the Biden administration’s immigration policies, in turn pushing them toward the right. His decision to bus migrants to major cities across the country slowly nudged Democratic mayors to break with Biden over the record migrant influx.
The White House has repeatedly called the busing program a “political stunt,” but it’s solidified Abbott’s dominance among the Republican base. Just this week, he and his attorney general, Ken Paxton, presided over a decisive victory in their home state: A slew of Republican candidates they had endorsed toppled many GOP members of the Texas House in a move seen as sheer political revenge. The Republican legislators who lost had crossed the governor on his legislative priority — school vouchers — and had tried to impeach Paxton.
The message was clear: Don’t mess with the Texas governor.
Abbott, 66, is also forging ahead with court battles over buoys in the Rio Grande, razor wire in Eagle Pass, and a new law that would fundamentally alter the relationship between local and federal government over immigration enforcement. The law, which was originally set to take effect Sunday, has been put on hold temporarily by the Supreme Court.
During the legal fight over the statute, a judge who sided with the American Civil Liberties Union and the Justice Department wrote that “surges in immigration do not constitute an ‘invasion.’”
Abbott brushed off that characterization on Friday.
“These are not migrants crossing the border,” he said. “These are people who are coming across a border in violation of federal law.”

2024-03-07T03:46:15.276Z,Alabama governor signs bill to protect IVF treatments into law,NBC News,"Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey signed a GOP-proposed bill to protect in vitro fertilization into law Wednesday night after weeks of backlash prompted by a controversial state Supreme Court ruling that embryos are considered children.
Ivey, a Republican, signed the measure just moments after lawmakers passed it and sent it to her desk.
""IVF is a complex issue, no doubt, and I anticipate there will be more work to come, but right now, I am confident that this legislation will provide the assurances our IVF clinics need and will lead them to resume services immediately,"" she said in a statement.
The swift action by the Republican-dominated Legislature capped a tumultuous weekslong sprint by lawmakers in the ruby red state sparked by the state Supreme Court's controversial ruling.
While the legislation enacted late Wednesday fails to answer the core question prompted by the court's decision — whether an embryo created by IVF should be treated as a child under Alabama law — the measure's Republican supporters were hopeful it would serve as a short-term solution that would allow clinics in the state that had halted their services to reopen.
The immediate responses from such clinics were mixed: Two said they would resume services quickly, but one of those expressed significant caution.
The enacted legislation doesn’t define or clarify whether under state law frozen embryos created via IVF have the same rights as children. Rather, the narrowly tailored bill is designed to protect doctors, clinics and other health care personnel who provide IVF treatment and services by offering such workers civil and criminal “immunity.”
The new law will “provide civil and criminal immunity for death or damage to an embryo to any individual or entity when providing or receiving services related to in vitro fertilization.”
It says that “no action, suit, or criminal prosecution for the damage to or death of an embryo shall be brought or maintained against any individual or entity when providing or receiving services related to in vitro fertilization.”
During debates in both chambers Tuesday, lawmakers removed the word “goods” from the phrase “goods or services” from the bill, meaning companies that provide items that are integral to the IVF process could still face civil suits — but not criminal prosecution — if their products are determined to damage or destroy embryos. The enacted bill also caps the monetary awards in such suits at the price patients paid for the affected IVF cycle.
Reproductive-rights advocates have said providers of such goods could, most prominently, include the liquid solution clinics use to help grow embryos.
Those groups criticized the legislation, saying it failed to fully protect IVF care against the broader issues the ruling raised.
Barbara Collura, the president of RESOLVE: The National Infertility Association, said in a statement that while her group was ""relieved that Alabama clinics can reopen their IVF programs,"" the ""legislation does not address the underlying issue of the status of embryos as part of the IVF process — threatening the long-term standard of care for IVF patients.""
""There is more work to be done,"" Collura said.
Karla Torres, senior counsel at the Center for Reproductive Rights, said the bill “falls far short of what Alabamans want and need to access fertility care in their state without fear.”
“Even on its face, this bill seeks to grant personhood to embryos, reinforcing the state Supreme Court’s extreme ruling recognizing embryos as children,” Torres said, adding that the legislation amounted to “backpedaling in the face of state and nationwide public outcry to allow politicians to save face.”
Nevertheless, at least two fertility clinics in the state signaled they were prepared to resume embryo transfers and other care as soon as this week.
“We believe that it provides the protections that we need to start care, or resume care,” Dr. Janet Bouknight, who practices at Alabama Fertility — one of the clinics that paused IVF after the ruling — said of the legislation.
But officials at UAB, which had also halted care, expressed caution.
""While UAB is moving to promptly resume IVF treatments, we will continue to assess developments and advocate for protections for IVF patients and providers,"" Hannah Echols, a UAB spokesperson, said in a statement.
The votes Wednesday followed multiple hearings over the past few weeks featuring hours of emotional and tense debate among state lawmakers, who, despite broad objections to the proposals, repeatedly voted overwhelmingly to continue advancing them.
During discussions last week about the bills, pro-reproductive-rights Democrats joined anti-abortion-rights Republicans in criticizing the bill for failing to explicitly clarify whether an embryo created by IVF should be treated as a child under Alabama law.
Democrats had sought language clarifying that embryos weren’t children under the law, while some Republicans had argued for “personhood” language establishing that they were. Democrats in the GOP-controlled Legislature had proposed their own bills that sought to explicitly clarify that an embryo “outside of the uterus” isn’t “considered an unborn child,” though those bills didn’t advance.
The enacted bill’s Republican supporters repeatedly said that the legislation is imperfect and that it is intended as a quick fix to allow the several IVF clinics in the state that closed after the ruling to reopen without fear of criminal prosecution or civil suits for their employees.
In her statement after she signed it, Ivey called the bill a ""short-term measure"" that could allow ""couples in Alabama hoping and praying to be parents"" to ""grow their families through IVF.""
Her signature — at least for now — caps weeks of national blowback prompted by the state court’s decision that embryos created through in vitro fertilization are considered children.
Specifically, the Alabama Supreme Court found that people can be held legally responsible for destroying embryos under a state wrongful death law declaring that an unjustified or negligent act leading to a person’s death is a civil offense. As a result, providers of IVF services and embryo transport could have faced repercussions if embryos were discarded — a common part of the IVF process, because some embryos can have genetic abnormalities or may no longer be needed.
The ruling last month immediately prompted several IVF clinics to halt their services and gave rise to broader concerns that anti-reproductive-rights conservatives elsewhere could go after the medical procedure.
The decision triggered a massive outcry against Republicans in Alabama and across the U.S. who have opposed reproductive rights — including calls from former President Donald Trump to address the issue “quickly” — sending lawmakers in the state scrambling to come up with a fix.

2024-03-13T00:14:04.921Z,Biden talks up Social Security in courting Teamsters endorsement,NBC News,"WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden on Tuesday made Social Security a key part of his pitch to the Teamsters leadership in a closed-door meeting as the powerful labor union weighs its 2024 endorsement.
Speaking with the leadership board, Biden discussed labor issues and Social Security a day after former President Donald Trump said in a CNBC interview that “there is a lot you can do in terms of entitlements, in terms of cutting.”
As in his State of the Union address last week, Biden did not refer to Trump by name but instead called him ""the former president,"" according to Teamsters vice president at-large John Palmer, who attended Tuesday's meeting.
Biden ""got really passionate about Social Security"" and cited Trump's recent comments, Palmer said. He added that Biden used what he called a ""Joe-ism"" when he was talking about Trump, saying, ""C'mon, man.""
The union has yet to endorse a presidential candidate. It usually waits until after the party conventions, spokesperson Kara Deniz said.
Asked whether the union will follow its traditional schedule this year, Deniz said, “We have a process we are following, and the roundtable is a part of that.”
The Republican National Convention is in July, followed by the Democratic convention in August.
Some Teamsters want the union to endorse Biden “sooner rather than later,” Palmer said. He counts himself in that group.
“Every day matters, especially about getting in front of the membership and explaining to them why. I mean, the differences couldn’t be any more stark,” Palmer said of Biden and Trump.
In a post on X about Tuesday's meeting, the union said it “is conducting national polling of the membership and will begin work with its 360 local union affiliates to convene townhalls to hear directly from as many members as possible in all states in the lead up to the 2024 race.”
Teamsters General President Sean O’Brien said in the post: “We appreciate President Biden taking time out of his busy schedule to meet with Teamsters members and leadership. The President shared that he is committed to continuing to support workers and standing with labor if elected to a second term.”
Trump met with the Teamsters leadership in January. After the meeting, he told reporters that he believed he had a “good shot” at securing the union’s endorsement.
“Usually a Republican wouldn’t get that endorsement,” he said.
The union endorsed Biden in 2020. Four years earlier, it endorsed Democrat Hillary Clinton.
In a statement Tuesday, the Biden campaign pointed to other union endorsements Biden has received, adding, “We hope to earn the support of the Teamsters as well.”
The campaign highlighted his ""historic, pro-union record,"" including a visit to a striking autoworkers' picket line in Michigan in September.

2024-03-11T20:24:17.973Z,Trump endorses former Rep. Mike Rogers in Michigan's GOP Senate primary,NBC News,"Former President Donald Trump waded into another battleground Senate race Monday, endorsing former Rep. Mike Rogers, a onetime critic, in Michigan’s crowded Republican primary.
“He will tirelessly fight to Secure the Border, Stop Inflation, Grow the Economy, Strengthen our Military / Veteran Support, and Protect and Defend our always under siege Second Amendment,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Mike Rogers will be a Great and Powerful Senator for Michigan, and has my Complete and Total Endorsement.”
Rogers has emerged as a front-runner in the August primary for the seat held by Debbie Stabenow, a Democrat who is not seeking re-election this year. The National Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee has endorsed Rogers, and his chances improved after former Detroit Police Chief James Craig dropped out of the GOP race last month.
“Thank you, Mr. President!” Rogers posted on X. “Excited to get to work with you to Get America and Michigan Back on Track!”
A Trump-Rogers alliance would have seemed unlikely a year ago. Rogers, who had been out of politics since 2015, had been exploring a long-shot Republican presidential bid.
“Trump’s time has passed, but we still want to speak to people who are frustrated with where America is going,” Rogers told The Washington Post in November 2022.
And in a January 2023 interview with NBC News, Rogers questioned whether Trumpism was a successful formula for Michigan Republicans after massive midterm losses.
“Remember ‘The Gong Show?’” Rogers asked, referring to a late ’70s televised talent show on which losers were voted off by the sound of a gong. “I think we got a double gong.”
Rogers has praised Trump since he launched his Senate campaign, and he endorsed Trump in January. His competition in the Senate primary features two former congressmen who voted to impeach Trump — Justin Amash and Peter Meijer. Also running are Nikki Snyder, a state Board of Education member, and businessman Sandy Pensler, who lost to Trump-endorsed John James in Michigan's 2018 GOP Senate primary. James lost to Stabenow that fall, but he won a House seat in 2022.
“The chaotic Senate primary is getting even nastier as Trump pours gasoline on the fire,” Michigan Democratic Party Chair Lavora Barnes said in a statement responding to Trump's endorsement.
Stabenow's retirement and Michigan's swing status in recent presidential elections are expected to make for a competitive Senate race this fall. Rep. Elissa Slotkin has emerged as the front-runner on the Democratic side.
Trump has endorsed candidates in several other top Senate races this year, including Ohio’s, in which his preferred candidate, Bernie Moreno, is trying to fend off two rivals in the March 19 GOP primary. In Montana, Trump's endorsement of Tim Sheehy chased Rep. Matt Rosendale out of what had been expected to be a nasty Republican primary.

2024-03-08T11:00:41.000Z,Sen. Tester asks Congress to fund installation of border fentanyl scanners that now sit idle,NBC News,"As millions of dollars in fentanyl scanning equipment intended for the southern border sits unused, Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., is blaming Republicans and asking congressional appropriators to approve the money needed to install the machines in this year’s homeland security funding bill.
Tester says Republicans who killed the bipartisan border security bill this year should now support funding to install the machines. “Many of these scanners are currently sitting in warehouses unused,” Tester said Friday in a letter to the House and Senate appropriations committees, “because Senator Mitch McConnell and politicians in Washington blocked bipartisan border security legislation that would have appropriated funds to install them.”
Customs and Border Protection says the majority of the fentanyl it seizes at the border comes into the U.S. through personal vehicles at legal ports of entry.
But in an interview this week, acting CBP Commissioner Troy Miller told NBC News that large scanners used to detect hidden packages in cars crossing the border that could contain fentanyl are sitting idle because the agency lacks the funding from Congress to install them.
Tester says funding for installation is essential: “These scanners allow Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents to scan vehicles and cargo in order to detect fentanyl and other dangerous contraband that criminals are trying to smuggle into our country.”
Congressional Republicans have raised their own concerns about fentanyl scanners at the border.
In October, Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, and House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Mark Green, R-Tenn., requested in a letter that the Government Accountability Office conduct a “top to bottom” review of how CBP has used the $1.9 billion it has received to enhance border screening since 2018. That review is underway by the GAO, according to a spokesperson for the watchdog.
In the letter, the Republican lawmakers complained that while CBP has received almost $2 billion to boost scanning, the percentage of personal vehicles scanned is only 2%.
Miller said he still needs $200 million or $300 million to put the equipment that CBP purchased into the ground.
He said that CBP is scanning less than 5% of personal vehicles and that by the end of 2025 he wants it to be able to scan 40% of personal vehicles.
Miller said it would not be practical to try to scan 100% of the vehicles crossing the border, because of the volume of traffic. With 1 million people crossing the U.S.-Mexico border every day, he said, scanning every vehicle would “shut down legitimate trade and travel.”

2024-03-12T01:52:56.016Z,Group submits signatures in effort to recall top Wisconsin Republican targeted by Trump,NBC News,"A group that's aiming to recall Robin Vos, the speaker of Wisconsin’s state Assembly and a top target of former President Donald Trump, said it has submitted the number of signatures needed to move forward with an effort to oust the Republican leader from office.
Recall Vos said it had gathered more than the nearly 7,000 required signatures from voters in Vos' district. The filing deadline for the recall effort is Monday.
""I carry with me the voice of more than 10,000 Racine County residents,"" the group's recall petitioner, Matt Snorek, said at a news conference outside the Wisconsin Election Commission shortly before it delivered the signatures. ""Together we are challenging the status quo, driven by the numerous ways in which Speaker Robin Vos has failed us.""
Riley Vetterkind, a spokesperson for the Wisconsin Elections Commission, confirmed that the group had submitted signatures but said that they had not yet been reviewed.
Members of the bipartisan commission are scheduled to meet Tuesday to discuss the recall petition. The six-member panel will decide whether the petition is sufficient to call for a recall election. An officeholder targeted by a recall effort can also challenge the petition within 10 days of its submission.
Vos did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday night.
Snorek characterized the petition as being driven in part by comments he said Vos made about Trump's candidacy this year.
“I don’t think Robin Vos should be going and working against a conservative candidate, when they’re the leading candidate, because in my opinion that runs us the risk of getting Joe Biden elected here in 2024,” Snorek said.
Snorek also pointed to Vos’ not advancing an effort to impeach the state’s chief election official, Meagan Wolfe, whom Wisconsin Republicans have criticized over how she conducted the 2020 election. Wolfe has also been outspoken in condemning election fraud falsehoods promoted by Trump and his allies in Wisconsin.
Vos, the longest-serving speaker in Wisconsin history, has been a target of Trump and his supporters after Trump lost the battleground state in the 2020 general election by about 20,000 votes. He refused Trump's urging to dismiss the 2020 results during what he said was a call from Trump in July 2022 demanding that he retroactively apply a Wisconsin Supreme Court ruling that restricted the use of absentee ballot drop boxes in future elections.
Vos had launched a probe into the election results under pressure from Trump, which found no evidence of widespread fraud.
Trump also campaigned against Vos' re-election bid in 2022, endorsing challenger Adam Steen. Vos ultimately prevailed in that primary by 3 percentage points — the slimmest margin in his political career. He was re-elected as speaker in 2022.

While Trump and attorneys in the case will know the identities of the jurors, their names will be shielded from the press and the public, Judge Juan Merchan said in his order, citing ""a likelihood of bribery, jury tampering, or of physical injury or harassment of juror(s).""
The judge said his order applies only to jurors' identities and addresses, and had been requested by prosecutors from the Manhattan district attorney's office and consented to by Trump's attorneys.
""To be clear, the parties have not requested, and this Court has not agreed, to close the Courtroom during jury selection or at any other time during the proceedings. Access to the courtroom by the public and the press will not be tempered in any way as a result of these protective measures,"" Merchan said.
He also granted a request by Trump's attorneys to ""minimize potential prejudice"" to their client by not notifying the jurors of the protective measures and giving ""neutral explanations"" if they ask about them. He asked both sides to jointly submit ""proposed neutral explanations"" by March 15, and said if they can't agree on language, to file separate suggestions by March 18.
Jury selection is scheduled to begin March 25.
Trump is charged with falsifying business records related to hush money payments that his then-attorney Michael Cohen paid to adult film actor Stormy Daniels in the closing days of the 2016 presidential campaign. Trump has pleaded not guilty in the case, which will be the first of four pending criminal cases against him to go to trial.
The Manhattan DA's office had also asked Merchan to warn Trump ""that any harassing or disruptive conduct that threatens the safety or integrity of the jury may result in forfeiture of Defendant's access to juror names."" The judge said he will rule on that issue when he decides on the DA's request for a partial gag order barring Trump from bashing witnesses and court staff members in order to ""protect the integrity of this criminal proceeding.""
The trial will not be the first Trump case with an anonymous jury.
The New York federal judge who presided over writer E. Jean Carroll's two defamation trials against Trump used anonymous juries, noting the former president's often inflammatory rhetoric about the justice system and the threats from his supporters that sometimes follow.
""For purposes of this order, it matters not whether Mr. Trump incited violence in either a legal or a factual sense. The point is whether jurors will perceive themselves to be at risk,"" U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan, who oversaw the defamation trials, wrote in a ruling last year. He also cited ""the strong likelihood of unwanted media attention to the jurors, influence attempts, and/or harassment or worse by supporters of Mr. Trump [and/or by Mr. Trump himself].""

The move comes as the organization focuses on voting and election-related concerns following the Trump campaign's effective takeover of its leadership.
Republican lawyer Charlie Spies will serve as the RNC's chief counsel, the source said. Spies recently worked for Michigan Republican Rep. John James and previously served in Mitt Romney's 2008 presidential campaign. He notably rejected the prevalent election denialism in the party while speaking on a panel at the Conservative Political Action Conference in 2021, drawing shouts from the crowd.
Christina Bobb, who has served on the Trump campaign’s legal team and is a prominent figure in pushing the GOP's unfounded claims of a stolen 2020 election, will serve as senior counsel for election integrity, the source said. Bobb confirmed she joined the RNC in a post on X.
She emerged as a key player in Trump’s legal battles over his alleged mishandling of classified documents. In 2022, she certified to the FBI that all of the relevant material sought by investigators had been turned over — information that Evan Corcoran, another Trump lawyer, told her, according to the indictment against the former president.
Bobb has also appeared as an on-air personality for Trump-backing right-wing media outlets One America News Network and Right Side Broadcasting Network. She attended Trump's party at his Mar-a-Lago residence on the night of Super Tuesday.
Spies and Bobb did not immediately respond to NBC News' request for comment.
The RNC’s hiring of Spies and Bobb follows mass layoffs at the organization and the installation there of two new Trump-approved leaders: Michael Whatley, former chair of the North Carolina Republican Party, as the group's chairman and Lara Trump, the former president’s daughter-in-law, as its co-chair, NBC News previously reported.
Chris LaCivita, a Trump co-campaign manager, was recently appointed as chief operating officer of the RNC. Sean Cairncross, who led RNC operations from 2015 to 2016, was tapped by LaCivita to serve as his deputy.
Former RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel announced her resignation last month after Trump endorsed Whatley to lead the organization.

The lawsuit, filed by the consumer advocacy group Travelers United in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, alleges that Noem ""advertised a product or service without disclosing that she has a financial relationship with that company"" after she posted a video to social media Tuesday regarding dental services she received.
In the video, Noem describes consulting with and subsequently getting her teeth adjusted by a cosmetic dental company known as Smile Texas. The video appeared on Facebook, X, Truth Social, and Instagram.
Doctors at Smile Texas helped adjust Noem's teeth from a biking accident years before that knocked out all of her front teeth, she says in the roughly five-minute video.
""The team here was remarkable and finally gave me a smile that I can be proud of and confident in, and that really is a gift that I think is going to be incredibly special to have,"" Noem says. ""I chose the team here at Smile Texas because they’re the best.""
The lawsuit accuses Noem of ""deceptive advertising practices,"" which the group says violated consumer protection laws in Washington, D.C. It also cites Federal Trade Commission guidelines on including language to distinguish social media posts as advertisements.
Noem ""seems to have taken up work as a social media influencer,"" the group wrote in the filing, arguing that the video post is intended to promote medical tourism and advertise services to D.C. residents.
“Companies, like Smile Texas, pay influencers, like Kristi Noem, to promote their product or service to her followers,” the filing, submitted by Lauren Wolfe, an attorney for Travelers United, said.
“There is no disclosure that this is an advertisement or that she received any free or discounted medical procedures in exchange for this social media advertisement,” the document added.
The group is asking the court to order Noem to pay punitive damages in an amount determined at trial, award statutory damages to Travelers United, and block Noem from advertising on social media without disclosure.
Smile Texas and a spokesperson for Noem did not immediately respond to NBC News' request for comment on Wednesday night.
Noem is among former President Donald Trump's potential picks for a running mate on the Republican presidential ticket.
Her team previously confirmed to NBC News that she met with the former president at Mar-a-Lago on Feb. 26, but it declined to provide details about the meeting.

""My first acts as your next President will be to Close the Border, DRILL, BABY, DRILL, and Free the January 6 Hostages being wrongfully imprisoned!"" Trump wrote on his Truth Social account.
It appeared to be the first time that he has definitively referred to releasing the Jan. 6 defendants as a Day One priority.
A spokesperson for President Joe Biden's campaign, Sarafina Chitika, said in a statement in response to Trump's comments that the former president ""has shown he’ll do whatever it takes to hold on to power — including excusing and encouraging political violence.""
""The American people haven’t forgotten the violent attack at our Capitol on January 6 — they know Trump is too dangerous to be let anywhere near the Oval Office again, and they’ll turn out to protect our democracy and keep Trump out of the White House this November,” Chitika said.
Trump has repeatedly called on Biden to “release” the Jan. 6 defendants and has suggested he would be likely to pardon a large number of them if he is elected in November. He also regularly characterizes the defendants as ""hostages,"" a comparison the White House has called “grotesque.”
Nearly 500 people have been sentenced to incarceration over the riot on Jan. 6, 2021, and prosecutors have secured more than 950 convictions, according to the U.S. attorney's office for Washington, D.C. More than 1,350 people have been charged in connection with the attack.
Last year, Trump promised that he would pardon a ""large portion"" of Jan. 6 defendants, adding that he would do it ""very early on."" A president has the power to pardon and commute federal sentences upon taking office.
Trump posted the vow the same day that a Republican-led House committee investigating the Jan. 6 committee released a report alleging that four Trump White House employees did not corroborate a key element of former aide Cassidy Hutchinson's testimony before the Jan. 6 committee in 2022.
Trump was indicted in August over allegations related to his actions on Jan. 6. The charges included conspiring to defraud the country and obstructing an official proceeding. He has pleaded not guilty.

2024-03-06T21:00:40.000Z,"A federal agency has told rural counties and small towns how to safeguard their elections, but not all can afford the fixes",NBC News,"The federal agency charged with safeguarding the nation’s elections has provided recommendations to rural counties and small towns on how to protect their computers and the sites where they count votes, but some of those communities say they don’t have the money to make the fixes ahead of November’s election.
Jen Easterly, director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), which oversees federal election security efforts, said that after the 2022 midterms her agency heard from rural areas that they needed extra help with election security. She said that CISA, formed in 2018, is committed to providing it.
“States to this point in time, they have pretty good resources and capabilities to deal with the full range of threats,” Easterly said. “But at the local level, townships, municipalities, counties, that’s where we have a challenge for resources. So that’s where we’ve been focused.”
But NBC News spoke to 17 election officials from smaller jurisdictions in eight states who said they worry communities like theirs aren’t getting the money they need from their counties, states or Washington, D.C., to make badly needed security upgrades.
The officials were not worried about vote outcomes being manipulated, but about physical threats to election offices and election workers. Several clerks told NBC News that their jobs have drastically changed in recent years because of rising threats posed by people who believe disinformation online that Donald Trump won the 2020 election and have shown up where votes are being counted, often intimidating election workers.
In Jackson County, Oregon, County Clerk Chris Walker recalls the threat her staff received in 2020 right after the presidential election, which Trump and many of his supporters said was stolen. In large letters in a parking lot across the street, someone painted “Vote don’t work, next time bullets.”
“I would not be truthful if I didn’t tell you I have lost sleep,” Walker said. “The job … has completely changed.”
A security adviser from CISA had come to visit Jackson County 11 months prior to the incident and suggested making upgrades to the CCTV system and outdoor lighting, but Walker could not afford to add cameras in the parking lot across the street where the threat was painted.
“We got recommendations to better secure our facility. But it’s a work in progress. You’re never able to do everything all at once,” Walker said.
Across the state, in Harney County, Oregon, County Clerk Dag Robinson has similar fears about threats to his election workers. In November, his small staff will count votes in the county courthouse, which has a parking lot that was used as a staging area in 2016 by a militia that was occupying the nearby Malheur National Wildlife Refuge.
“It was 41 days of hell for anyone who worked in this building,” Robinson said.
During a recall election following the occupation, Robinson brought in armed guards from a neighboring county to protect staff counting the ballots. But he won’t be able to borrow those guards during a general election when they are used by their own county.
CISA also sent him recommendations, such as protecting his power sources, arming the doors and setting up a barrier between observers and vote counters, but he hasn’t been able to afford those.
“They’ve pointed out issues that we need to deal with and have given us some avenues for some help for that, but they don’t offer really any funding for that,” Robinson said.
Across the country, in Shutesbury, Massachusetts, town clerk Grace Bannasch is worried about the weather or anything that could disturb her computer and power system, since the town lacks an IT department.
She recalls the night before last year’s local elections where she had to grease up her arm to reach behind an antique desk to find a backup power source. She was thankful she did because she did lose power briefly during the election the next day. Having a generator on site, or an IT department to call, would help alleviate her concerns, but the town is unable to afford it.
Bannasch said she recognizes that the federal government is intentionally limited in its involvement in elections, to instill confidence that there has been no interference, but she thinks it could play a larger role.
“I think the technology aspect is a place where the federal government can absolutely step up and support without having the ability to interfere"" in elections, Bannasch said.
CISA's Easterly said her agency points local jurisdictions to places where they can seek grant funding at the state and federal level.
Brianna Lennon, who manages elections as the clerk in Boone County, Missouri, said the process of seeking money can be prohibitively expensive. Some towns and counties don’t have the staff to submit grant applications and make sure they remain in compliance.
Easterly encouraged states to invest more in voting security for their towns and counties. Said Easterly, “States also need to focus on this on a matter of top priority, particularly as we go into this presidential election year.”

2024-03-10T12:00:40.000Z,Biden team brings in $10 million in the 24 hours after the State of the Union,NBC News,"President Joe Biden’s re-election machine brought in $10 million in the 24 hours following his State of the Union address on Thursday — a financial jolt as the campaign looks to build general election momentum off the speech.
The sum, which was shared first with NBC News, is a record for Biden’s re-election effort, the campaign said. And it’s notable even in the context of big political fundraising numbers. Biden’s campaign and affiliated committees powering the Democratic National Committee and other party groups raised $42 million in the entire month of January, for example.
The money flowed in via approximately 116,000 donations from 113,000 contributors, a senior Biden campaign adviser said. And the total builds on Biden’s early financial advantage over former President Donald Trump.
Biden’s campaign proper had $56 million in the bank at the end of January, the most recent period covered by public campaign finance filings, while the DNC had $24 million. Trump and the Republican National Committee, meanwhile, had $30 million and $9 million on hand, respectively. Both operations also had additional money stashed away in other fundraising accounts.
The Biden camp is leaning into its early cash edge, on Saturday launching the first ad of a $30 million, six-week effort to blanket swing states with the campaign’s message. The first ad features Biden speaking straight to camera, acknowledging his age but saying he “understand[s] how to get things done.” Biden then lists a slew of accomplishments since he was sworn in and makes a series of contrasts with Trump in the ad.
Biden’s campaign said its $10 million post-State of the Union total came amid other highs in the past week. The president’s operation raised $1.5 million online Wednesday as Trump became the presumptive GOP nominee.
The campaign said its grassroots fundraising has ticked up to record levels for the re-election bid in each of the past four months, culminating in new hourly online fundraising records three hours in a row during the State of the Union.
“Ten million dollars in 24 hours. To quote the boss, that’s a BFD,” Biden campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said in a statement, referencing Biden’s off-color hot-mic moment celebrating the passage of Obamacare when he was vice president.
“We thank our grassroots supporters who are motivated more than ever to reelect President Biden and Vice President Harris. The President’s State of the Union address reminded so many of our supporters who is fighting for them, and the stakes of this election for our freedoms, our rights, and our democracy,” Chavez Rodriguez continued, adding: “We send our condolences to the other guy and his flailing, poor campaign. Turns out attacking women’s rights, cutting taxes for the rich, and attacking American democracy isn’t exactly a winning message.”

2024-03-09T00:25:02.264Z,'Disappointing': Biden's reference to 'an illegal' upsets some Democratic allies,NBC News,"WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden received widespread praise from Democrats for his fiery State of the Union speech Thursday night, when he leaned in on issues that will likely be central to the 2024 election. But one of the moments that struck a discordant note with some of his allies was on the issue of immigration, when Biden referred to an undocumented immigrant as “an illegal.”
The unscripted moment came when Biden brought up Laken Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student who was murdered in Georgia. An undocumented immigrant has been charged with her killing. Biden called her “an innocent young woman who was killed by an illegal.”
That term has long been rejected and seen as dehumanizing by the Democratic Party and immigration advocates, so it was noticeable when the president used it in a most high-profile speech.
“There was a lot of good in President Biden’s speech tonight, but his rhetoric about immigrants was incendiary and wrong,” Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, posted to X in the moments after the speech.
Castro’s guest to the annual speech was Priscilla Martinez, the widow of Aaron Martinez, the Texas rancher who was killed by a neighbor in what Castro described as an anti-Latino “hate crime.”
Those charges were ultimately never brought against the man charged with fatally shooting the 35-year-old, but by inviting Martinez, Castro said he aimed to highlight a rise in violence against Hispanic Americans and immigrants in the aftermath of Donald Trump’s presidency.
“The speech was very strong overall, but the President needs to be careful about not adding fuel to the right-wing fire that fearmongers about immigrants and scapegoats them for our national challenges,” Castro added in a statement to NBC News.
Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., who, like Castro, is a member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, said “the president’s ad-lib last night was deeply disappointing.”
He called the comment “the type of dangerous rhetoric that [Biden] has denounced in the past and I expect that he will do so again. We can not tout a strong economy and nation while at the same time vilifying immigrants who contribute so much to the strength of both.”
But on Friday, Biden appeared to have no regrets, telling reporters, “Well, you know, technically he’s not supposed to be here.”
An aide to a Democratic lawmaker said they were “stunned” by Biden’s use of the phrase, adding that other staffers on Capitol Hill felt similarly as they watched the speech.
“It was just shocking rhetoric to hear from a Democratic president who campaigned against demonizing immigrants,” they added.
Biden’s comments came after he reversed course in recent months on policy toward the southern border, which has seen record migrant crossings under his administration. Lagging behind in approval ratings and with political pressure to address the crisis growing, Biden declared in January that he would be willing to accept steep restrictions to the asylum system and other measures once inconceivable for many Democrats.
He even went so far as to say he would “shut down the border” if Congress passed legislation that would have given his administration the enforcement mechanism to do so. A bipartisan border bill blocked by Republicans was a topic Biden highlighted during his Thursday-night speech.
“That bipartisan bill would hire 1,500 more security agents and officers, 100 more immigration judges to help tackle the backload of 2 million cases, 4,300 more asylum officers and new policy so they can resolve cases in six months instead of six years,” Biden said in the House chamber, directing his ire at Republicans. “What are you against?”
Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, president and CEO of Global Refuge, an immigration advocacy organization, said, “Obviously, language matters, but so does the intent behind it. While it was an unfortunate word choice in a heated moment of heckling in a wider context of this speech, President Biden was quite clear in drawing a stark contrast with the dehumanizing language and policies of his predecessor.”
“I wouldn’t have used the word illegal,” Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif., said on MSNBC on Thursday night. “But I think the president quickly shifted, he began quickly talking about immigrants right after that, and I think that as an immigrant myself, I was heartened to talk about the importance of immigrants and to push back on Donald Trump and his rhetoric essentially calling us that we are somehow poisoning the blood of this country.”
Biden campaign manager Julie Chávez Rodríguez told reporters Thursday morning that the president’s policies and actions are what should speak the loudest.
“Our community knows Joe, they know who is fighting for our community, they know who’s fighting for us,” she said.
But not all on the left were upset by Biden’s tone during the speech.
Biden brought up Riley holding a button with her name that Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., had handed him before the speech. Republicans have invoked her death in their push for stricter border policies — and as a way to blame Biden for not doing enough.
Biden “flipped the script” on Republicans by talking about Riley, one border-state Democrat speaking on condition of anonymity said, applauding the way the president “neutralized this issue that Republicans gave him the opening to because they blocked the bill.”
Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., who is running for independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema’s seat, said he thought the speech was “a good reset” for Democrats as they head into a critical election in November where the balance of power in Washington is at stake.
A recent poll showed Latinos have mixed views on immigration. In the Pew Research Center survey, three-quarters of Latinos agreed that the border is in crisis or a problem. However, two-thirds said speeding up asylum decisions with more judges and staff would help and 58% said creating more legal migration pathways was needed. Just a third supported increasing deportations of people in the country illegally, and a quarter backed substantially expanding the wall.
Despite the criticism, Voto Latino, a progressive group focused on mobilizing young Latinos to vote, planned to formally endorse the Biden re-election effort at a rally in Las Vegas that Vice President Kamala Harris would attend Saturday.
Maria Teresa Kumar, the group’s president and CEO, said that despite Biden’s “forced error” on Thursday, Voto Latino was endorsing him as it realizes “young people are struggling with how to participate” in 2024, and it wants to show them that “their vote is going to determine the course of our democracy.”
She said those who are hyperfocused on Biden’s language are missing the point, applauding his call for a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers who arrived in America when they were children.
“I’ve had the privilege of knowing the president for a long time and his words are not what is in his heart,” she said, referring to his “an illegal” remark.
A Mexican immigrant on Friday told NBC News that they were not offended of Biden’s use of the term “illegal.”
“What’s important is to focus on what they’re going to do with migration, not the words that they use,” said Raúl Morales, who added that he is in the process of obtaining his green card and will not be voting in the 2024 election. “Because they can talk using nice words, but if they don’t solve something with migration, it’s not use[ful] to me if they use sophisticated or kind terms.”

2024-03-11T16:35:30.647Z,"Housing Secretary Marcia Fudge is stepping down, the second Biden Cabinet member to leave the administration",NBC News,"WASHINGTON — Marcia Fudge, who has served as the secretary of housing and urban development since March 2021, is leaving the Biden administration, the White House said Monday.
""When I took office, we inherited a broken housing system, with fair housing and civil rights protections badly dismantled under the prior administration,"" President Joe Biden said in a statement. ""On Day One, Marcia got to work rebuilding the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and over the past three years she has been a strong voice for expanding efforts to build generational wealth through homeownership and lowering costs and promoting fairness for America’s renters.""
Biden continued: ""From her time as a mayor, to her years as a fierce advocate in the U.S. House of Representatives, Marcia’s vision, passion, and focus on increasing economic opportunity have been assets to our country. I’m grateful for all of her contributions toward a housing system that works for all Americans, and I wish her well in her next chapter.""
The White House said that after Fudge departs, Deputy Secretary Adrianne Todman will serve as acting secretary.
In a statement, Fudge said she's resigning effective March 22, but didn't say whether she has other plans for her career.
""For the last three years, I have fully embraced HUD's mission to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all,"" she said, adding that as she transitions to life as a public citizen, ""I will continue to do the work that I have been called to do.""
Fudge is only the second Cabinet secretary to leave the administration during Biden's first term as president. The first was Marty Walsh, who left in March 2023 after serving as labor secretary for two years.
White House chief of staff Jeff Zients had said in an interview published last week by Politico that all current Cabinet members and senior White House staff would remain in their roles for the remainder of Biden's first term.
A White House official said they knew about Fudge's plans in advance and ""Jeff was answering a question about whether we have the team in place this year at the Cabinet and at the White House.""
In Biden's 2025 budget request released Monday, the Department of Housing and Urban Development requested from Congress a nearly $500 million increase in funding to its programs. It calls for an expansion in access to affordable rent through the Housing Choice Voucher Program and increasing the supply of affordable housing to reduce housing costs.
Before working in the Biden administration, Fudge represented an Ohio congressional district in the House from 2008 to 2021, serving at one point as chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus.

2024-03-13T19:46:46.445Z,Sen. Katie Britt says House Speaker Mike Johnson told her to ignore 'horror stories' before her State of the Union response,NBC News,"Facing backlash over her State of the Union response last week, Alabama GOP Sen. Katie Britt on Wednesday revealed that Speaker Mike Johnson reassured her ahead of the speech to ignore any ""horror stories"" and that the moment wouldn't blow up her career.
""The funny thing is, [Johnson's] like, 'No, don't worry about, you know, people are going to tell you horror stories about all of these things that happened and people's career being blown up over it.' And he's like, 'It'll be fine,'"" Britt told Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and his co-host Ben Ferguson on an episode of the ""Verdict with Ted Cruz"" podcast.
The two later joked about the backlash to Florida GOP Sen. Marco Rubio's flub during his 2013 State of the Union response when he sipped from a bottle of water minutes before the end of his speech. And they mentioned then-Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal's State of the Union response in 2009, which was labeled by Fox News as a ""poor performance"" and ""amateurish.""
This year, Britt is under fire for her speech, but the Alabama senator struck a mostly jovial tone on the podcast, describing a phone call with Johnson shortly after Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., offered her the chance to give the official GOP response to President Joe Biden's State of the Union address last week.
Cruz told Britt about the money Rubio's campaign raised selling water bottles after his blunder.
""Well, we're going to have to figure out what I can sell,"" Britt replied.
Britt has faced criticism for how she described an encounter with a victim of human trafficking during a 2023 visit to the U.S.-Mexico border.
In her speech, Britt said she spoke with a woman who ""had been sex-trafficked by the cartels starting at age 12. She told me not just that she was raped every day, but how many times a day she was raped.""
“We wouldn’t be OK with this happening in a Third World country. This is the United States of America, and it is past time, in my opinion, that we start acting like it,” she added. “President Biden’s border crisis is a disgrace.”
Shortly after her speech, a viral TikTok by journalist Jonathan Katz alleged that the victim Britt was referring to had been trafficked in the early 2000s, during President George W. Bush's administration, not the Biden administration.
Britt did not address these allegations in Wednesday's podcast with Cruz, but she blamed the ""liberal media"" multiple times for turning against her in the wake of her address.
""I mean, my crime was putting too much passion, too much heart and soul behind the issues that I genuinely care about, and they slaughtered me across the airways,"" Britt told Cruz.
She later added that the crisis at the border ""is not only a national security crisis, but a humanitarian crisis that no reporter is telling. ... They’re not telling the story of human trafficking and what’s happening under [Biden].”
Asked directly on Fox News over the weekend about the story she told in her speech, Britt deflected, saying that she did not mean to give the impression that the story had happened during the Biden administration.
""I very clearly said I spoke to a woman who told me about when she was trafficked when she was 12, so I didn’t say a teenager. I didn’t say a young woman, a grown woman, a woman when she was trafficked when she was 12,"" Britt told ""Fox News Sunday.""
Also on Sunday, Karla Jacinto Romero, the victim that Britt was referring to, told CNN that Britt had inaccurately portrayed her story when she alleged that Jacinto Romero had been trafficked by drug cartels, clarifying that she was trafficked by a pimp in Mexico who would entrap vulnerable young women.
""I work as a spokesperson for many victims who have no voice, and I really would like them to be empathetic: all the governors, all the senators, to be empathetic with the issue of human trafficking because there are millions of girls and boys who disappear all the time. People who are really trafficked and abused, as she mentioned,"" Jacinto Romero told CNN.
Elsewhere in Wednesday's podcast, Britt joked about the backlash she's faced in the wake of her State of the Union response, referring to movie star Scarlett Johansson playing her on NBC's ""Saturday Night Live"" over the weekend.
""I mean, how awesome is that?"" Britt asked as Cruz lamented that a ""gorgeous movie star"" has never played him on ""SNL.""
""Scarlett Johansson, here you have Black Widow. They bring in someone from Avengers to play me in the cold open. I'm here for it,"" Britt added.

2024-03-07T19:25:15.003Z,Larry Hogan declines to say whether he'd support a federal law to codify Roe v. Wade,NBC News,"Former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan on Thursday declined to say whether he would vote to protect in vitro fertilization or codify Roe v. Wade into federal law if Maryland voters send him to the Senate in November.
Speaking at an Axios event in Washington, the Republican candidate told the moderator that he ""didn't even know [IVF] was an issue"" until the Alabama Supreme Court's decision last month to declare embryos people in the state.
Hogan also said that he didn't know if IVF was ""ever going to come up"" to a vote in the Senate and that he didn't want to ""speculate on what the legislation might look like.""
Pressed further on the issue, Hogan said he didn’t have a good answer on what to do about embryos that are created during the IVF process but don’t get used. But, he added, “I’m not an expert. ... I don’t think politicians ought to be telling [women and their doctors] what to do.”
Hogan added, ""This is a wonderful thing and should never be limited.""
In recent weeks, Hogan has made clear that he opposes a federal abortion ban, but on Thursday he declined to say whether he would support legislation aimed at codifying Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court case that granted the national right to abortion until the court overturned it in 2022.
""We’re going to have to take a look at that as we move forward,"" Hogan said about codifying Roe, adding that he'd have to consider ""whether it’s needed or not.""
""It wasn’t a yes or no [answer],"" he said when pressed about whether he'd vote to codify Roe.
The answers illustrate the uncertain state and federal legislative landscape on reproductive health issues since the Supreme Court's 2022 Dobbs decision.
Hogan is the only major Republican running in Maryland's Senate race, hoping to fill the seat of retiring Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin.
While Maryland trends Democratic, Hogan served as governor in the state for two terms — from 2015 to 2023 — and was widely reported to be considering a presidential run in 2024.
He chose instead to enter the Senate race in February, just hours before Maryland's filing deadline.
On the Democratic side, Rep. David Trone and Prince George's County Executive Angela Alsobrooks are running in the primary.
Democrats are expected to make abortion a focal point in this race and other battleground Senate races this cycle.
Maryland currently has no gestational limit on the procedure, and voters in November will vote on a ballot measure that would enshrine ""the ability to make and effectuate decisions to prevent, continue, or end one's own pregnancy"" in the state constitution.
""If Marylanders want to vote for that, they should have the right to do that,"" Hogan said Thursday, adding, ""They're already completely protected in Maryland.""

2024-03-13T23:06:06.924Z,Judge in Georgia election interference case dismisses three counts against Trump,NBC News,"ATLANTA — The judge presiding over the election interference case in Georgia has dismissed some of the criminal counts against former President Donald Trump.
In a ruling Wednesday, Judge Scott McAfee found that six of the counts in the indictment against Trump and some of his co-defendants, including his former chief of staff Mark Meadows and lawyer Rudy Giuliani, lacked sufficient detail. The judge left open the possibility that prosecutors could re-file the counts.
""As written, these six counts contain all the essential elements of the crimes but fail to allege sufficient detail regarding the nature of their commission, i.e., the underlying felony solicited. They do not give the Defendants enough information to prepare their defenses intelligently,"" McAfee wrote.
The counts the judge tossed involved accusations that Trump and his co-defendants had requested state officials violate their oaths of office. The judge found that the language used in the indictment was too ""generic"" and did not specify which part of which oath of which constitution — the state or federal — they'd been accused of requesting the officials to violate.
""The Court’s concern is less that the State has failed to allege sufficient conduct of the Defendants – in fact it has alleged an abundance. However, the lack of detail concerning an essential legal element is,"" the judge wrote, ""fatal.""
One of the dismissed counts involved Trump's call to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, urging him to ""find"" enough votes for him to be declared the victor in the state, which he'd lost to Joe Biden. Another involves a letter Trump sent to Raffensperger urging him to ""decertify"" the 2020 election results.
Trump was indicted on three of the six counts that were dismissed. He still faces 10 other counts in the case.
In a footnote, the judge said the DA's office could ""seek a reindictment supplementing these six counts"" with more information. He also allowed the ""overt acts"" the counts were tied to to remain as part of the larger racketeering indictment.
Trump attorney Steve Sadow praised the judge's decision in a statement. ""The ruling is a correct application of the law, as the prosecution failed to make specific allegations of any alleged wrongdoing on those counts. The entire prosecution of President Trump is political, constitutes election interference, and should be dismissed,” he said.
A spokesperson for Giuliani, Ted Goodman, praised the ruling and said, “The sooner this whole show trial is dismissed, the sooner we can restore the rule of law in this country.""
The DA’s office and Raffensperger’s office declined to comment.
Trump and the co-defendants affected by the ruling, including Giuliani, Meadows and lawyer John Eastman, have pleaded not guilty.
The decision comes ahead of another highly anticipated ruling McAfee is expected to issue this week — whether Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis should be disqualified from the case. The judge has said he plans to issue that ruling in the coming days.

2024-03-14T14:47:37.191Z,Democratic group meddles in Ohio's GOP Senate race to boost the Trump-backed candidate,NBC News,"CLEVELAND — A Democratic group is airing a TV ad in Ohio’s hostile Republican Senate race emphasizing Bernie Moreno’s conservative positions and endorsement from Donald Trump — a move Moreno’s rivals see as an effort to influence the results of Tuesday’s primary.
“Moreno would lead the charge to enact Trump’s MAGA agenda to repeal Obamacare and institute a national ban on abortion,” the narrator says in the spot from Duty and Country PAC, which is affiliated with Senate Majority PAC, a Democratic super PAC with ties to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York.
“Donald Trump needs Bernie Moreno,” the narrator concludes. “Bernie Moreno does not.”
AdImpact, a firm that tracks political ad spending across the country, first captured the 30-second ad Thursday morning on a local CBS station in Toledo. Duty and Country PAC has $1.9 million in ad spending reserved from Thursday through next week’s primary.
Ohio’s Senate race is expected to be one of the most competitive and expensive in the country this fall, with Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown seeking re-election in a state Trump won twice by 8 points.
The GOP primary is ending on a particularly tense and nasty note. Moreno, a businessman, is facing an aggressive challenge from state Sen. Matt Dolan, who has spent millions of his own dollars. Trump is scheduled to hold a rally for Moreno on Saturday night near Dayton, while Dolan has scored late endorsements from Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine and former Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio. Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose is also running for the Republican nomination.
“Seen those ads supporting Bernie Moreno? Know who is paying for them? It’s Chuck Schumer,” Dolan posted Thursday on X. “Schumer just got CAUGHT meddling in our primary because he wants the weakest opponent for Sherrod Brown. Enough is enough.”
LaRose took a similar tack.
“Chuck Schumer is funding pro-Moreno ads because he knows Bernie’s background makes him the weakest candidate to face Sherrod Brown,” LaRose wrote in an X post late Wednesday. “The more Ohioans learn about Moreno, the less they trust him.”
The content of the Duty and Country ad, first reported on by Politico, frames Moreno’s credentials as a negative at the beginning and the end but otherwise scans as a highlight reel that could appeal to right-leaning voters in the three-way primary. The meddling strategy has become increasingly common in campaigns, especially by Democrats seeking to draw a more favorable general election matchup.
Then-Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., who was vulnerable in her 2012 re-election campaign, famously ran ads to elevate Todd Akin, a weaker candidate, in the GOP primary. Akin won the nomination, but his campaign later imploded after inflammatory comments about “legitimate rape” and abortion rights.
More recently, Democrat Josh Shapiro aired an ad spotlighting the conservative credentials of Republican Doug Mastriano in Pennsylvania’s 2022 GOP primary for governor. Mastriano won the nomination, and Shapiro beat him easily in the general election.
“National Democrats are putting millions of dollars behind Bernie Moreno in the waning days of this primary because he is damaged, unelectable and incapable of defeating Sherrod Brown,” Chris Maloney, a Dolan strategist, told NBC News. “Ohio voters will see through Chuck Schumer’s deception and reject this attempt by Sherrod Brown’s allies to meddle in the primary.”
""When Ohio voters head to their polling place they deserve to know the truth about Bernie Moreno — and the truth is that Moreno is a MAGA extremist who embraced Donald Trump just like he embraced his policies to ban abortion nationwide and repeal the ACA,"" Senate Majority PAC spokesperson Hannah Menchhoff said in a statement.
Reagan McCarthy, a spokesperson for Moreno’s campaign, suggested that Democrats should be careful what they wish for, noting how many thought Trump would be the easiest Republican for Hillary Clinton to beat in the 2016 presidential election. Clinton lost.
“The same thing,” McCarthy said, “is going to happen to Sherrod Brown this year.”

2024-03-07T22:09:53.827Z,Why Biden is making ‘freedom’ a central campaign focus: From the Politics Desk,NBC News,"Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team’s latest reporting and analysis from the campaign trail, the White House and Capitol Hill.
In today's edition, Mike Memoli and Ghael Fobes, who cover the ins and outs of Joe Biden's White House and campaign, report on how ""freedom"" has become a key pillar of the president's re-election effort. And stay tuned for a special post-State of the Union edition of From the Politics Desk tonight.
When President Joe Biden launched his re-election campaign last April, the first word he uttered was “Freedom.”
It’s a theme that will not only be a key pillar of his State of the Union address tonight, but of his re-election bid going forward as he turns his attention to a rematch with Donald Trump.
The Biden team’s focus on freedom and threats to democracy as a defining electoral issue has often invited criticism from allies, at a time when Americans’ perceptions of the economy, and of the 81-year-old president himself, are also expected to dominate the months ahead.
Do you have a news tip? Let us know
Advisers understand the importance of Biden’s delivery in answering questions about his age, and agree on the need to help better connect the administration’s economic agenda and accomplishments to the improvements in voters’ everyday lives.
But none of that will matter, aides counter, if America’s democracy falters, a reality the president will starkly warn is possible, and one his advisers say voters have already responded to.
Biden plans to invoke Franklin Roosevelt’s 1941 address to Congress, which became known as the “Four Freedoms” speech, in his own speech tonight. FDR defined what he called the “four essential human freedoms” — of speech and expression, of worship, freedom from want, and freedom from fear.
Biden, who has a framed painting of Roosevelt displayed prominently in the Oval Office, has offered his own version of the four freedoms for the 21st century.
“We’ll be voting on many issues: on the freedom to vote and have your vote counted, on the freedom of choice, the freedom to have a fair shot, the freedom from fear,” Biden said during a speech near Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, earlier this year.
It’s become a consistent theme for the president, one that his advisers felt was made all too clear in the events of Jan. 6 — 80 years from the day of the Roosevelt speech Biden will reference.

Keep an eye out for a special edition of the From the Politics Desk newsletter tonight, where we will be recapping and analyzing Biden’s State of the Union address, which starts at 9 p.m. ET.
As NBC News’ Alex Seitz-Wald, Gabe Gutierrez and Monica Alba report, the president will begin to lay out a second-term agenda, highlighting the post-Covid economic recovery and outlining the administration’s plans to revamp the tax code, expand housing supply and reduce the federal budget deficit. He will also announce plans to add a port that will be used by the U.S. and its partners to get aid into Gaza.
And he will aim to create a stark contrast with Trump on issues ranging from health care costs to the Russia-Ukraine war, while seeking to ease growing unhappiness inside his own party about his handling of the Israel-Hamas war, NBC News’ Peter Nicholas and Mike Memoli note.
Freshman Sen. Katie Britt of Alabama is set to deliver the official Republican response to Biden’s address.

2024-03-13T20:15:59.616Z,Sen. Katie Britt has told her misleading anecdote about sex trafficking multiple times,NBC News,"WASHINGTON — Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., has come under fire in recent days over allegations that she misrepresented the story of a sex trafficking victim in the Republican response to the State of the Union last week.
An NBC News review of her remarks over the last year shows it’s an anecdote she’s used often to criticize the Biden administration’s border policies, though the victim she references was trafficked through Mexico roughly two decades ago.
During her response to the State of the Union, the freshman senator spoke about her visit to the U.S.-Mexico border in 2023 and told a graphic story involving rape and sex trafficking to criticize President Joe Biden’s border policies.
“When I first took office, I did something different. I traveled to the Del Rio sector of Texas, where I spoke to a woman who shared her story with me. She had been sex trafficked by the cartel at the age of 12. She told me not that she was raped every day, but how many times a day she was raped,” Britt said during her address on Thursday.
“We wouldn’t be ok with this happening in a Third World country. This is the United States of America, and it is past time, in my opinion, that we start acting like it,” she added.
It was later reported by an independent journalist that the woman in Britt’s speech was Karla Jacinto Romero and that she was trafficked in Mexico, not the United States, when Republican George W. Bush was president. Jacinto Romero testified before Congress in 2015, telling members she was trafficked by a pimp, not by Mexican drug cartels, as Britt suggested.
NBC News has found that prior to the State of the Union response, the junior Alabama senator had referenced Jacinto Romero’s story at least five separate times over the last year in press conferences and cable news interviews to criticize the Biden Administration for its border policies, implying that Jacinto Romero’s trafficking and rape occurred under the Biden Administration.
“As a mom, to sit across from a young woman who told me it wasn’t that she was raped every day, it was how many times a day she was raped at the hands of the drug cartels,” Britt said during a press conference on the Biden administration lifting the Title 42 immigration policy on May 11, 2023.
“I have talked to these young women, and it wasn’t that they were raped every day, it was how many times a day they were raped,” Britt said at a press conference on human trafficking at the border on July 20, 2023.
During another press conference on September 20, 2023, regarding Biden’s “Border Catastrophe,” Britt again referenced Jacinto Romero’s account of rape.
“I have talked to women who have not just told me that they were raped, but they’ve told me how many times a day they were raped at the hands of the drug cartels,” she said.
Although Britt has never named Jacinto Romero in the multiple times she referred to her story, a spokesperson for her office confirmed to The Washington Post that the woman cited in her State of the Union response address was Jacinto Romero.
Asked by NBC News about her repeated re-tellings of the story in connection to Biden’s immigration policies, Britt issued a statement targeting the media.
“It’s past time for the media to stop covering for Joe Biden’s re-election campaign and start talking about the immense, very real human suffering that’s occurring right now under his policies,” she said.
“The cartels are making record-shattering profits from human trafficking. Historic numbers of migrants are dying at the border. And between brutal murders and fentanyl poisonings, far too many Americans are being killed. That’s the story the media doesn’t want to tell,” she added.
NBC News has reached out to Jacinto Romero for comment but did not immediately receive a response. Speaking to CNN, Jacinto Romero said she felt that Britt told an inaccurate story of her experience.
During an interview on Fox News Sunday, Britt did not acknowledge that she misrepresented Jacinto Romero’s experiences, and declined to say why she chose a case that did not happen under Biden’s presidency to highlight what she referred to as the administration’s failed border policies.
“I very, very clearly, said, I spoke to a woman who told me about when she was trafficked when she was 12. So I didn’t say a teenager. ... She was trafficked when she was 12,” she said.
Britt has been outspoken about her opposition to the Biden Administration’s border policies, arguing that the president’s policies have caused a security and humanitarian crisis at the southern border.

2024-03-09T00:35:47.045Z,Trump posts $91 million bond and files notice of appeal in E. Jean Carroll case,NBC News,"Attorneys for former President Donald Trump filed official notice Friday they're appealing the $83 million defamation verdict awarded to writer E. Jean Carroll — and that they've posted the $91 million bond needed to keep her from collecting while the appeal plays out.
The lawyers asked the judge in a court filing for an order approving the $91,630,000 bond and staying execution of Carroll's judgment.
The terms of the bond — and how much money or collateral Trump put down — are unclear. The source of the bond is the Federal Insurance Company, a corporation authorized to transact business in New York. It is based in Chesapeake, Virginia and New Jersey and the company appears to be a subsidiary of Chubb Insurance Company. The document is signed by the former president.
The judge ordered Carroll’s attorneys to respond to Trump's request by Monday morning. He said he could hold a hearing that afternoon if they have any opposition to it.
The filing came as a surprise because Trump's lawyers have repeatedly asked the judge for more time to post the bond and to reduce the amount. The bond was needed to prevent Carroll from moving to collect on the judgment during the pendency of the appeal, which could take months or even years. It's greater than the amount of the actual verdict to account for New York's 9% annual interest rate.
The automatic stay of the judgment was set to expire Monday, at which point Carroll's attorneys could have moved to start collecting the money she was awarded for Trump's having defamed her when he was president and then after she received a separate $5 million judgment against him last year. He's appealing that verdict also, and had $5.5 million in cash put up as security for that judgment.
Carroll called the development “stupendous” in a Substack post. She wrote that while her attorney Roberta Kaplan “is strong enough to yank a golden toilet out of the floor at Trump Tower and toss it through the window, this bond saves Robbie the trouble of showing up with US Marshals on Monday to do so.”
Court documents show Trump signed the new bond agreement on Tuesday, and the attorney for FIC signed it on Wednesday — the same day that Trump's lawyers filed a letter asking the judge to stay the judgment for three days after he rules on their previous request for a stay, which he has yet to do.
U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan rejected that request in an order Thursday and chided Trump for trying to rush his ruling. “Mr. Trump’s current situation is a result of his own dilatory actions. He has had since January 26 to organize his finances with the knowledge that he might need to bond this judgment, yet he waited until 25 days after the jury verdict” and shortly before the expiration of the automatic stay to seek relief, the judge wrote.
Trump is facing a similar — and larger — issue in New York state court, where he was hit last month with a $464 million civil fraud judgment.
Trump's attorneys have asked an appeals court to reduce the size of the bond he has to post in that case, a request that was rejected by the judge who heard the case. “To account for post-judgment interest and appeal cost, a surety will often set the bond amount at 120% of the judgment or more,” Trump attorney Clifford Robert wrote in a filing to the appeals court. That would total well over $500 million.
A single judge from the state Appellate Division last month denied Trump's request to reduce the size of the bond to $100 million, but set an expedited briefing schedule for Trump’s stay motion. That leaves open the possibility that a full panel of judges could act before Trump has to file the bond.
The current deadline for him to file is March 25 — the same day jury selection is set to begin in Trump's criminal trial in New York state court. He's charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records relating to hush money payments that were paid to a porn star in the closing days of the 2016 election. Trump has pleaded not guilty.
CORRECTION (March 8, 2024, 7:35 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article mischaracterized a transaction stemming from the appeal of last year’s $5 million judgment against Trump. He had $5.5 million in cash put up as security; he did not post a bond.

2024-03-12T01:20:47.954Z,Trump to rally for Bernie Moreno days before high-stakes Ohio Senate primary,NBC News,"CLEVELAND — Former President Donald Trump will battle Ohio’s old-guard Republican establishment in the closing days of the state’s competitive GOP Senate primary.
Trump announced late Monday that he will headline a Saturday rally near Dayton aimed at pushing his preferred candidate, Bernie Moreno, across the finish line.
Buckeye Values PAC, a pro-Moreno group, will host the event, set for three days before the primary featuring Moreno, state Sen. Matt Dolan and Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose. There have been few independent polls gauging the state of the race, but the campaigns are treating it as a dead heat, with millions of dollars flooding the Buckeye State’s airwaves and nasty attacks among the candidates escalating.
A source close to Trump told NBC News earlier this month that a rally for Moreno was “highly unlikely.” It was unclear Monday what had changed the political calculus. But the announcement comes after several high-profile endorsements for Dolan. Hours earlier Monday, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine and his wife, Fran, declared their support for Dolan. Former Sen. Rob Portman, whose wife had been raising money for Dolan, offered his endorsement last week.
“Matt Dolan has a vision for the future. He listens. He fights. And, he knows how to get results for Ohio,” DeWine said in an open statement to Ohio voters. “We have worked to bring business to Ohio and to create an environment in this state that will continue to grow jobs and keep Ohio moving forward. Matt has been a real partner to make Ohio a national leader in economic growth, job creation, and innovation. He is fighting and winning to bring jobs to Ohio and secure a prosperous economic future for our children and grandchildren.”
DeWine has not tightly tied his political identity to Trump. The former president endorsed his 2022 reelection bid — but only after a primary in which DeWine faced a challenge from the right. Dolan, too, has avoided getting too close to Trump. He presents himself as a champion of Trump policies but has acknowledged that the two are not in sync, personality-wise.
“His personality? It’s not me. His political style? It’s not me,” Dolan said at a debate last week with LaRose and Moreno. “But his policies that make your life better, that make America stronger, that will make Ohio stronger? That is me.”
Andy Surabian, a GOP strategist close to Trump's team who is advising Moreno, cast Tuesday’s primary as a battle between Trump’s MAGA coalition and RINOs, or Republicans in name only. In a post on X, he stacked the DeWine and Portman endorsements for Dolan against Moreno’s backing from Trump, Ohio Sen. JD Vance and another prominent Ohio conservative, Rep. Jim Jordan.
“The Ohio Senate race,” Surabian wrote, “is officially Team America First vs Team RINO.”

2024-03-08T23:56:50.899Z,House Republicans consider a loan program for some Ukraine aid,NBC News,"WASHINGTON — House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and the chairmen of key House committees dealing with national security are working to develop their own Ukraine aid package, an alternative that they hope can pass Congress without alienating conservatives who oppose further funding for the war-torn country.
The plans are in their preliminary stages and far from fully formed, three sources told NBC News, but Republicans who support Ukraine want to be prepared to tackle the legislation as soon as Congress clears another government shutdown deadline on March 22. Waiting any longer could push passage of critical aid for Ukraine into April, given a planned two-week congressional recess at the end of March, two sources said.
Among the proposals being floated is treating some of the nonmilitary aid as a type of loan, said House Foreign Affairs Chairman Mike McCaul, R-Texas, who is involved in the discussions, and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. Economic aid to support the general function of Ukraine’s government and its long-term rebuilding efforts would be subject to a loan under this plan. Russian assets seized by the U.S. government through sanctions could also be used as collateral for loans to the Ukrainians, McCaul said, adding that the plan could also have a generous repayment system to help Ukraine.
Offering up loans as part of the package is designed to help ease the concerns of House conservatives who have criticized billions in U.S. aid for Ukraine and said they will not support sending further U.S. taxpayer dollars without a long-term plan to win the war.
House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., expressed only modest interest in the new proposal Friday, saying, “We’ve been having a lot of conversations about how to resolve the differences” on Ukraine.
McCaul said the proposal would make Russia at least partially responsible for paying for Ukraine to rebuild.
“We’re looking at two factors. One is my REPO Act, which will allow us to attach assets related to the Russian sovereign assets that have been sanctioned to help pay for Russia’s war crimes. That’s a very popular idea in the House,” McCaul said. “And secondly, the loan program. … At the end of the day, the Russian sovereign assets would pay for that or they would just default.”
The Democratic-led Senate Foreign Relations Committee overwhelmingly passed its version of the REPO Act at the end of January but leadership has not put the bill on the Senate floor because it could destroy a sense of urgency to get Ukraine the aid it needs to turn the tide of the war, a senior Democratic aide told NBC News. The House has not taken up the bill yet either.
Graham endorsed the loan idea in an interview last week, crediting former President Donald Trump with coming up with it. Trump posted on his Truth Social site on Feb. 10 that Congress should not provide aid money to any country “unless it is done as a loan.”
Graham, who once espoused unconditional support for Ukraine, helped to kill a Ukraine aid and border package in the Senate earlier this year that he helped to negotiate, saying that Trump opposed it and preferred a loan structure.
“I think President Trump when he mentioned a couple of weeks ago that let’s make this stuff a loan, resonates with the taxpayer,” Graham said last week. “And I think it will make it unlock the House. … You may have to add a little more humanitarian aid to get Democrats, but turn it into a loan and maybe we get this thing done.”
Asked about the loan idea last month, national security adviser Jake Sullivan said that there “can be a place for loans in foreign assistance,” but suggested that Ukraine isn’t one of them. “When you’re dealing with a country that is fighting for its life, like Ukraine … talking about loans as opposed to providing the necessary infusion of cash is only going to make the economic problems of that country worse,” he said, adding that a stable Ukraine “is in the fundamental national security interest of the United States.”
A U.S. official familiar with White House’s position told NBC News Friday that some “aid is better than no aid, but this is not an ideal way of doing it. ... Asking a country to take on tens of millions of dollars of debt that they can’t afford to pay off is a recipe for a significant burden, will hurt Ukraine long term and could lead to economic crises down the road.”
The foreign aid and border package that passed the Senate last month is “still the best path forward,” the official said, noting that Johnson was briefed by the CIA director last week “and is well aware of how dire the situation is in Ukraine right now and how bleak the country’s options are to continue defending itself.”
Johnson has not yet made a final determination on how the House will proceed after rejecting the Senate-passed aid package last month.
McCaul is insistent that work on a new Ukraine aid package begin soon, suggesting the House would write its own bill and send that back to the Senate. “We’re not interested in a pingpong match. We want to have a bill that’s solid that we can pass here, and I believe we can, and send it over to the Senate and go to the White House,” he said. “This is urgent in Ukraine. We can’t waste any more time.”
One consideration for Johnson, two sources said, is that if the House punts the foreign aid bill to April, Republicans will have rounded the corner on several key primaries, which could free up additional GOP support for funding to Ukraine, said two officials with knowledge of discussions.
Meanwhile, as NBC News reported last month, the Pentagon is weighing giving Ukraine urgent weapons without waiting for Congress to approve funds. The lion’s share of assistance for Ukraine comes in the form of weapons pulled from the U.S. supply; the nonmilitary aid that could be subject to a loan is just a small slice of U.S. aid to the country.
And other supporters of Ukraine in the House have prepped long-shot bids to try to force the aid money through.
House Democrats have prepared a discharge petition, a procedural mechanism to force a vote on a piece of legislation essentially over the speaker’s head, to try to pass the Senate immigration and foreign aid bill. But they would need 218 signatures to force that vote, and that means getting several Republicans to join their efforts.
Separately, Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., and Jared Golden, D-Maine, authored their own foreign aid package that offers less funding for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan than the Senate bill. It also includes some provisions to reduce the number of migrant crossings at the southern border. Fitzpatrick said he has personally spoken to both Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., about a way to bring the bill to the floor for a vote and he’s preparing his own discharge petition as a backstop to apply pressure to get a vote.
Those efforts appear to be making no headway, however. On Friday, when Scalise was asked if there would be any consideration of Fitzpatrick’s bill, he responded with a firm, “No.” And Jeffries repeated his insistence that the Senate foreign aid bill is “the only way forward” in the House because it would get bipartisan support from Democrats and Republicans — a necessary ingredient given the dozens of House Republicans opposed to continuing to fund Ukraine’s war.

2024-03-12T22:05:49.457Z,'Democrats for Border Security' task force seeks to redefine the party on immigration,NBC News,"WASHINGTON — A newly formed group of House Democrats is seeking to shift the party's positioning on immigration to the center and address a major vulnerability for President Joe Biden that could shape his prospects for re-election this fall.
The “Democrats for Border Security” task force is co-chaired by Reps. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, who represents a border district, and Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y., who flipped a Republican-held swing district after he campaigned on his support for tougher border laws.
One thing they have in common: They're fed up with the party's leftward turn on immigration over the last decade and want a course change to emphasize enforcement. Cuellar's calls for tougher immigration laws date back years. Then Suozzi successfully deployed it in the suburbs of New York. They both say Democrats must do the same to win competitive House districts and defeat former President Donald Trump this November.
“I think it’s a pretty good pathway for Democrats. Don’t cede the narrative to Republicans when it comes to border security,"" Cuellar said in an interview. “It doesn’t matter if we’re Hispanics. We want to see order. We want to see security.""
A late-January NBC News poll found that Trump has a 35-point advantage over Biden among voters asked who they believe would do a better job at ""securing the border and controlling immigration."" Trump and Republicans are putting a heavy emphasis on a border crackdown as their pitch to voters in the election.
In his special election last month, Suozzi sought to flip the script by going on offense with border security, embracing a bipartisan bill to impose tougher asylum laws and depicting his Trump-aligned opponent as seeking to exploit the issue for political gain. He also called for more legal pathways for aspiring Americans. It worked.
Suozzi said he has told the White House that Biden can replicate his strategy successfully all over the country. And he believes Biden has begun to do it.
“I think Democrats are already changing,” Suozzi told NBC News. “Democrats have always been concerned about border security, but now they’re being more vocal about it and proactive about it. And I think the president is doing that.”
The new caucus has 26 members, including a host of Democrats in tough districts, including Reps. Matt Cartwright, D-Pa.; Angie Craig, D-Minn.; Jared Golden, D-Maine; Susie Lee, D-Nev.; Steven Horsford, D-Nev.; Mike Levin, D-Calif.; Jared Moskowitz, D-Fla.; and Mary Peltola, D-Alaska. It also includes Reps. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., and Colin Allred, D-Texas, who are running for the Senate in border states where immigration looms large for their electorates.
“Look, some of the loudest voices on the border crisis have made clear they have no interest in solving it,” Gallego said. “The Arizona border leaders and law enforcement I’ve met with are tired of it. We need to cut through the noise and get a border security bill done.”
Some progressives are uneasy with the shift. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., the Congressional Progressive Caucus chair, said Democrats “can’t be Republican Light on harsh enforcement policies” after they ran against Trump’s border policies in 2020. She wants Democrats to “start making the connection between chaos at the border and chaos in the legal immigration system.”
She added: “I’ve asked the White House to not use some of those harsh statements and instead focus on Republican hypocrisy.”
The leftward shift traces to former President Barack Obama's second term after he dominated among Hispanic voters in 2012. A popular narrative formed that a more liberal immigration stance was key to winning more Hispanic voters. Democrats, egged on by activists who criticized Obama as too tough on deportations, de-emphasized punishment for lawbreakers and focused their rhetoric on creating pathways to citizenship.
But over time that narrative fell apart, as the asylum system became overwhelmed with more migrants than the government can process. In 2016, Trump gained ground with Hispanic voters relative to Republicans in 2012, while campaigning on mass deportations for people in the U.S. illegally, winning 28%. That rose to 38% for Trump in 2020, when his harsh immigration policies included family separation. Diverse Texas districts along the Mexico border, once Democratic strongholds, have shifted toward Republicans.
Cuellar, whose break with liberals over immigration dates to the Obama era, said the Democratic Party was led astray, as Hispanic voters also want to punish lawbreakers.
“That’s a myth,” Cuellar said. “They want border security. Still be respectful of the immigrants, but they want border security.”
He said public perception has moved away from Democrats on the issue — not because the party doesn't support resources for enforcement but because “Democrats won’t talk about border security” as much in recent years.
“I’m glad that the White House and other Democrats are looking at this as a very important issue to people — not only people like my constituents on the border but in other places. So yes, I see a shift from the White House, which I support,” he said. “I see a shift from other Democrats, more to the middle, to the center, where most Americans are at.”

2024-03-13T18:00:13.724Z,ICE agents will start wearing body cameras in five U.S. cities,NBC News,"Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers will start wearing body cameras to record their interactions with migrants and the public in five U.S. cities, acting ICE Director P.J. Lechleitner announced on Wednesday.
After a six-month pilot program was deemed successful, ICE will start requiring officers working with Homeland Security Investigations as well as those responsible for arresting and deporting migrants to wear cameras on their uniforms in Baltimore, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., Buffalo and Detroit.
“This is promoting transparency and maintaining the public’s trust,” Lechleitner said.
The program makes good on a 2022 executive order signed by President Joe Biden to mandate the adoption of body-worn camera policies for all federal law enforcement agencies.
But without more money from Congress, Lechleitner said, ICE will not be able to expand the use of body-worn cameras beyond those five cities.
Lechleitner said ICE is facing a budget shortfall unless Congress appropriates more money. The appropriations bill through which the agency is currently funded is set to expire on March 22.
Without more funding, ICE is facing a $500 million budget gap and will have to start cutting “key operations,” including detention and deportation of migrants, by May, sources told NBC News.
ICE is overseen by the Department of Homeland Security. Four law enforcement agencies overseen by the Justice Department — the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the U.S. Marshals — have said they are rolling out the use of body cameras by law enforcement in specific cities, as NBC News previously reported. The Justice Department said it is “committed to full implementation,” but the agencies have not yet adopted the use of body cameras on a widespread basis.

2024-03-08T22:04:38.966Z,Trump supporter charged with firing a gun during the Jan. 6 Capitol attack,NBC News,"WASHINGTON — A Donald Trump enthusiast who appeared to fire two gunshots at the Capitol on Jan. 6 was arrested by federal authorities on Friday.
NBC News identified John Emanuel Banuelos two years ago as the man in photos and video footage who appeared to be flashing a gun in his waistband as he fought officers on Jan. 6, 2021.
Last month, Jan. 6 rioter Derrick Evans, who is now running in a Republican House primary in West Virginia, published previously unseen video that appeared to show that Banuelos actually fired his weapon twice outside the Capitol that day. Online ""sedition hunters"" who have aided the FBI in hundreds of arrests of Capitol rioters — and who first sent Banuelos' name to the FBI in February 2021 — quickly surfaced additional footage that confirmed that Banuelos was the man who appeared to have fired the weapon.
Banuelos, 39, now lives in Summit, Illinois, and he made his first appearance in federal court in Illinois on Friday after his arrest.
Banuelos, as NBC News reported in conjunction with NBC affiliate KSL, was arrested about six months after the Capitol attack, when he fatally stabbed a 19-year-old in a park in Utah on July 4, 2021. Banuelos was not charged in that attack because he claimed self-defense, but he told investigators that he was at the Capitol on Jan. 6 and had displayed his weapon.
“Man, should I just tell the FBI to come get me or what?"" he said in the interview with Salt Lake City police, police records show.
While numerous rioters were armed with guns on Jan. 6, none were known to have actually fired their weapons; Banuelos is the first to be charged with doing so. The shots he allegedly fired outside the Capitol came at 2:34 p.m., which is about 10 minutes before Ashli Babbitt was fatally shot as she breached a window leading into the Speaker's Lobby. That means it was a member of the pro-Trump mob — not law enforcement — that fired the first gunshot of the day.
Charging documents say that Banuelos ""can be seen waving the crowd towards him before pulling what appears to be a firearm from his waistband.""
The FBI affidavit said that the footage published by Evans, as well as CCTV footage highlighted by NBC News last month, showed Banuelos ""raising the gun over his head, and, at approximately 2:34 p.m., firing two shots into the air.""
The FBI special agent who signed the affidavit said that based on their training and experience with firearms, Banuelos' ""actions and the object he is holding is consistent with an operable firearm."" The FBI affidavit also notes the bureau received a tip from someone who personally knew Banuelos in February 2021. The person, who had known Banuelos for numerous years, told the bureau that Banuelos said he was in a Vice video about the Capitol attack.
Last year, according to the FBI, Banuelos posted a video on X that appeared to show him racking a semi-automatic weapon, in response to a post that included an FBI poster featuring his image. Banuelos, in an interview with the FBI, ""denied intending to threaten anyone and claimed that many of his posts were done by artificial intelligence"" and ""stated that any weapons seen in his posts on X were fake and/or done by artificial intelligence.""
This week, an Instagram account under Banuelos' name responded to a request for comment from NBC News that was sent last month after the footage of the gunshots emerged. ""The only thing I would like to say is that there's a war going on between the truths of God and the lies of this world the flesh and the devil,"" the account under Banuelos' name wrote. ""And my personal mantra that goes like this God first, think twice moved once, to be aware is to be alive!""
More than 1,300 people have been charged in connection with the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, and more than a dozen people were arrested this week alone.

2024-03-14T00:56:45.340Z,A key county in the middle of the 2024 race tries to pick sides,NBC News,"RENO, Nevada — The road to the White House in 2024 runs through a handful of places like Washoe County and “The Biggest Little City in the World.”
The home of Reno is the most purple county in a critical purple state, the crucial battleground of Nevada. And with Republicans putting their presidential primary behind them, the onus is now on appealing to voters in the middle in places like this. Washoe is both a key focus and potential problem spot for both parties heading into the 2024 election.
In 2016, Hillary Clinton carried the county over Donald Trump by just over 1 percentage point. Four years later, Joe Biden extended that local lead to 4.5 points, but the result in this year’s contest is far from assured.
The latest numbers from Nevada’s Secretary of State show Republicans with a roughly 7,000-person lead in registered voters over Democrats out of 311,000 voters overall. That’s up from a registered voter lead of just over 1,000 in 2020. Unaffiliated voters not registered with a party make up roughly a third of the Washoe rolls.
Like their counterparts across the country, Nevada Republicans hold widely-varied views on their nominee. To the diehards, Donald Trump is a messianic figure. To others, he’s too controversial.
“I would have to say that the majority of the Republicans in Washoe County are on board with President Trump,” says Washoe GOP Chair Bruce Parks, who spoke with fellow Republicans at last weekend’s county convention. “There were not even a handful of people [there] that expressed dissatisfaction with President Trump, but they all said they vote for him anyway. Because they cannot in good conscience vote for anybody that would do what the current occupier of the White House has done to this country.”
Yet outside activist meetings like the county party convention, there are signs that Trump has work to do. In last month’s presidential primary, with Trump not on the ballot as he competed in the GOP caucuses instead, Nevada Republicans voted for “None of These Candidates” over Haley, 63% to 31% statewide. However, Haley did considerably better in battleground Washoe County, only losing 53%-40%.
It suggests at least some Republicans are looking for a more moderate figure. But Parks, a 20-year Army veteran who’s served as county party chair since 2021, isn’t looking for a middle-of-the-road Republican candidate.
“The moderate Republican philosophy as I’ve been able to discern means that we have to compromise our principles,” Parks insists. “There’s nothing wrong with compromise, as long as it’s for the good of the nation. But if we are compromising for the good of select groups or this lobbying organization or this pharmaceutical company, no. Absolutely no.”
The culling of moderates from the party is a red flag, according to Fred Lokken, a local political expert and professor of political science at Truckee Meadows Community College in Reno. “The party apparatus has been taken over by the extreme right. They’ve purged the party,” Lokken says.
Any Republican wavering in Washoe could be decisive come November. Reno Republican Eric Rampel is focusing on what each candidate has done when making his choice.
“How was America when President Trump was there?” Rampel said. “How’s America now that Biden’s there? And I’m leaning more towards Trump with those facts in front of me.”
With so much at stake in Washoe, Democrats are also priming their political machine for a push into Northern Nevada.
Maddy Pawlak, communications director for the Biden campaign in Nevada, told NBC News that while there are currently no Biden offices in the state’s northern counties, a “major ramp up” is coming within the next few weeks. “We’re building the organization we need to win here, and that includes Washoe County,” she said.
One area where the parties are preparing to do battle: mail-in ballots. Nevada is a universal mail-in voting state, which has proven popular with residents. In last month’s presidential primary, 85% of Washoe ballots came through the mail. (That figure does not count those who voted in-person at the Republican caucus.)
But while party officials nationally recognize the importance of using mail voting to bank votes and turn people out, Washoe Republican officials like Parks are unconvinced.
“I’m telling all our people: take your ballot to one of the polling places, drop it off in person. Do not under any circumstance for any reason put it in the mail,” Parks said.
That skepticism comes directly from the top of the ticket. During a Fox News interview with Laura Ingraham in February, Trump said without offering evidence, “If you have mail-in voting, you automatically have fraud.”
Yet Parks said he plans to get involved in the hunt for mail voters too: “We’re going to try to play the game if you will, better than they do.”

2024-03-06T16:09:37.513Z,"Nikki Haley ends presidential campaign with 'no regrets,' ceding GOP nomination to Trump",NBC News,"Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley dropped out of the 2024 presidential race Wednesday after losing every state but Vermont in Super Tuesday's primary contests, ceding the Republican nomination to former President Donald Trump.
Haley's decision to end her campaign effectively kicks off the general election, with Trump and President Joe Biden taking unofficial command of their parties early in primary season after a string of victories.
""I am filled with the gratitude for the outpouring of support we've received from all across our great country, but the time has now come to suspend my campaign,"" Haley said in a speech Wednesday morning. ""I said I wanted Americans to have their voices heard — I have done that. I have no regrets. And although I will no longer be a candidate, I will not stop using my voice for the things I believe in.""
Haley didn't announce an endorsement during her remarks Wednesday. Instead, she encouraged Trump, who is close to having the delegates needed to win the GOP nomination, to earn the support of Republicans and independent voters who backed her.
""It is now up to Donald Trump to earn the votes of those in our party and beyond it who did not support him, and I hope he does that,"" she said. ""At its best, politics is about bringing people into your cause, not turning them away. And our conservative cause badly needs more people. This is now his time for choosing.""
Haley said that being a private citizen is “privilege enough in itself” and that she looks forward to “enjoying in all likelihood” that Trump will be the Republican presidential nominee.
“I congratulate him and wish him well. I wish anyone well who would be America’s president,” she said. “Our country is too precious to let our differences divide us.”
In a statement on Haley’s withdrawal from the Republican presidential primary, President Joe Biden acknowledged the “courage” it took to “speak the truth” about her GOP opponent.
“It takes a lot of courage to run for President — that’s especially true in today’s Republican Party, where so few dare to speak the truth about Donald Trump,” he said. “Nikki Haley was willing to speak the truth about Trump: about the chaos that always follows him, about his inability to see right from wrong, about his cowering before Vladimir Putin.”
Biden also urged her supporters to support his re-election campaign.
“Donald Trump made it clear he doesn’t want Nikki Haley’s supporters. I want to be clear: There is a place for them in my campaign,” Biden said. “I know there is a lot we won’t agree on. But on the fundamental issues of preserving American democracy, on standing up for the rule of law, on treating each other with decency and dignity and respect, on preserving NATO and standing up to America’s adversaries, I hope and believe we can find common ground.”
In response to news of Haley dropping out of the race, Trump slammed his former challenger in a statement.
“Nikki Haley got TROUNCED last night, in record setting fashion, despite the fact that Democrats, for reasons unknown, are allowed to vote in Vermont, and various other Republican Primaries,” Trump said, referring to her only Super Tuesday victory in Vermont.
Trump then accused Haley of raising most of her money from Democrats and urged her supporters to get behind his presidential bid.
“At this point, I hope she stays in the “race” and fights it out until the end!” he said. “I’d like to thank my family, friends, and the Great Republican Party for helping me to produce, by far, the most successful Super Tuesday in HISTORY, and would further like to invite all of the Haley supporters to join the greatest movement in the history of our Nation.”
NBC News has projected a near-sweep for Trump in Tuesday's contests, with blowout results in every state except blue Vermont, where Haley won the state's delegates by a more than 4 percentage point margin, with about 96% of the expected votes in.
The Trump campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in an interview on Fox Business that she hoped Haley would endorse Trump ""considering again that voters and states across this country have made their choice very clear.”
""It is beyond time for Nikki Haley to get out of this race and to unify around the president,"" she said. ""He has been saying this for weeks, really for months. And so we encourage her to do just that, to adhere to the will of Republican voters.”
But as she turned hard against Trump in 2024 — and suffered a string of double-digit defeats in the early states, including in her home state of South Carolina — Haley resisted mounting pressure to drop out of the race, repeatedly insisting that more Americans deserved a choice.
Haley, a hand-picked member of Trump’s Cabinet from 2017 to 2018, was the first major Republican to launch a challenge against the former president more than a year ago. Her campaign had a slow start, but she gained momentum after multiple strong debate performances last summer and fall.
“I’m not giving up this fight when a majority of Americans disapprove of both Donald Trump and Joe Biden,” she said at her campaign’s watch party on the night of the South Carolina primary, adding that other states “have the right to a real choice, not a Soviet style election with only one candidate.”
But Republican primary voters made their choice, and Haley lost to Trump in all but one primary, Vermont, on Super Tuesday. Her only other victory was the low-turnout GOP primary in Washington, D.C.
While she kept her criticism of Trump measured for months in the originally crowded primary field, Haley upped her rhetoric after the New Hampshire primary — where she had one of her best showings with 43% — and the contest became a two-person race.
Haley told NBC last month that the former president was “diminished” and “unhinged,” explaining away her past support for Trump by bluntly saying “he is not the same person he was in 2016.”
By the end of her campaign, Haley was framing the primary in stark terms. “This is about, where exactly is the Republican Party gonna go?” she told rally attendees in Richmond, Virginia, on Feb. 29. Haley repeatedly brought up the party’s losses under Trump’s leadership and told her supporters that he “can’t win a general” election.
And she touted surveys like the Wall Street Journal’s December poll — which showed her with a big lead against Biden and Trump stuck in a closer race — at virtually every campaign event, framing herself as a more electable alternative for the GOP.
“I am giving you every red flag I possibly can about the direction that the country is going in. Now I just need people to hear it. I need states that are voting to act on it,” she said late last month to reporters in Grand Rapids, Michigan. “And I need to see that we can stop this sinking ship before it takes off.”
Although several 2024 GOP candidates gave their support for Trump after withdrawing from the race, Haley said last weekend that she no longer feels bound by a pledge she made to the Republican National Committee to support the party’s nominee.
“I think I’ll make what decision I want to make, but that’s not something I’m thinking about,” Haley said on NBC News’ “Meet the Press” about whether she will endorse Trump.
With her message of “new generational leadership,” Haley gained support from independents and even some Democrats — which led Trump and his allies to accuse her of not being conservative enough to be the party’s nominee.
“Not one person can tell you how I wasn’t conservative,” she said to reporters on Jan. 19th. “So you can go and say that I’m moderate. Show me where I’m moderate because I’m not.”
One of the issues that opened her up to this criticism was abortion, on which she struck a softer tone than most of the other GOP candidates running for president.
“As much as I’m pro-life, I don’t judge anyone for being pro-choice, and I don’t want them to judge me for being pro-life,” she said. “Let’s find consensus. … We don’t need to divide America over this issue anymore.”
While she called herself “unapologetically pro-life,” she long remained vague on what, if any, kind of federal abortion ban she would support, blaming the lack of support from 60 senators and calling instead for “consensus.”
“Can’t we say let’s ban late-term abortions? Can’t we say let’s encourage adoptions and good quality adoptions? Can’t we say that no doctor or nurse that doesn’t believe in abortion shouldn’t have to perform it?” she said in December in Davenport, Iowa. “Can’t we say that contraception should be accessible? And can’t we say that no state law should say to a woman who’s had an abortion that she’s going to jail or getting the death penalty. Let’s start there.”
Ultimately, her moderate- and independent-heavy coalition was not enough to overcome Trump’s strength in the Republican Party.
Before resigning in 2017 to join the Trump administration, Haley was the first female minority governor in the country in her home state of South Carolina. She previously served three terms in the South Carolina House of Representatives and before that was an accountant, which she often touted on the campaign trail.

2024-03-13T09:00:41.000Z,Chuck Todd: The big missing piece in Congress' rushed TikTok debate,NBC News,"An important aspect of the debate over TikTok has gotten lost as Congress considers legislation that would potentially force the app’s parent company, ByteDance, to sell TikTok or face a U.S. ban: the public’s privacy.
Unfortunately, the best-case scenario for this legislation is that the American people’s data will still be available for manipulation and used for algorithms with very little public insight into how they work.
Let’s back up to how we got here. I’m always a bit nervous when Congress goes from not acting on something for years to sudden near unanimity in a matter of days. Usually, there’s a hint of crisis in the air to get Congress to move as fast as it suddenly appears to be moving on TikTok.
So why now? Clearly, there are concerns about potential operational control of the TikTok algorithm on the part of the Chinese government. Given this is an election year and young voters are potentially so crucial to the outcome, fear of an outside entity’s influencing the election through TikTok should be something that the government can prevent.
Meanwhile, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence put out its annual report in time for this year’s worldwide threats hearing, which is happening in the midst of this TikTok debate. Among the warnings: that China is ramping up its covert operations and might attempt to influence the election by exploiting our country’s perceived societal divisions via social media.
Here is what the intelligence report noted publicly, even specifically name-checking TikTok:
(“PRC” is the People’s Republic of China.)
The national security establishment clearly explains the urgency. The question I have is: Why this specific law? And why are we letting off the hook every other social media platform that manipulates our data against our wishes (and, at times, against our democracy’s wishes)?
This bill appears to be an attempt to deal with TikTok and the presence of the Chinese government. Frustratingly, what this bill wouldn’t do is force TikTok or any online company to publicly inform people how their data is being used. This bill would do nothing about the abuse of private data on any platforms not named TikTok. In fact, if ByteDance does sell TikTok, the platform would be allowed to use its same opaque cloak to hide how our data is being used and manipulated to power it.
TikTok makes it nearly impossible to change what content you see or to alter the algorithm it has decided to use on you. That’s not going to change even if its ownership structure changes. And plenty of Americans are as uncomfortable with Mark Zuckerberg’s or Elon Musk’s having control of our data as they are with the Chinese Communist Party.
Ultimately, my fear about TikTok is the lack of control users have over the content they see. However TikTok vacuums up data from your phone the first time you download it is unclear. It’s also not clear how TikTok uses whatever data you do voluntarily give up, so it essentially comes up with a composite algorithm to serve you until it has accumulated enough actual data on you to personalize it even more, which is something that isn’t made clear at all to the average user.
Why is it so hard to force tech companies to be transparent at the start of their relationship with the customer about how they use your data and what options you have to take control of what they can do with it? There ought to be a law!
We’ve had strong laws on the books for decades regarding foreign ownership of legacy media: “Section 310(b)(3) prohibits foreign individuals, governments, and corporations from owning more than twenty percent of the capital stock of a broadcast, common carrier, or aeronautical radio station licensee.” It’s not immediately clear to me applying the same ownership rules we have for broadcast media wouldn’t be a more direct route to targeting TikTok.
When it comes to the internet, it is sometimes easier for lawmakers to start from scratch than to amend older telecommunications legislation. But as a member of so-called legacy media, I find it tiring to see internet-based media companies get to play by different rules and be held to different standards for no apparent reason. The competitive advantage lawmakers wanted to give this new technology has been realized and then some. To say Section 230 — the specific part of the 1996 telecommunications law that creates this legal carve-out for anyone operating a platform online — has outlived its usefulness is an understatement.
In practical terms, this is what the law means when it comes to paid advertising. A legacy broadcast media company like NBC is held responsible for TV ads on its air that knowingly mislead the public, even if they were created and paid for by third parties. Internet companies are protected from liability for spreading paid misinformation thanks to their longtime get-out-of-jail free card, Section 230.
In short: A political campaign can run an ad filled with falsehoods and misinformation on Facebook without Facebook’s being held accountable. If that same ad airs on a broadcast TV channel like NBC, ABC or CBS, the network is the one held accountable for airing it.
Obviously, there are a lot of folks advocating to treat online advertising the same as broadcast TV advertising, especially as online advertising is more prevalent in our day-to-day lives. But this TikTok legislation doesn’t deal with this issue. Not even close.
That’s just one example of how online media has gotten a pass on misinformation simply because Congress has either been unwilling or unable to update our laws. (Some lawmakers like that we’ve replaced one dominant media landscape with another — as long as they think they can get away with more.)
The tech companies also spend a ton of money lobbying Congress hoping — at a minimum — to simply gum things up. At this point, the strategy of the tech community is to keep Congress from acting, because a status quo, with Section 230 still in place untouched, keeps the money rolling in. It’s why many privacy advocates in the U.S. now are looking to the European Union to force the tech industry to protect users and their privacy.
Ultimately, we should demand legislation that protects and empowers users. Right now, the platforms have all the control. They all control what we see by using our preferences and make it either difficult or, in the case of TikTok, impossible to change (let alone control) the algorithms they use to deliver content to us.
Right now, the online companies want the onus to be on the user to decide what’s decent and what isn’t. You’ve seen those ads from Meta claiming it cares about our kids — and then they hope you’ve taken at least one computer science class in order to navigate its child protection tools. These companies ought to release the most secure versions of their platforms and then let users make it less secure (or more “adult”). It shouldn’t be the other way around.
Why is the burden on the user to tighten the protocols? I know the answer: advertising dollars. The more consumer content is limited, the more complicated (and less cash-flush) the ad business becomes for these platforms.
I remember a fight between students and the administration in college over a new “voluntary” student fee that was automatically included in our tuition bills, unless we proactively crossed the line item off our statements. The school knew a lot of folks would simply pay the entire balance without looking at the details about the extra voluntary fee.
As a student, I found it to be a shady practice — only to find out it was standard practice in just about every business in America, be it an internet company, a labor union, a hospital, a university or a hotel. (See, college does teach us life skills!)
The North Star of all tech legislation needs to be privacy. And if lawmakers write legislation that is always thinking about what protects users, then everyone involved will know they have to run their online platforms with data privacy as the North Star.
It’s not that way now. If anything, all most consumer-facing tech companies care about is our data. They come up with all sorts of ways to trick us into handing them access to our data, which they use to turn into propaganda on us. It’s a loop that can turn even the least paranoid among us into tinfoil-hat wearers.
While Congress is worried about foreign influence on TikTok, I sure hope it is also worried about countries who don’t share our values when they buy into our sports leagues (see the Qataris) or invest in other social media platforms like X (see the Saudis).
Congress should focus on our data on every platform, not just TikTok — putting its effort on the big picture when it comes to how much power our data has given to social media companies, whether TikTok, Meta, X, Snap or others. Focusing on one platform at a time is simply playing a game of whack-a-mole that the government (and we citizens) will inevitably lose.
This TikTok episode has also served to reveal just how transactional former President Donald Trump is when it comes to his personal beliefs. Once for banning the app, Trump is now against a ban, soon after meetings that included ByteDance investor and GOP megadonor Jeff Yass. (Trump told CNBC that TikTok didn’t come up in their conversation.)
The wash, rinse, repeat aspect of influencing Trump — who then influences the Trump base — is shockingly public for all of us to see. And it’s a playbook that every entity now has at its disposal. Present Trump with an offer — either politically helpful or financial — that’s high enough, and you can get him to change his tune. It may well be a “feature” of the Trump era that Trump embraces; he wants everyone to have to come to him first if they want anything from the GOP or the government. And if he makes himself pliable enough, it means he becomes the first stop for lobbyists, not the last one — which is how the GOP could become a kleptocracy if the party isn’t careful.
Trump doesn’t even hide it, which, of course, may actually be why he escapes punishment from a larger chunk of voters. If his words were “caught” on a recording via a White House taping system, for example, the public would recoil against him (like with Nixon). But because he doesn’t hide who he is, the blowback for his bad behavior seems to be minimal — or worse, accepted as an example of how business is done on the GOP side of the aisle.
In recent weeks, Trump has changed positions on two hot-button social issues (Bud Light and TikTok) after having met with someone connected to said controversial brand who also has the resources to help his campaign. Connecting these dots isn’t very difficult, and, again, it seems almost on purpose by Trump to advertise how best to “work” with him. Trump may not be the first politician who is for sale, but he’s among the most brazen, and it’s something that hasn’t stuck to him, at least not yet.
Of course, it’s so common for people in elective office to sell out their positions for either political or economic gain that it barely seems to register on the outrage meter. Look at Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J. He faces federal charges alleging he received bribes from two different foreign governments now, and it seems only Democratic Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania is outraged enough to call for his ouster from the Senate. The kid-gloves treatment of Menendez by his fellow Democrats right now is quite astonishing given how outraged the party wants Americans to be by the behavior of Trump.
I’m not trying to both-sides this, but not calling out bad behavior because it’s not worth the internal blowback only emboldens and empowers the Trumps of the world. Yes, we all live in glass houses, so let’s try repairing some of the windows, not just letting more glass shatter.
While Trump has decisively won the GOP nomination for president, in some places, there’s still a battle down the ballot over what direction the party should take. Toward the end of the shortened primary season, it was clear that Nikki Haley and Trump were pretty good at representing the two major competing factions of America’s right-of-center political party. Trump is the leader of the nationalist wing (some critics would call it isolationist or nativist), while Haley was the leader of the free market (think Chamber of Commerce types), internationalist wing, which some critics would call the “globalist” or “RINO” wing.
While the GOP electorate spoke out loud and clear for the side of Trump in the presidential primaries, a few down-ballot campaigns are still becoming sub-battles in this struggle between the two wings. Ohio’s Senate race might be ground zero for this debate, as Trump and his nationalist forces are fully behind Bernie Moreno, while the old guard, more Chamber of Commerce-aligned wing of the party is behind a wealthy scion, Matt Dolan.
The divides in this race are stark, particularly over issues like Ukraine and whether government should be small or strong. In the last Ohio Senate primary, the old guard stayed out of the race and let Trump essentially pick the nominee, now-Sen. JD Vance. This time, the old guard is uniting behind a non-Trump candidate, with both Gov. Mike DeWine and former Sen. Rob Portman lining up behind Dolan. Dolan ran against Vance in 2022 but didn’t have this level of outside support.
For those Republicans who hope to rebuild and redirect the party in a new direction post-Trump, a Dolan primary victory would be the start of a movement in that direction — should Trump lose the presidential race. But a Moreno victory would mean the Ohio GOP is most likely headed into the arms of Trump for the long haul, not just an election cycle or two. Whatever the outcome in this GOP Senate primary, it will matter a lot in the future of the GOP. And it’s certainly, for me, the most consequential GOP race to watch this cycle because of all the subtext involved.

2024-03-09T00:40:58.254Z,Biden kicks off post-State of the Union travel blitz in Pennsylvania,NBC News,"President Joe Biden kicked off a travel blitz Friday after his State of the Union address, heading to the critical swing state of Pennsylvania to drive home some of the key points he delivered during Thursday’s address.
The president’s speech in a solidly Democratic county almost immediately attacked former President Donald Trump. Biden criticized his record on reproductive rights issues and invoked a family affected by Alabama’s controversial state Supreme Court ruling that embryos are considered children, which prompted in vitro fertilization providers to halt services.
“Do you know why it happened? I’ll tell you why. One reason: Donald Trump,” Biden said Friday of that family’s paused IVF plans. “He came to office determined to overturn Roe v. Wade. In fact, he’s bragged about it repeatedly.”
The president then pivoted to issues including cooling inflation, lowering prescription drug prices and his demand to ban assault weapons.
“Too many corporations raise their prices and pad their profits, charging you more and more for less and less,” Biden said. “That’s why we’re cracking down on corporations engaged in price gouging and deceptive pricing.”
Biden also drew a contrast between his governing philosophy and Trump’s.
“My lifetime has taught me to embrace the future. I mean it sincerely: freedom, democracy, [and a] future based on the core values that have defined America,” Biden said. “Honesty, decency, fairness, equality.”
“Donald Trump sees the story differently,” Biden added. “He sees a story of resentment, revenge, retribution.”
The audience included people who have volunteered or worked for the Democratic Party, the Biden campaign or a similar organization. The high-energy crowd occasionally broke into chants of “four more years.”
Before the president’s speech, first lady Jill Biden delivered a forceful rebuke of her husband’s predecessor: “Donald Trump insults our veterans and disparages those who died in war, calling them ‘losers’ and ‘suckers.’ How dare he?”
“We must meet this moment as if our rights are at stake, because they are,” the first lady said. “As if our democracy is on the line, because it is.”
Aside from the State of the Union, Friday’s speech saw the largest audience for Biden since a January speech centered around abortion rights, which was interrupted more than a dozen times by anti-war protesters criticizing Biden’s response to the Israel-Hamas war.
The president’s speech kicks off what the campaign is calling a “month of action,” during which Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris will visit every battleground state.
Biden will visit Georgia on Saturday, New Hampshire on Monday, Wisconsin on Wednesday and Michigan on Thursday, according to the campaign. Meanwhile, Harris visited Arizona on Friday and will travel to Nevada on Saturday, zeroing in on mobilizing Latino voters.
Of those states, Biden flipped Georgia, Wisconsin, Michigan and Arizona blue in 2020.
The president’s Cabinet and senior administration officials are also fanning across the country this month, with more than two dozen trips to states including Texas, Ohio, Florida and New York, according to the White House.
The campaign announced on Friday that “Team Biden-Harris” will open 100 offices, onboard at least 350 new staffers in battleground states, and is launching a six-week, $30 million ad buy with “intentional and sizable buys into Hispanic, African American, and AANHPI outlets and radio,” according to the campaign. The campaign often uses “Team Biden-Harris” as a shorthand to refer to itself and affiliated groups, such as the Democratic National Committee.
The $30 million ad buy is in a similar range as certain super PAC ad spending this campaign cycle. The pro-Biden super PAC Future Forward has spent about $20.8 million, the pro-Trump super PAC MAGA Inc. has spent $39.5 million, the pro-Ron DeSantis super PAC Never Back Down spent about $40.2 million, and the pro-Nikki Haley super PAC SFA Fund spent $64.4 million, according to AdImpact.

2024-03-11T14:43:17.401Z,New $5 million ad campaign boosts House Democrats on health care,NBC News,"Fresh off of last week's State of the Union address, a liberal group is launching a $5 million ad campaign aimed at boosting nine Democratic congressional incumbents by connecting them to legislation aimed at lowering drug prices.
The group, Protect Our Care, will be running television, streaming and digital ads that applaud the lawmakers for measures passed by the Democratic-majority Congress in 2021 to cap insulin costs for Medicare recipients and to allow Medicare to negotiate some prescription drug prices.
The campaign starts Monday and will last a few months, the group told NBC News, including in-person organizing events on top of the advertising push.
“The best way to make sure Americans know about how their members of Congress lowered health care and prescription drug costs is to reach people where they are,” Protect Our Care chair Leslie Dach said in a statement.
“We are telling the American people how the Inflation Reduction Act is bringing down costs for working families and giving people economic relief and a little more breathing room. We urge these members of Congress to continue to lead the fight for reforms like the Lowering Drug Costs for American Families Act so more families can afford their medications.”
The ads come as Democrats mobilize for another election cycle in which they believe they can lean on the issue of health care to help them convince voters to back them. The Protect Our Care campaign comes amid a new flurry of Democratic spending: President Joe Biden’s campaign launched a $30 million ad campaign of its own after the State of the Union to boost the president ahead of his re-election, and he plans to travel the country this month.
Biden touts measures to lower prescription drug and insulin prices in his opening ad. The new Protect Our Care spots go into the same subject, pointing to portions of the Democrats' 2021 Inflation Reduction Act that caps the price of insulin for Medicare recipients and allows the federal government to negotiate some drug prices.
They feature a nurse celebrating the measures on drug prices, lamenting how her patients had been resorting to skipping medication in order to keep costs down.
""This will help so many of my patients afford the medicines they need,"" the nurse says in the spot. The ad goes on to call on Congress to pass new legislation aimed at providing additional health care savings for patients.
The new ads start airing Monday in the home districts of Democratic Reps. Yadira Caraveo of Colorado, Hillary Scholten of Michigan, Susan Wild of Pennsylvania, Matt Cartwright of Pennsylvania, Susie Lee of Nevada, Steven Horford of Nevada, Pat Ryan of New York and Gabe Vasquez of New Mexico.
Almost all of the members backed by the ad buy face potentially competitive general election fights this fall, when partisan control of the the House of Representatives will be up for grabs, especially considering that Republicans have a narrow majority in the body. Democrats could flip the House with a net gain of four seats in the fall, but Republicans are also pushing for gains to pad their majority.
Protect Our Care launched during the Trump administration, ahead of a 2018 midterms, when Democrats performed well amid a deep focus on the issue of health care. It's a nonprofit, which is why the ad promotes legislation instead of an explicitly political message.

2024-03-08T05:35:12.994Z,Biden stares down questions about his age and fitness for office with spirited speech,NBC News,"WASHINGTON — The message that Joe Biden most needed to deliver Thursday night wasn't so much that the American union is strong but that the American president is fit.
It's not the highest bar, but it's one that he cleared.
Amid polls showing that most of the country believes he is too old to serve another four-year term, Biden stood for 68 minutes in the House chamber and gave a speech that was both energetic and crisp. He then set a modern presidential record for the time spent shaking hands and giving hugs in the chamber afterward.
Biden spoke with fluency about the stakes in the presidential race, never mentioning former President Donald Trump by name but making more than a dozen references to his ""predecessor."" The first came just three minutes into the speech, when Biden skewered Trump for inviting Russian President Vladimir Putin to attack NATO allies who don't contribute enough money to the alliance.
Drawing a distinction, Biden said: ""My message to President Putin is simple. We will not walk away. We will not bow down. I will not bow down.""
Biden flubbed a few prepared lines and stumbled a bit during ad-libs — notably when he said drug prices in Moscow are lower than in the U.S. — but he belied the GOP caricature of him as an enfeebled old man who needs to retire.
“No one’s going to talk about cognitive memory now,” Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., told the president after he finished the speech and made his way out of the House chamber.
That was, of course, the idea when Biden's speechwriters worked on the draft. The prepared text included 80 exclamation points — cuing Biden to when he needed to raise his voice and project strength. By contrast, there were no exclamation points in last year's text.
It's too soon to tell whether Biden's address will make an enduring impression on voters who may have been watching. The Biden campaign is likely to repurpose snippets of the speech in which he was his most eloquent, while Republicans may showcase instances when he tripped over a word.
What didn't happen Thursday night, though, may be the biggest takeaway. Biden, 81, didn't stumble as he walked through the chamber — as some of his allies feared might happen. Nor did he freeze as he read the teleprompter or get rattled when Republicans jeered him. Indeed, at times he seemed to goad Republicans into unscripted back-and-forth.
Urging Congress to revive a border security bill that House Republicans scuttled, Biden gazed out at Republican members and said: ""You're saying no. Look at the facts. I know you know how to read.""
Heckling can test a president’s wits and alacrity in its own way. Aides were thrilled last year as Biden turned Republican derision to his advantage. When Republicans hooted that they didn’t intend to cut Social Security and Medicare, as Biden had claimed, he ad-libbed that the boos must mean they, too, wanted to protect the entitlement programs.
Biden's challenge Thursday night was to ""convince people that he’s got the strength, energy, vigor and focus to be an effective president,"" Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., said in an interview in the hours before the speech.
Gone is the era when a State of the Union speech served as a unifying national event. Over the years it has devolved into a televised drama in which the president and the opposing party, arrayed before him on the House floor, grasp for ways to gain ground at each other’s expense.
Jeff Shesol, a speechwriter in Bill Clinton’s White House, said in an interview, “Part of the game really is to make sure that you’re writing some lines and sections that are forcing the other party, against its better instincts, to stand and applaud — or to force them to remain seated while the rest of you applaud apple pie and the American flag.""
The night had a partisan feel from the first. Biden looked taken aback when he entered the chamber and made eye contact with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., wearing a bright red ""Make America Great Again"" hat. (House rules prohibit wearing caps in the chamber.)
At the lectern, he suggested he was on the side of democratic freedoms while Trump was among those who wanted to ""bury the truth"" about the riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, when Trump supporters nearly prevented the peaceful transfer of power.
After he said his core values include “honesty, decency, dignity and equality,” Biden added: “Now, some other people my age see a different story: an American story of resentment, revenge and retribution. That’s not me.” In one breath, he sought to neutralize questions about his age while painting Trump as a menace to a functioning democracy.
The speech came later in the year than usual, and it came close to being pushed back even more.
House Republican leaders were prepared to move the date of the speech in case Congress failed to reach a budget deal, forcing a partial government shutdown, a House GOP leadership aide said.
GOP leaders didn’t want to give Biden a chance to berate them about a shutdown as millions of Americans watched from home, the aide said. It turned out that Congress reached a budget deal averting a shutdown, so the date wasn’t changed.
“We were thinking about moving the speech because you don’t want to give him [Biden] something to beat up on us for an hour,” the House aide said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal strategy.
With the campaign now fully engaged, the White House sought to wring maximum advantage from the speech. Aides stocked the gallery with people symbolizing the key components of the Democratic coalition. Guests invited to sit with first lady Jill Biden included Kate Cox of Texas, who needed to leave the state to get a doctor-recommended abortion after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade; Shawn Fain, the president of the United Auto Workers labor union; and Bettie Mae Fikes, a civil rights advocate who was part of the Bloody Sunday march in Selma, Alabama, in 1965.
Biden made sure to name-check them during the address.
Whether those sorts of gestures are remembered in the fall is by no means certain. Terry Szuplat, a speechwriter for President Barack Obama, pointed to the irony of State of the Union addresses. For all the work that goes into them, they're often quickly forgotten.
""It's the greatest platform a president has, and it often becomes the least memorable speeches of his presidency,"" he said.

2024-03-12T20:05:52.005Z,Trump plans to lean on attorneys' involvement in hush-money payments as part of trial defense,NBC News,"In his upcoming hush-money trial, former President Donald Trump intends to argue that he didn’t think he was doing anything wrong because various lawyers were involved with the underlying conduct that gave rise to the charges against him.
Trump attorneys said in a New York criminal court filing made public Tuesday that part of his defense will be that he ""lacked the requisite intent to commit the conduct charged in the indictment.""
“President Trump intends to elicit these facts from witnesses ... whom we expect will testify about President Trump’s awareness of counsel’s involvement in the charged conduct. This is not a formal advice-of-counsel defense,” his lawyers wrote.
It’s not a foregone conclusion that the judge overseeing the case will allow Trump to present evidence of his lawyers’ involvement without expressly invoking the advice of counsel defense.
Trump has been hit with 34 charges related to allegations that he covered up a $130,000 payment that his then-attorney Michael Cohen made to adult film star Stormy Daniels in the closing days of the 2016 presidential campaign. The payment was intended to have Daniels keep quiet about a sexual encounter she said she had with Trump in 2006. Trump has denied that he slept with Daniels, but he has acknowledged repaying Cohen.
Prosecutors from the Manhattan district attorney's office say Trump falsified the documentation surrounding payments to Cohen. Trump has pleaded not guilty. Jury selection is scheduled to begin March 25.
Trump had said he planned to use an ""advice of counsel"" defense, and Judge Juan Merchan had told his attorneys to notify the DA's office by this week if he intended to take that approach. The DA's office had requested notice because under that line of argument they would be entitled to more information about Trump's communications with his attorneys.
In Tuesday's filing, Trump's lawyers said they would ask Cohen and other people who'd been involved in the Daniels discussions about Trump's ""awareness of counsel's involvement."" But, they added, they wouldn't use a formal advice of counsel defense, so there's no need for them to make more evidence available to Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office.
“While President Trump intends to elicit evidence concerning the presence, involvement and advice of lawyers in relevant events giving rise to the charges in the Indictment, he does not intend to assert a formal advice-of-counsel defense,"" Trump's attorneys wrote.
In a court filing made public Monday, Trump's lawyers asked Merchan to delay the trial until after the U.S. Supreme Court issues a decision about the scope of presidential immunity in the federal election interference case in Washington, D.C. The DA's office is expected to formally oppose that request in the coming days.

2024-03-06T17:34:18.073Z,Bill that could ban TikTok in the U.S. gains momentum in Congress,NBC News,"WASHINGTON — Nearly a year after TikTok’s CEO was grilled on Capitol Hill, House Republicans and Democrats are joining together on legislation that would force its parent company, China-based ByteDance, to divest the popular social media company or risk the U.S.’s banning it from app stores.
The bill is co-authored by the bipartisan leaders of the select committee on the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., and ranking member Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., who also serve on the Intelligence Committee. Both lawmakers recently returned from a visit to Taiwan and the greater Indo-Pacific region.
The White House has signaled support for the bill while stopping short of endorsing it.
On Thursday, the Energy and Commerce Committee, led by Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., plans to mark up the bipartisan bill and pass it, sending it to the House floor for a future vote. She said her committee has kept leadership ""in the loop"" and been closely working with the White House on the bill. Administration officials have provided technical assistance on the bill, she said.
“It’s a very narrow, targeted bill that we’ve worked very hard to build bipartisan support,” McMorris Rodgers told reporters. “This is about protecting Americans.”
The bill, dubbed the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, would create a process for the president — through the FBI and intelligence agencies — to identify certain social media applications under the control of foreign adversaries, like China, Russia, Iran and North Korea, as national security threats.
Once an app was deemed a risk, it would be banned from online app stores and web-hosting services unless it severed ties with entities under control of the foreign adversary within 180 days of the designation. That would mean TikTok, which FBI Director Christopher Wray has testified poses a risk to national security, could face a potential ban unless ByteDance acts quickly to divest it.
U.S. lawmakers and intelligence officials are concerned that the Chinese government could use TikTok to access personal data from its more than 150 million users and show them videos that could influence their views on particular issues, including the coming presidential election. Testifying before Congress, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew has denied that the Chinese government controls the app and pushed back against suggestions that China accesses U.S. user data.
""This bill is an outright ban of TikTok, no matter how much the authors try to disguise it,” a TikTok spokesperson said in a statement. “This legislation will trample the First Amendment rights of 170 million Americans and deprive 5 million small businesses of a platform they rely on to grow and create jobs.”
Speaking to reporters Wednesday, Gallagher argued that he and other co-sponsors are not trying to ban the enormously popular or trying to quash free speech.
“It is not a ban. Think of this as a surgery designed to remove the tumor and thereby save the patient in the process,” Gallagher said.
“If you value your personal freedom and privacy online, if you care about Americans’ national security at home, and yes, even if you want TikTok to stick around in the United States,” he said, “this bill offers the only real step toward each of those goals.”
The White House has signaled strong support for the bipartisan measure, though it's still eyeing some changes. A National Security Council spokesperson said the Biden administration has worked with lawmakers in both parties “to arrive at a durable legislative solution that would address the threat of technology services operating in the United States in a way that poses risks to Americans’ sensitive data and our broader national security. This bill is an important and welcome step to address that threat.”
The NSC official applauded Gallagher and Krishnamoorthi’s work on the issue and said, “We look forward to working with Congress to further strengthening this legislation to put it on the strongest possible legal footing.”
“The President additionally urges Congress to do its part and pass comprehensive bipartisan privacy legislation, especially to protect the safety of our children,” the official said in a statement.
Krishnamoorthi, the top Democrat on the China panel, was pressed Wednesday about why the Biden re-election campaign is using TikTok if it’s a national security threat.
“I’m not going to tell him how to campaign. I don’t have a TikTok account on my personal device. And it’s, you know, it’s banned on public devices here in Congress,” Krishnamoorthi said. “I would just say, look, we know what the facts are. And I would just ask people to be very careful and cautious in using it.”

2024-03-10T14:17:46.925Z,Lindsey Graham: Biden has 'screwed the world up every way you can',NBC News,"South Carolina GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham on Sunday said that President Joe Biden “has screwed the world up every way you can.”
Graham argued on NBC News’ “Meet the Press” that Biden has perpetuated “broken borders” and that “the world’s on fire.” When moderator Kristen Welker mentioned Biden’s statement Friday that he regretted using the term “an illegal” to describe Jose Antonio Ibarra, a Venezuelan who crossed the border into the U.S. and who has been charged in the murder of Laken Riley, Graham interjected to say that the reversal “really pisses me off.”
The South Carolina Republican has crossed party lines to praise Biden on foreign policy in the past, applauding Biden’s efforts to normalize Israel-Saudi Arabia relations in December.
Graham is a supporter of former President Donald Trump’s campaign, but he has broken with him on several issues, including Ukraine aid.
Pressed by Welker about a quote from fellow GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska in which she said, “Let’s just not even exist as a Senate then if we have to ask permission from Donald Trump for everything we do,” Graham disputed the notion that Trump “calls the shots” in the Senate.
“I’ve voted against things that, you know, he doesn’t like,” Graham said, adding: “The point is, to Lisa: Would you support the idea that our allies should pay us back if they can when we’re $34 trillion in debt?”
He referenced his support for providing more aid to Ukraine in its war with Russia, but only in the form of a loan that Ukraine would pay back after the war.
“This is ‘America First’ in action. It’s not isolationism, but it is considering the needs of the American people,” Graham added, referencing a term Trump often invokes to describe his approach to foreign policy.
He also spoke about his support for Ukraine, saying, “I hope to be going to Ukraine soon and I hope to tell them, ‘The aid is coming.’”
Graham also responded to questions about the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, saying, “I literally about fell out of my seat” during the president’s State of the Union address to Congress on Thursday when Biden said Hamas could end the conflict by releasing all of the hostages they took on Oct. 7.
“Is the president saying that if the hostages are released by Hamas, they can stay in power?” Graham asked on Sunday.
“President Trump believes it’s non-negotiable when it comes to Hamas. They have to be destroyed militarily. They can’t be in charge. So I’m challenging the Biden administration today to clear this up. You cannot allow Hamas to stay in power,” Graham added.
The White House did not immediately respond to NBC News’ request for comment.
Graham also questioned Biden’s mental fitness, calling on him to “get in a room with [former President] Donald Trump and debate.”
“If there’s ever an election in the history of America that deserves a debate between two candidates, it’s this election,” Graham told “Meet the Press.”
He said he’s spoken with the Trump campaign, which Graham said told him that Trump is ready to debate “anytime, anywhere,” a phrase that the former president’s campaign has used before when calling for debates with Biden.
The Biden campaign hasn’t ruled out general election debates, but it also hasn’t firmly committed to Biden debating Trump.
As the president was departing Washington for Philadelphia on Friday, he told reporters, “It depends on [Trump’s] behavior,” in response to questions about whether he’ll debate the former president.

2024-03-06T22:12:29.191Z,Biden and Trump are already battling for Haley's voters: From the Politics Desk,NBC News,"Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team’s latest reporting and analysis from the campaign trail, the White House and Capitol Hill.
In today’s edition, Allan Smith and Ali Vitali, who reported extensively on Nikki Haley's presidential campaign, dig into the battle to win over her supporters. Plus, Chuck Todd explains why the next weeks could be a critical stretch as Joe Biden and Donald Trump turn toward a general election rematch.
Nikki Haley’s campaign is over, but the fight to win over her supporters has just begun.
With Donald Trump and Joe Biden essentially set in stone as their parties’ presidential nominees, the Haley voting bloc will now have to come to terms with a choice many wished they wouldn’t have to make.
And Trump and Biden’s initial pitches to these voters couldn’t sound more different.
Do you have a news tip? Let us know
Trump wrote on Truth Social that Haley “got TROUNCED” on Super Tuesday “in record setting fashion,” adding, “Much of her money came from Radical Left Democrats, as did many of her voters.” Later, he said he “would further like to invite all of the Haley supporters to join the greatest movement in the history of our Nation.”
Meanwhile, Biden said in a statement: “Donald Trump made it clear he doesn’t want Nikki Haley’s supporters. I want to be clear: There is a place for them in my campaign.”
What’s more, a Biden campaign official told NBC News the finance teams for Biden and the Democratic National Committee have recently done outreach to Haley donors, including efforts led by Hollywood mogul and Biden national co-chair Jeffrey Katzenberg.
Haley’s coalition was bolstered by crossover voters jumping into open primaries looking to stick it to Trump. While they made up the minority in the GOP primary, strategists on both sides acknowledged that a segment of her supporters could prove key in close battleground states.
NBC News exit polling on Super Tuesday showed stark divides between Trump and Haley backers on key questions. In Virginia and North Carolina, roughly half of Haley’s supporters said they approved of Biden’s job performance as president — higher than the public as a whole. On the other hand, virtually none of Trump’s backers approved of Biden’s performance.
A New York Times/Siena College poll released Saturday showed nearly half of Haley’s supporters — 48% — voted for Biden in 2020, versus 31% who said they backed Trump then.
And as NBC News’ Steve Kornacki wrote, Trump’s poor performance with independent voters in early GOP primaries may be more the result of “resistance”-leaning independents being motivated to participate in them than a reflection of the opinions of independent voters overall.
Still, there may be a group of Haley voters now looking for a home who could prove pivotal to either candidate’s coalition — particularly voters who dislike both men or have concerns about their advanced age.

This general election is going to be nasty. It’s going to be personal. And by the time the two campaigns are done pummeling each other, I suspect Trump supporters are going to assume Biden is at death’s door, while Biden supporters are going to assume the Constitution will be suspended the day of a second Trump inauguration.
The real question, of course, is which negative attacks will actually stick in the minds of voters who aren’t hard partisans and aren’t predisposed to assume the worst about both candidates. And the next six weeks should tell us a lot about how much a paid anti-Trump media campaign can move Biden’s numbers.
Given the financial advantage Biden enjoys over Trump, it would be malpractice if the Biden campaign didn’t try to press that advantage immediately. Right now, this campaign has a “referendum on Biden” vibe to it, a fairly natural occurrence at this point in an incumbent’s re-election effort. The challenger — in this case Trump — is the one constantly on the trail and in the news, and his victories are giving him a bit of a “winner’s” halo effect.
Just ask Presidents Dukakis, Romney and Kerry how long that lasts, though. All had moments when they appeared to have successfully made the campaign about the other guy (and their party). That is, until the incumbent’s campaign had its say and started to spend its money.
One of the hallmarks of Trump’s campaigns is his ability to project his own weaknesses on his opponent. One of the more effective hits on Trump is to portray him as a chaos agent, unable or unwilling to prevent, say, a Jan. 6 protest from turning into a full-on insurrection. Of course, Trump knows this — which is why he regularly portrays the border or things happening overseas as “chaotic” or “out of control” on Biden’s watch.
I’m curious to see how Biden’s team navigates this attempt at inoculation. One of the great challenges it has is convincing the middle of the electorate to vote for Biden a second time, arguing that this time, the chaos Biden pledged to put behind the nation in 2020 will truly end. Will these voters believe that?

2024-03-11T21:17:20.435Z,Trump likely to attend hearing in classified documents case on Thursday: court filing,NBC News,"Former President Donald Trump is expected to attend a hearing Thursday in the federal criminal case involving his handling of classified documents in Florida, where his attorneys will argue the case should be thrown out.
Trump is not required to be at the hearing in Fort Pierce, but his lawyers indicated he and his two co-defendants would attend in a court filing Monday, where they asked for extra time to respond to some other outstanding motions in the case.
""The reasons for this request are that (1) the Defendants and counsel need to travel to Fort Pierce prior to March 14 in order to participate in the hearing, which is time we would otherwise use to prepare the other reply submissions; (2) President Trump and counsel need to spend time preparing for the oral argument, which is time we would otherwise use to prepare the other reply submissions,"" the filing said.
They also said that the former president and his attorneys are preparing for the March 25 start date of his New York criminal trial ""and the need to simultaneously devote attention to that case and this matter has been necessitated in part"" by the ""strategic scheduling demands of the Special Counsel’s Office.""
A short time after their Monday filing, Trump’s attorneys filed a separate one in New York, seeking to have the trial there delayed until Trump’s presidential immunity claims are decided by the U.S. Supreme Court.
Trump's Florida filing did not mention the request he was making in New York, but a response from special counsel Jack Smith's office later Monday cited the document in a filing to the Trump-appointed judge who's presiding over the Florida case, U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon.
Smith's filing urged Cannon to deny Trump's request for a delay, arguing it's ""mostly based on circumstances about which they have been aware"" for a long period of time, including the New York trial date.
Cannon has said that Thursday's hearing is expected to take all day.
Trump’s legal team and prosecutors from Smith's office are expected to argue their positions on whether some or all of the charges against Trump should be thrown out because of the Presidential Records Act before the case goes to trial.
Smith has urged Cannon to reject Trump’s claims that his presidential records “can be transformed into ‘personal’ records” upon being removed from the White House.
The two sides will also discuss a second motion to dismiss the case on the theory that the main statute used against Trump is unconstitutionally vague as it applies to presidents.
Trump faces dozens of criminal charges in the case, including willful retention of national defense information, false statements and representations, conspiracy to obstruct justice, withholding a document or record and corruptly concealing a document. He has pleaded not guilty to all counts.
The case is currently scheduled to go to trial on May 20, but Cannon is expected to push back the trial date.
Trump, who did not attend a trial in writer E. Jean Carroll’s defamation case against him last year, has been appearing in court on a more frequent basis in recent months, even though he is often not required to.
He attended most of a trial in Carroll’s second defamation case against him earlier this year, and late last year attended several days of the monthslong civil fraud trial brought against him and his company by New York Attorney General Letitia James.

2024-03-14T13:23:58.049Z,Kamala Harris seeks to shore up Latino voter support by touting economic gains,NBC News,"Fresh from a swing through Western states, Vice President Kamala Harris told NBC News there are reasons for Latino voters to be optimistic about the economy and jobs, even if they are not feeling the upswing yet.
Harris’ trip to Arizona, Nevada and Colorado was intended to hammer home President Joe Biden’s State of the Union message with Latino voters and shore up their support.
The vice president, who met with Hispanic supporters last week and early this week, said that wages have outpaced inflation and that inflation is headed downward. She touted the creation of millions of jobs and low unemployment, including among Hispanics.
""The numbers tell us that the economy is stronger than it has been in a very long time ... it takes time for those accomplishments to be felt,"" she said in a phone interview Wednesday.
Harris touted Biden administration policies that she said have benefited Latino families, including a cap on prescription drugs on seniors and a cap on insulin prices, which has had a direct impact on Latinos, who are 70% more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes than non-Hispanic whites.
She noted that the administration's more than $1 billion student loan debt forgiveness has helped many first-generation students, including Latinos, and its investment in community banks has boosted lending to Latino small businesses.
Harris said ""our challenge is we just need to let people know who brought it to them.”
But the campaign faces an uphill climb to reassure Latino voters that they are seeing better economic times. In recent years, many Latino and Black households have spent bigger shares of their household budgets on goods where inflation was highest, such as food and rent. That followed a couple of years of job and income losses when the Covid pandemic forced businesses to close.
An NBC News poll conducted in late January showed Biden’s approval rating at just 35% among Latino registered voters. Biden and former President Donald Trump were tied among Latino voters (Trump 42% and Biden 41%) who were asked whom they would vote for in a rematch.
In 2020, Biden won 65% of Latino votes, compared to 32% for Trump.
The economy and jobs were ranked as their top concerns in a December survey of more than 3,000 Latinos eligible to vote by UnidosUS, an advocacy group.
Arturo Vargas, executive director of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, said that the ""economy is top of mind"" in this election cycle, and that it's not just what polls are showing, ""but what I'm seeing and I'm hearing and people are reacting to.""
In 2024, about 22% of Latinos will be voting in their first presidential election. Almost a quarter (24%) of Latino voters between the ages of 18 and 29 voted for the first time in 2022, according to the  Brookings Institution, a liberal think tank.
A 2024 UnidosUS survey of 1,500 Latino parents or caregivers of children ages 5 and under, reported that 30% said they were doing better than last year, a third said their situation was the same and 37% said they were doing worse. The survey had a 2.5% margin of error.
Harris said that ""there's still more work to be done"" in a second presidential term, naming homeownership and rent reduction, as well as lower child care and home health care costs, as priorities.
The current levels of migration at the border and its repercussions on U.S. cities have become top voter concerns in the 2024 election cycle and one of Trump's top point of attacks against Biden.
Harris said that immigration is one issue on the November ballot where the choice between candidates is ""binary.""
Trump has said immigrants poison the blood of America,  he has ""killed"" the bipartisan border bill and has said that he would carry out a mass deportation operation, she said.
In contrast, Harris said, soon after Biden's inauguration, he proposed a bill that included a pathway to citizenship for eligible immigrants that Republicans would not take up.
""The reality is they would prefer to run on the problem, which is a broken immigration system, instead of fixing it,"" she said. ""We have people who have 10, 20 years living a very productive life, paying taxes, contributing to the economy who have no pathway to citizenship because the pathway is so broken.""
A recent Pew Research survey found that about three-quarters of Hispanics view the growing migration across the U.S.-Mexico border as a major problem or crisis and roughly the same share believe the federal government is doing a bad job of handling it.
Latinos, however, are less likely than other Americans to see more deportations and more border wall as effective responses, according to the survey.
Speaking to NBC News a day before visiting an abortion clinic in Minnesota — a first for a president or vice president, Harris said reproductive rights is an issue on which she believes she and Biden have a majority of Latino voter support, citing that 40% of Latinas live in a state with an abortion ban.
A Pew Research survey found that a majority of Latinos (57%) say abortion should be legal in at least some cases, including 69% of Democrats or those leaning Democrat and 39% of Hispanic Republicans or those leaning Republican.

2024-03-13T19:37:36.124Z,Kamala Harris will host a marijuana reform event with Fat Joe,NBC News,"WASHINGTON — Vice President Kamala Harris will hold the administration's first public event on marijuana reform this week after President Joe Biden addressed the issue as one of his priorities in last week's State of the Union address.
Harris will convene a roundtable discussion in the West Wing, featuring Grammy-nominated artist Fat Joe, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and individuals who received pardons for prior cannabis convictions.
Harris’ main portfolio includes reproductive health care, gun violence and voting rights, but she has consistently amplified criminal justice reform since her years as a district attorney in California.
In his State of the Union Thursday, Biden said that he had directed his “cabinet to review the federal classification of marijuana,” adding that he is also “expunging thousands of convictions for the mere possession, because no one should be jailed for simply using.”
Biden’s comments were notable, marking the first time he spoke about the effort to reschedule marijuana since he directed agencies in October 2022 to examine its classification within the Drug Enforcement Agency. It was also the first time Biden mentioned the drug during a speech as critical as an election-year State of the Union.
Two aides close to the vice president, and an additional source with familiar with her role, said Harris will continue to bring awareness to the issue in the coming months, with events that highlight expungements — especially as the reelection campaign seeks the support of critical young voters and voters of color.
""Friday’s engagement will build on the Vice President’s efforts to uplift the historic actions the Biden-Harris Administration has taken to ensure everyone has access to opportunity, including by making the criminal justice system more just. This will continue in the weeks and months to come,"" a White House official said.
The Biden campaign launched a core part of that outreach effort in its “Students for Biden-Harris” rollout earlier this week. While young people identify plenty of issues that are most important to them — including abortion access, the economy and gun violence — cannabis reform is also a significant concern.
According to a national poll commissioned by the Coalition for Cannabis Scheduling Reform, the overwhelming majority of 18-to-25 year-old likely voters (65%) expressed support for Biden’s efforts to reschedule cannabis, and 70% of Americans support federal marijuana legalization — the highest percentage ever.
The White House announced its major initiatives on the topic, including directing agencies to evaluate rescheduling the drug, just weeks before the 2022 midterm elections.
“Too many lives have been upended because of our failed approach to marijuana. It’s time that we right these wrongs,” Biden said in a statement at the time.
In August, the Department of Health and Human Services formally recommended that the Department of Justice reclassify cannabis from Schedule 1 to 3, for the first time acknowledging the medical benefits of cannabis, which has been in the same category as heroin and LSD since the Controlled Substances Act was enacted in 1971.
Drugs classified under Schedule 1 are substances that officials say have no accepted form of medical use and have a high potential for abuse. Marijuana ranks higher in the CSA than fentanyl and cocaine, despite 40 states and Washington, D.C., having legalized some form of cannabis, for either recreational or medical use.
The DEA has been conducting a review of the HHS recommendation for months but has yet to issue an opinion, though one is expected this spring according to two sources with knowledge. Once that opinion is issued, a public review period is expected — a process that could take up to 60 days.
The grid-locked Congress could also make some progress on cannabis reform this year, with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer telling reporters last week that the bipartisan SAFER Banking Act — a bill that would expand access to traditional banking and financial institutions for legal cannabis businesses — could get a vote on the floor before the November election.

2024-03-06T21:22:05.044Z,House passes first funding package to avert a partial government shutdown,NBC News,"WASHINGTON — The House easily passed a package of six spending bills Wednesday, teeing up a vote in the Senate to pass the legislation and avert a partial government shutdown by Friday’s deadline.
The 1,050-page bill would keep parts of the government — including the Agriculture, Commerce, Interior, Justice and Transportation departments — open through September. The package, known as a minibus, comprises six appropriations bills that were negotiated between the Republican-led House and the Democratic-controlled Senate and backed by President Joe Biden.
Passing the first tranche of funding bills is the easy part. House and Senate appropriators must next negotiate a deal for the six remaining spending bills ahead of a separate March 22 shutdown deadline. Those bills fund the Defense, State and Homeland Security departments, among other agencies and programs, and are expected to be more highly contested.
The package was passed Wednesday using a fast-track process, known as suspending the rules, that required a higher two-thirds majority to pass. The vote was 339-85.
All 100 senators would need to agree to hold a quick vote on the package to avert a partial shutdown beginning at 12:01 a.m. Saturday.
Hard-right lawmakers lambasted the package and voted against it, arguing that it would do little to cut spending and excluded their favored conservative policy riders.
""It’s a mistake. I think the American people don’t want to see us again spend more money, rack up more debt. We’re $34.4 trillion in debt. ... We’re now at $1 trillion in interest, and we’re going to spend more money to fund more programs, undermining the American people?"" asked Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, a member of the far-right Freedom Caucus, which opposed the package.
""I keep waiting for the fight that I keep getting told is going to happen tomorrow, right?"" Roy continued. ""It’s like ... one of these losing sports teams says wait till next year, right? 'Oh, trust me, elect us in November. We’ll do it. Next time.' How about we do it now?""
But Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., defended the bipartisan spending deal, saying the political “reality” is that there is divided government in Washington and a minuscule, two-vote GOP majority, “one of the smallest in history in the House.” Johnson allies have noted it’s the first time since 2018 that the government hadn’t been funded through one massive omnibus package.
And Johnson said he’s eager to begin negotiations on the next round of spending bills, for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1.
“You can’t turn an aircraft carrier overnight. So what we did was we broke the omnibus fever,” Johnson told reporters at his weekly news conference. “We’re very happy now that we’re finally to the point we can move beyond — get FY ’24 done and then turn our attention to FY ’25.”
In recent months, Roy and other conservative rebels have floated the possibility of forcing a vote to oust Johnson over his handling of spending negotiations. But despite deep frustrations, Freedom Caucus members are shying away from those threats — at least for now.
“I’m not going to bring Johnson into this. We’re continuing to meet with him,” said one of those Freedom Caucus members, Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C. “But it’s irresponsible for this House to pass this minibus. It’s irresponsible to spend the kind of dollars that they’re spending.""
The spending package passed Wednesday represents a series of painstaking compromises that came nearly halfway through the fiscal year after four stopgap bills to extend a series of shutdown deadlines. Both parties highlighted what they saw as key wins.
Republicans touted cuts to the FBI, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; more funding for the Drug Enforcement Administration; measures to bolster gun rights for veterans; and restrictions on oil sales to China.
Meanwhile, Democrats cheered the fact that the bill would fully fund the “WIC” program — food assistance for women, infants and children — as well as provide rental assistance, a pay raise for firefighters and investments in new air traffic controllers.

2024-03-14T09:00:40.000Z,Democrats prepare to go to war against third-party candidates,NBC News,"The Democratic National Committee is building its first team to counter third-party and independent presidential candidates, people involved told NBC News, as the party and its allies prepare for a potential all-out war on candidates they view as spoilers.
The DNC has hired veteran Democratic operative Lis Smith, best known for her work guiding the 2020 presidential campaign of Pete Buttigieg, to help oversee an aggressive communications component of its strategy, which also includes opposition research and legal challenges.
Underscoring how important Democrats view the effort, it is being overseen by Mary Beth Cahill and Ramsey Reid, two veteran DNC insiders, who have already started issuing rare public statements rebuking Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
Matt Corridoni, Smith’s former deputy on the Buttigieg campaign and most recently a top aide to Rep. Jake Auchincloss, D-Mass., is also joining the team as a spokesperson.
“We’re facing an unprecedented election and we know the GOP is already working to prop up third-party candidates like Robert Kennedy Jr. to make them stalking horses for Donald Trump,” Corridoni told NBC News. “With so much on the line, we’re not taking anything for granted. We’re going to make sure voters are educated and we’re going to make sure all candidates are playing by the rules.”
The move comes as a coalition of outside groups — which includes Democratic and anti-Trump Republican organizations — stockpile money and work to stymie third parties.
“There is some Jill Stein hangover,” Pat Dennis, president of American Bridge, a Democratic opposition research group, said referring to the 2016 Green Party nominee who was seen as a spoiler in places like Michigan. “A lot of people, including me, regret that we didn’t go after her further.”
Democrats have long blamed Green Party candidates such as Stein and Ralph Nader for contributing to their losses in 2016 and 2000.
But they say third parties will be especially impactful in 2024 because of the nature of Trump’s support base.
“Trump needs to split the anti-Trump coalition. If we’re united, we win. If we’re not, he wins,” Dennis said. “We see [Kennedy and No Labels] essentially as an arm of the Trump campaign and we intend to treat it as such.”
Democrats have been quick to point out that the biggest donor to Kennedy's super PAC is also one of Trump's largest donors, an heir to the conservative Mellon family.
As they see it, Trump has a ceiling of support of around 46%, so to beat him, they need to compel the remaining majority of voters to back Biden. Trump can win without a majority of the vote, they argue, if third parties splinter what they see as the anti-Trump majority.
“The single biggest threat that helps put Trump back in the White House is third-party candidates. It’s not Biden’s age. It’s not whether Trump gets convicted. It’s not any of that stuff,” said Joe Trippi, a veteran Democratic strategist who co-founded a new super PAC that is preparing to run TV ads in battleground states.
The group, Citizens to Save Our Republic, is backed by a long and somewhat bipartisan list of bold-faced Washington names, including two former defense secretaries, five former senators, 14 current and former members of Congress, three former presidential candidates and several well-known Democratic and anti-Trump Republican operatives.
“It’s not like Trump doesn’t lose a vote or two, but the erosion occurs much more out of Biden than Trump,"" Trippi said. “The Trump people know he needs strong third parties.""
Indeed, Trump's campaign and his allies largely agree with that analysis, at least publicly, and some encouraged Kennedy to enter the race.
Trump expanded his vote share from 2016 to 2020, from 46.1% to 46.9%, but won in 2016 and lost in 2020 because of third parties, Trippi argued. In 2016, third-party candidates collectively received almost 5% of the national popular vote, while they earned only about 1.5% of the vote in 2020.
Citizens to Save Our Republic has already run TV ads warning “all third parties and spoilers,"" is preparing for a much bigger ad campaign in key states, and has begun an insider push to pressure No Labels to commit to standing down if it becomes clear it can't win.
""The Biden campaign is going to have to spend a boatload of money educating people about the danger of a third-party vote,” former Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill said. ""Biden will have to spend money explaining there’s no vote for anyone else that’s not a vote for Trump.”
The anti-third party coalition, whose hub is the centrist Democratic think tank Third Way, has mostly focused on No Labels, given its  superior fundraising and organization.
Behind the scenes, insiders in both parties have been pressuring potential candidates not to join the No Labels tickets, warning they would lose and be pariahs in their party, which has contributed to No Labels' struggles to find a credible top of its ticket.
“The growing list of top-tier prospects who have said no is important progress, but we’re going to keep at it until we know if they secured a name for their ticket. They only need one,” Kate deGruyter of Third Way said.
Third Way and the DNC have each separately retained lawyers to file legal challenges against Kennedy and his super PAC for alleged illegal coordination on ballot access. The super PAC said Monday that it would stop gathering signatures on Kennedy’s behalf.
End Citizens United, a campaign finance reform group, has pressured No Labels to disclose its donors and filed its own legal complaints with the IRS and 27 states arguing that No Labels is violating its nonprofit tax status by essentially acting as a political party.
More legal challenges are almost guaranteed, with attorneys actively monitoring third-party ballot access attempts across the country to look for any slip-up that could be exploited.
And with dissatisfaction on Biden’s left, MoveOn is looking to deter young and progressive voters from voting for third-party candidates, recently launching a six-figure ad buy warning that “voting for No Labels or any third party presidential candidate helps Trump win.”
Meanwhile, Rick Wilson, the ex-Republican strategist who co-founded the anti-Trump group the Lincoln Project, said that he and his colleagues are worried that third-party candidates will be an appealing option for anti-Trump Republicans and soft Democrats who don’t want to vote for either Trump or Biden.
“These are people that are not going to go from Biden to Trump, but they might go from Biden to a third party,” he said.
Wilson said that he likes the idea of a multiparty democracy in theory, and would not be bothered by No Labels’ presidential ambitions in a more traditional election, but that the stakes are too high this year — even if it means depriving voters of options and making them choose between two candidates they might not be excited about.
“I’m not forcing anybody to do anything, I’m just living in a reality where if it’s a three-party problem, a three-body-problem, Donald Trump is going to win,” he said.

2024-03-09T16:54:11.739Z,Biden signs major government funding bill just in time to prevent a shutdown,NBC News,"WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden on Saturday signed a major government funding bill into law, defusing fears of a partial shutdown.
A White House statement announcing that Biden had signed the bill thanked Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Speaker Mike Johnson and other lawmakers for their leadership on the issue.
The Senate voted 75-22 on Friday to pass the funding bill to keep a slew of agencies afloat through September. The 1,050-page measure is a collection of six appropriations bills negotiated by Schumer, Johnson, Biden and top appropriators in both parties and chambers. It funds the departments of Justice, Commerce, Agriculture, Transportation and many other parts of the government, after leaders split federal funding into two packages.
It passed the House on Wednesday by a vote of 339-85.
The Democratic-led Senate approved the legislation after some delays caused by Republican demands for amendments, which leaders in the chamber resolved by granting votes on multiple GOP-pushed measures before passing the main bill.
“After months of hard work, we have good news for the country: Tonight the Senate has reached an agreement avoiding a shutdown on the first six funding bills,” Schumer said before the vote. “We will keep important programs funded for moms and kids, for veterans, for the environment, for housing, and so much more.”
“I want to thank our appropriators. You’ve done such a fine job,” he said.
Senate leaders faced a tricky balance with GOP demands for amendments on immigration and other items. If an amendment came up and passed, it would have sent the bill back to the House, all but guaranteeing a shutdown. Instead, they struck a deal on vote timing designed to keep the bill intact.
Tougher work still lies ahead. The remaining six appropriations bills, which include contentious issues like how to fund the Pentagon and the Department of Homeland Security, face a deadline in just two weeks, on March 22. Negotiators haven’t reached a deal on how to resolve that yet, much less written legislation to do so.
Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., the top Democratic appropriator in the House, said the remaining six bills are “in various stages of negotiations” as “staff on both sides of the aisle, in both chambers, are working on them.”
“We worked hard to get these done,” DeLauro said. “I’m optimistic about getting the next six done.”
Johnson, for his part, said the bill passed Friday contains conservative wins including cuts to the FBI, Environmental Protection Agency and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. He said Republicans achieved that “with divided government and a historically small House majority.”
Democrats have highlighted the package’s funding for WIC, a program that provides food assistance for women, infants and children, among other wins.

2024-03-06T18:48:40.688Z,Man charged with trying to scam former Rep. George Santos and celebrities,NBC News,"Federal prosecutors have charged a Texas man who they say tried to scam former Rep. George Santos, as well as an actor, a musician and a professional athlete, by falsely suggesting he could help get criminal charges dropped.
Hector Medina Jr., was arrested in his hometown, El Paso, Texas, on Wednesday and faces charges in the Eastern District of New York.
An FBI affidavit says the bureau had been investigating a person who identified himself as “Michael Soto,” whom it identified as Medina. The bureau says he targeted individuals “who were, or whose family members were, facing criminal exposure"" by falsely promising his targets that he ""could cause their criminal exposure to disappear in exchange for large sums of money.”
The FBI said that Medina admitted in an interview with law enforcement in December that he ""searched the Internet for individuals who were in trouble believing that they would be easy targets for his scheme"" and that he was trying to get money because he ""owed over $100,000 in gambling debts.""
While Santos, R-N.Y., is not explicitly named as a victim in the complaint, details in the affidavit make it clear that Santos is ""Individual-1,"" one of four victims listed. Santos was expelled from the House in December and faces charges brought in May, to which he has pleaded not guilty. He was hit with additional charges in October, with prosecutors alleging he engaged in identity theft.
An attorney for Santos did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Individual 2 is identified in the affidavit as ""a publicly known actor who had been convicted of felonies in California in May 2023."" Individual 3 is listed as a ""publicly known musician who had been arrested in June 2023."" Individual 4 is listed as ""a professional athlete"" whose ""family member had been arrested in May 2023.""

2024-03-13T10:00:41.000Z,Georgia Democrats brace for a 'tough fight ahead' in keeping the state blue in 2024,NBC News,"ATLANTA — Georgia was the site of Democrats’ biggest breakthrough in the 2020 election, with Joe Biden becoming the party’s first presidential nominee to win the state in 28 years.
But four years later, some of the organizers who helped orchestrate the history-making victory acknowledge Democrats face an uphill climb to keep the state blue as they prepare for a rematch with Donald Trump.
“This is certainly not going to be a walk in the park,” said LaTosha Brown, a co-founder of the voting rights group Black Voters Matter. “I think that we certainly have a tough fight ahead of us.”
Brown is among the activists credited with helping turn out Black and younger voters, who helped carry Biden to victory in the state in 2020.
But she said the mood is much different among those voters this time around, as a sense of fatigue with the political process has set in.
“You get to the tipping point where people really want to see change, and I think the rate of change for things they want to see is not happening as fast as they want to see it,” Brown said.
“It’s sobering to deal with the reality of how slowly change actually happens,” she added.
In 2020, Biden won Georgia by just 11,779 votes, becoming the first Democratic presidential nominee to carry the state since Bill Clinton in 1992.
Two months after Biden’s victory, Georgia voters sent two more Democrats — Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff — to the U.S. Senate in runoff elections, flipping the state’s two seats and control of the Senate from the GOP.
At the time, Georgia was heralded as an example to other local Democratic parties of how to organize and turn out voters in traditionally red states.
But four years later, early polls suggest Biden has lost significant ground in Georgia. A survey from The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in January showed him trailing Trump by 8 percentage points among registered voters in the state.
The poll also found that Biden’s approval rating was well underwater, including among independents. And 10% of Black voters said they didn't plan to vote in the presidential election.
A CBS News/YouGov poll released this week showed a slightly tighter race, with Trump leading Biden by 3 points among likely voters, within the margin of error.
Ahead of Georgia’s presidential primary election this week, Biden and Trump held competing rallies in the state, underscoring its importance for each campaign’s path to victory.
Georgia is also guaranteed to be in the spotlight for another reason: It is home to one of four criminal cases against Trump, who faces charges in Fulton County alleging he tried to overturn the results of the state’s 2020 presidential election.
And while Democrats acknowledge that the case could prove beneficial in their efforts to turn out voters in Georgia, some strategists point to several missed opportunities for the party to drum up enthusiasm. They include passing over Atlanta as the location for this summer’s Democratic National Convention, opting instead for Chicago.
But Kendra Cotton, CEO of the New Georgia Project Action Fund, an affiliate of the group founded by former gubernatorial candidate and voting rights advocate Stacey Abrams, said enthusiasm isn’t the best marker to measure turnout.
“Who cares whether folks are enthusiastic? What you care about is whether or not they’re going to actually get out to vote,” Cotton said. “Because what I can tell you is in the Southern region, rare are the elections where people are super enthusiastic about candidates, but we vote nonetheless.”
Both she and Brown said their approach will be to focus less on the candidate and more on empowering people to know their votes can change their circumstances. Cotton said it has been challenging to inform voters about the Biden administration’s accomplishments, and she urged Biden’s surrogates to tell more personal stories of people who have benefited from his policies.
“We know it’s going to take many more touches, door knocks, to talk to people to ensure that while they may not be as excited about voting for either candidate, they will be resolved, nonetheless, to show up and cast the ballot,” Cotton said.
Republicans say the lack of excitement for Biden has provided them with an opening to reclaim the state in November.
Martha Zoller, a longtime Georgia Republican strategist, points to Georgia’s 2022 midterms as evidence that that goal is well within reach. Republicans won every nearly statewide race that year, with the notable exception of Trump-endorsed Senate candidate Herschel Walker.
Zoller, who cast an early primary ballot for Nikki Haley, who has dropped out of the presidential race, said the message Trump decides to tour with will be key in winning back the Republican voters who have soured on him — especially those in suburban Atlanta counties like Gwinnett and Cobb, which proved crucial to Biden’s victory.
“You’ve got to get back the people like me that you lost: a suburban woman who voted for Trump twice, gave money to him, but after Jan. 6 just really didn’t want any part of it anymore,” she said.
“The key really is going to be can he be positive enough? It’s tone. It’s looking forward and not backward,” she added. “There are good surrogates throughout the state that can take the message out. And if they can do that, then it’s going to be different, because it’s just 12,000 votes. That is an easy number to overcome, especially if this time the Democrats aren’t as excited about voting for Joe Biden.”
Democrats acknowledge Biden won Georgia under a unique set of circumstances in 2020, between the pandemic and the social unrest fueled by the deaths of Ahmaud Arbery and George Floyd.
But Fred Hicks, a political consultant in Georgia, said the party would ultimately unite around one cause: beating Trump.
“Donald Trump is the best tool that Democrats have in our arsenal to win 2024,” Hicks said. “As long as Donald Trump is on the ballot in Georgia, Democrats have a chance.”

Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., will bring with him the nation’s first IVF baby, Elizabeth Carr, who was born in 1981. “I was aware of her story after the Alabama decision,” Kaine told NBC News on Wednesday. “I saw an interview first where she said, ‘I feel like an endangered species.’ And that made me say let’s reach out and see if she’ll come to the State of Union. And I’m very, very glad she is.”
Follow live updates on the State of the Union address
House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., has invited Jodi Hicks, the CEO of Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California, as his guest. Rep. Katherine Clark of Massachusetts, the Democratic whip, is bringing a Texas woman, Amanda Zurawski, who was denied urgently needed abortion care in Texas. Rep. Judy Chu of California will be joined by Dr. Caitlin Bernard, an OB-GYN who came under fire for speaking out about providing an abortion to a 10-year-old girl who had been raped.
And a trio of Senate Democratic women, Tina Smith of Minnesota, Tammy Duckworth of Illinois and President Pro Tempore Patty Murray of Washington, also invited women directly affected by the landscape of patchwork reproductive laws across the country.
Duckworth, who had both of her children via IVF, is bringing Dr. Amanda Adeleye, an OB-GYN, with her to the address. She and other Democrats chose their guests, she said, “because they’re on the front lines. They’re living in these challenges, and I think the most powerful testimony is the real-life testimony of women and providers all across this country.”
Asked what she hopes to hear from President Joe Biden, Tammi Kromenaker, a Minnesota-based women’s clinic director who is attending as Tina Smith’s guest, replied: “I want to hear the word ‘abortion.’ It’s not a dirty word. And I want to hear it said loud and proud.”
In an interview, Kromenaker shared the harsh reality of operating a clinic that provides abortions in a state surrounded by others that restrict the procedure. “Every week, our patients have to drive into our parking lot with protesters standing right there yelling and screaming at them,” she said. “We have a protester who stands on a ladder at the fence of the property next door and yells at them over the fence. It’s constant. It’s every week. It’s relentless.”
Kayla Smith, a guest of Murray’s, was pregnant with her second child in 2022 when, at 19 weeks, she learned that her baby had serious and fatal fetal anomalies. Because of Idaho’s restrictive abortion laws, Smith said, she was forced to take out a $16,000 loan and relocate her family from Idaho to Washington state to obtain care.
“The whole situation was a traumatic situation. Again, we were trying to have a baby and it kind of felt like we got struck by lightning,” Smith shared in a room flanked by the other women.
Smith said her physician had since moved out of Idaho, too, fearing that she would be criminally prosecuted for providing care to women. Idaho bans abortions in nearly all cases, and providing the procedure is a felony punishable by imprisonment.
“So, OK, pro-life, well, what about my life, too?” Smith said, holding back tears. “Because I also had severe preeclampsia with my [first-born] daughter, like with severity. I was admitted to the hospital. I had her at 33 weeks, so I was also at risk for that.”
Adeleye, who is based in Illinois and focuses on IVF and using research to close the gap on fertility-related disparities, said Alabama’s IVF ruling “is really frustrating, it’s disappointing, but it’s not surprising.”
“I’m fortunate to be at a point now where I’m trying to help people build families, but it doesn’t always lead to, you know, a bundle of joy nine months later. There’s so many ups and downs,” Adeleye said in an interview in the Capitol on Thursday. “And so what really bothered me was even after Dobbs, I had patients in my office crying, asking me about what’s going to happen to my embryos? And I just said I’m not a lawyer, I don’t know. I can’t predict the future.”
“And that is just something I never expected to have to say or think about,” she added. “Or to address fear in my patients. … Sadness, loss, excitement, all those things are expected. Fear? I wasn’t expecting that.”
At a news conference Thursday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., flanked by the trio of senators and their guests and by advocates from Planned Parenthood, promised to “preserve the right to IVF” despite a failed effort by Duckworth to codify that right last week; it was blocked by Republicans on the Senate floor.
He highlighted the story of Kate Farley, a New York woman who is pregnant via IVF and will join him as one of his guests at the presidential address. “How dare these right-wing ideologues say that she shouldn’t be able to have children or millions of other mothers who have beautiful children through the miracle of IVF, through the advances of medical science?” Schumer said.
Adeleye stressed that she hopes Biden will champion “education and science and medicine.”
“Quite frankly, this whole Alabama nonsense wouldn’t have happened if people on the ground understood medical science in a way that was clear and accurate,” she said.

2024-03-13T21:00:40.849Z,The TikTok bill may be just the start of efforts to crack down on social media: From the Politics Desk,NBC News,"Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team’s latest reporting and analysis from the campaign trail, the White House and Capitol Hill.
In today’s edition, assistant managing editor of tech and science Jason Abbruzzese explains how the TikTok vote in the House Wednesday is part of a broader effort to crack down on social media companies after years of inaction. Plus, chief political analyst Chuck Todd takes a look at the GOP divide in Ohio's Senate race ahead of next week's primary.
It’s not just TikTok.
Yes, Wednesday’s vote — and the vitriol surrounding it that surprisingly does not fall cleanly along party lines — was primarily about TikTok, as the House overwhelmingly approved legislation that could ban the popular app if the China-based ByteDance doesn’t divest it.
But it’s also a move that adds to the broader momentum around legislation aimed at cracking down on social media companies. For years, plenty of politicians had talked tough and floated the occasional bill targeting consumer tech giants. Tech companies like Facebook (now Meta) even mounted campaigns calling for regulation, albeit the kind that they helped shape. Little changed.
Do you have a news tip? Let us know
That’s started to shift, and there’s plenty of bills that aren’t expressly about TikTok. The most notable, the Kids Online Safety Act, has also gained momentum on Capitol Hill and resulted in a similar scrambling of traditional political coalitions. That bill would require social media companies to do more to make their platforms safe for younger users around issues like sexual exploitation and harassment.
At the state level, governments are entertaining a variety of different legislative ideas, even going so far as to propose bans on social media for kids under 16.
That said, there’s plenty of barriers left for these bills. Passing through both chambers of Congress or a state legislature remains a major hurdle, not to mention the inevitable legal challenges that have scuttled even successful legislation. Laws passed by Texas and Florida meant to impose restrictions on how social media companies moderate their platforms were met with skepticism by Supreme Court justices during recent arguments, suggesting the laws could soon be struck down.
Even after earning broad support in the House, the TikTok legislation now faces an uncertain future in the Senate, where members are expressing less urgency to act. Democrats will have to weigh sending such a bill to President Joe Biden, whose struggles with young voters have been well documented, as his re-election campaign ramps up. Biden has said he would sign the bill if it reaches his desk.
But even the TikTok bill’s ultimate failure would add to what is a varied and increasingly bipartisan move on social media companies that once operated with few concerns of government intervention.
While Donald Trump has decisively won the GOP nomination for president, in some places, there’s still a battle down the ballot over what direction the party should take — often breaking down along similar lines to Trump’s one-on-one phase of his primary with Nikki Haley.
The Republican electorate spoke out loud and clear for the side of Trump in the presidential primaries, but some of the sub-battles in this struggle between the two wings are closer contests. Ohio’s Senate primary might be ground zero for this debate, as Trump and his forces are fully behind Bernie Moreno, while the more Chamber of Commerce-aligned wing of the party is behind a wealthy scion, state Sen. Matt Dolan.
The divides in this race are stark, particularly over issues like Ukraine and whether the government should be small or strong. In the last Ohio Senate primary, the old guard stayed out of the race and let Trump essentially pick the nominee, now-Sen. JD Vance.
This time, the old guard is uniting behind a non-Trump candidate, with Gov. Mike DeWine and former Sen. Rob Portman supporting Dolan. Dolan ran against Vance in 2022 but didn’t have this level of outside support.
For those Republicans who hope to rebuild and redirect the party in a new direction post-Trump, a Dolan primary victory would be the start of a movement in that direction — should Trump lose the presidential race. But a Moreno victory would mean the Ohio GOP is most likely headed into the arms of Trump for the long haul, not just an election cycle or two.
Whatever the outcome in this Senate primary, it will matter a lot to the future of the GOP. And it’s certainly, for me, the most consequential Republican race to watch this cycle because of all the subtext involved.

Kennedy said in an interview last month that he would most likely name his VP pick within the next 30 days. The self-imposed deadline passed in early March with no announcement, and he said Wednesday in a post on X that he would announce his VP pick on March 26.
""He’s considering Aaron Rodgers and Jesse Ventura as running mates along with others on a shortlist,"" a spokesperson for the Kennedy campaign said Tuesday. ""No other details available.""
A source familiar with Kennedy's pending vice presidential candidate pick told NBC News on Wednesday that he has offered the VP slot to an individual and that the individual has accepted the offer.
The New York Times first reported that Rodgers and Ventura, a former professional wrestler, were on Kennedy's shortlist.
Rodgers and the Jets did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Ventura could not be reached for comment.
Ventura, 72, was elected governor of Minnesota in 1998, becoming the first Reform Party candidate to win statewide office. He served one term and did not seek re-election.
Rodgers, 40, a future Hall of Fame quarterback who has won a Super Bowl title and four MVP awards, is expected to return to the field this year after an injury in the first game of the 2023 season kept him on the sidelines.
Rodgers endorsed Kennedy, 70, last year after the two bonded over their opposition to Covid vaccines. On Tuesday afternoon, Rodgers reposted Kennedy’s response to President Joe Biden's State of the Union address on X, saying, “This is presidential.”
The Democratic National Committee bashed Kennedy's shortlist.
“The Three Stooges reunion no one was asking for. It’s no surprise this is the shortlist considering the conspiracy theorist doing the choosing,” Democratic National Committee senior adviser Mary Beth Cahill said in a statement.
Kennedy ended his presidential campaign as a Democrat last year and launched an independent bid after having struggled to build support from the Democratic base.
According to a Quinnipiac University poll released last month that examined a hypothetical race that included Biden, former President Donald Trump and Kennedy as an independent candidate, 38% of voters said they would support Biden, followed by 37% for Trump and 15% for Kennedy.
The poll, which included 1,421 self-identified registered voters nationwide, had a margin of error of plus or minus 2.6 percentage points.

2024-03-06T16:12:22.928Z,Doritos severs ties with transgender influencer in Spain following online boycott threat,NBC News,"Doritos said Tuesday that it has ended a social media campaign with Samantha Hudson, a transgender influencer in Spain. Right-leaning accounts on social media had called for a boycott, citing past comments Hudson was alleged to have made on social media.
Hudson, 24, a singer with 396,000 followers on Instagram, had posted a 50-second branded video on Instagram for a Doritos Spain campaign called “Crunch Talks.” It’s unclear when the video went up; as of Monday afternoon it had been removed from Hudson’s page. No other posts on her Instagram account feature promotion of the brand.
Efforts to boycott Doritos online ramped up Monday and Tuesday, when the hashtag #BoycottDoritos circulated on X. Many right-wing accounts, which re-shared the original Doritos promotional video, homed in on posts Hudson is alleged to have made on the platform when she was 15, which they described as offensive.
Hudson was reported to have tweeted in 2015 about wanting to do “depraved” things with a 12-year-old girl, according to Rolling Stone. NBC News has not seen the original posts on social media, and they appear to have been removed from X. Screenshots of the alleged posts resurfaced on X, where they were recirculated.
Hudson reportedly later expressed remorse for the past tweets, according to Rolling Stone’s translation of her past posts on X. However, it appears the post addressing her past comments, which was made in 2021, is no longer available on her page.
Others online pointed out that Hudson has been critical of the right wing in Spain. In an interview clip that resurfaced, she appears to say she advocates “for the abolition to destroy and eliminate the traditional monogamous nuclear family,” according to a translation of the video from Spanish to English.
Doritos, a PepsiCo brand, said Tuesday in a statement to NBC News that it ended its campaign with Hudson after it was made aware of the past tweets.
“We [Doritos Spain] recently created a content series with Samantha Hudson, a local influencer. After the campaign started, we were made aware of Samantha’s deleted Tweets from around 2015,” it said. “We have ended the relationship and stopped all related campaign activity due to the comments. We strongly condemn words or actions that promote violence or sexism of any kind.”
Hudson did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday. She has also not publicly weighed in on the Doritos fallout on social media.
Anheuser-Busch last year attracted controversy with its partnership with the transgender TikTok influencer Dylan Mulvaney, who rocketed to fame in 2022 by documenting her gender transition in a TikTok series she calls “Days of Girlhood."" Mulvaney was also among a small group of young advocates who met in 2022 with President Joe Biden at the White House, where she talked about transgender issues.
Following Mulvaney's video, conservatives, including celebrities like Kid Rock, began posting viral videos of themselves trashing Bud Light cans, pouring them down the sink and even shooting them. Sales of the brand plummeted.
U.S. CEO Brendan Whitworth said at the time that the company “never intended to be part of a discussion that divides people.” Mulvaney later said the company did not support her through the backlash.
Far-right accounts on X, including Libs of TikTok and End Wokeness, expressed disgust at Hudson’s Doritos video. Some referred to the Bud Light boycott.
“Time to Bud Light Doritos,” Libs of TikTok wrote in a post re-sharing the video. “Unreal.”
A headline on The Daily Caller, a conservative news outlet, said: “Doritos Terrifying New Brand Ambassador Makes Dylan Mulvaney Look Like Sydney Sweeney.”

2024-03-04T21:33:48.355Z,United Airlines expects busiest spring break ever despite travelers' cost concerns,NBC News,"United Airlines expects its busiest spring break ever this year, even as travelers say they are concerned about rising costs.
The carrier said Monday it expects to serve more than 21 million passengers from March 8 to April 21 — up nearly 10% compared with last year.
That equates to more than 200,000 people per day on average during the period — about 15,000 more people flying per day than last year.
United said it expects the busiest travel day to be Friday, March 22, when more than 500,000 passengers are scheduled to travel via the carrier. Likewise, the week of March 25 will be the busiest travel week, with about 480,000 people flying each day that week, on average.
The travel group Expedia separately reported last month that the April 8 solar eclipse appears to be driving some of the biggest surges in bookings, with locations in Texas — the state with one of the largest exposures to the event — nearly doubling; searches for Dallas are up 95% year over year, Expedia said, while Austin searches are up 90%.
United and Expedia both said traditional spring getaway locations like Florida; Cancún, Mexico; and Las Vegas remain at the top of this year's most-sought-after destinations list.
According to the travel booking group Hopper, 90% of survey respondents traveling this spring said price and affordability are top of mind.
Yet despite higher demand, prices are actually down this year, according to Hayley Berg, the lead economist with Hopper. A ""good deal"" average price for someone who plans ahead for a spring break trip in the U.S. is down 2% from last year and 11% from 2019 to about $250, Hopper data shows.
In fact, the lower prices are helping drive demand, Berg said. Thanks to increased competition from low-cost carriers, increased seating capacity on planes and a return to full-strength staffing, the price the average consumer is likely to encounter when booking continues to fall — a trend that had been occurring before the onset of Covid-19 in 2020.
""It's been great for consumers,"" she said. ""Pre-pandemic, prices were down consistently for years. It's something that's allowed the millennial generation to have travel be something they do a lot of.""

2024-02-13T18:11:14.439Z,Tiger Woods unveils new lifestyle brand and clothing line after Nike split,NBC News,"Tiger Woods has unveiled his new lifestyle brand and clothing line, called Sun Day Red, in the wake of his high-profile split with longtime sponsor Nike.
At a news conference Monday evening in Los Angeles, Woods said the new offering, in collaboration with TaylorMade Golf, marks a new milestone in his career.
“It’s the right time in my life,” said Woods, 48. “It’s transitional. I’m no longer a kid anymore.”
The motif for Sun Day Red — a reference to Woods' penchant for wearing red on the final day of weekend match play — will incorporate Woods’ 15 major championships into the logo of a tiger stretched. (Woods said he would update the logo if he were to win another a major.)
Woods and Nike announced last month they were ending their 27-year partnership, leaving Nike's future in golf uncertain.
Woods, meanwhile, remains one of the sport's biggest draws and influencers as he continues to chase Jack Nicklaus' record 18 majors and six Masters wins. Nicklaus won his final major and last Green Jacket at age 46; Woods most recently won a major at the 2019 Masters.
Experts say the Sun Day Red line should attract interest from consumers as long as Woods continues to make regular appearances. While a slew of injuries have reduced the number of tournaments Woods now competes in, he is set to tee off in this week’s Genesis Invitational Tournament in Los Angeles.
“Michael Jordan is still Michael Jordan, and Air Jordans still do very well,” said Eric Smallwood, president of Apex Marketing Group, invoking the basketball Hall of Famer for comparison.
Woods’ deal with Nike was worth an estimated $660 million over its three-decade lifespan.
Privately held TaylorMade's other current or former No. 1 golf endorsers include Rory McIlroy, Dustin Johnson and Scottie Scheffler.
Sun Day Red products will officially hit stores May 1.

2024-02-26T17:51:42.097Z,Biden administration sues to block Kroger-Albertsons supermarket merger,NBC News,"The Biden administration is suing to block a proposed merger between Kroger and Albertsons supermarket chains, saying the deal would lead to higher food prices for consumers.
The Federal Trade Commission announced the suit in a release Monday on its website.
""The FTC charges that the proposed deal will eliminate fierce competition between Kroger and Albertsons, leading to higher prices for groceries and other essential household items for millions of Americans,"" it said. ""The loss of competition will also lead to lower quality products and services, while also narrowing consumers’ choices for where to shop for groceries.""
Americans have seen food-at-home prices climb more than 20% since the beginning of the pandemic, though more recently those cost pressures have eased. The USDA reported that U.S. consumers spent an average of 11.3% of their disposable personal income on food in 2022 — reaching levels similar to the 1980s, though much of this increase was attributable to large gains in food consumed away from home.
Kroger, the second-largest grocer in the nation behind Walmart; and Albertson's, the fourth-largest behind Costco, first announced the proposed $25 billion deal in December 2022. It was premised on the chains operating in different parts of the country. If successful, the tie-up would lead to a company with 710,000 workers operating nearly 5,000 stores and approximately 4,000 pharmacies.
But the FTC said in its suit the the merger could also make wages for workers less competitive by eliminating competition.
“This supermarket mega merger comes as American consumers have seen the cost of groceries rise steadily over the past few years. Kroger’s acquisition of Albertsons would lead to additional grocery price hikes for everyday goods, further exacerbating the financial strain consumers across the country face today,” said Henry Liu, Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Competition, in the release. “Essential grocery store workers would also suffer under this deal, facing the threat of their wages dwindling, benefits diminishing, and their working conditions deteriorating.”
In a statement, Kroger criticized the Biden administration's suit.
""Contrary to the FTC’s statements, blocking Kroger’s merger with Albertsons Companies will actually harm the very people the FTC purports to serve: America’s consumers and workers,"" the company said.
An Albertsons spokesperson issued a similar statement, saying the proposed merger would ""expand competition, lower prices, increase associate wages, protect union jobs, and enhance customers shopping experience.""
""If the Federal Trade Commission is successful in blocking this merger, it would be hurting customers and helping strengthen larger, multi-channel retailers such as Amazon, Walmart and Costco — the very companies the FTC claims to be reining in — by allowing them to continue increasing their growing dominance of the grocery industry.""

2024-02-11T12:00:40.000Z,Super Bowl fans are flooding Vegas with cash. Don’t bet on a big windfall for workers.,NBC News,"Big spenders are set to boost Las Vegas service workers’ earnings during Super Bowl weekend, but maybe not by much.
Sin City expects to host more than 330,000 visitors as the San Francisco 49ers face off against the Kansas City Chiefs in the NFL’s title game on Sunday.
The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority expects the matchup to generate $600 million in economic impact for the city, though the U.S. Chamber of Commerce says the broader payoff can take time to be fully realized, estimating Arizona’s statewide haul at $1.3 billion after Phoenix hosted last year.
Follow along for live coverage of Super Bowl 58
Much of that will come from attendance at Allegiant Stadium itself, where the least expensive seat was going for $5,700 on StubHub by Friday morning and the priciest neared $19,000. After fans splurged for a place in the stands, some stadium workers fear even the most well-heeled among them may not have much to spare for their tip jars — especially at a time of widespread “tipflation” fatigue.
“Honestly, because of the price of the seats, I’m hoping they’ll have enough to even give us tips,” stadium employee Michael Santa Cruz said with a laugh.
The 63-year-old refreshment stand worker was taking a few days to rest up before clocking in 6:30 a.m. Sunday for the big game, where he’ll work until 9 at night.
“We’re assuming the people that come there have money,” he said, but “we’ve had people by the same token that come in and say, ‘Wow, $18 for a beer!?’ and they’ll walk away and they won’t tip us.”
“It’s understandable,” added Santa Cruz, who has worked at the stadium — the home of the Las Vegas Raiders — since July 2020 earning $13 an hour.
Beyond the arena, visitors will be shelling out on everything from souvenirs to a small galaxy of game-related festivities, such as a “Super Bowl Experience” at the Mandalay Bay Convention Center ($50 tickets) and “Shaq’s Fun House,” a Shaquille O’Neal-fronted poolside nightclub with carnival games and music (tickets start at $149.99). Fans heading to Vegas expressly for the Super Bowl are forecast to drop about $215 million on food, drinks, hotels and football swag alone, the Chamber estimates.
Because of the price of the seats, I’m hoping they’ll have enough to even give us tips.
Michael Santa Cruz, ALLEGIANT STADIUM WORKER
Many will be paying top dollar, which could help juice earnings for the more than 300,000 hospitality workers in Las Vegas, industry experts said.
“Historically, we see that when room rates are high in the city, it attracts consumers with higher disposable incomes, which translates into higher tips,” said Amanda Belarmino, an assistant professor of hospitality at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.
Average daily rates for Vegas hotels hit $570 for the Friday before the game (the most expensive night), more than twice the $220 average when the city hosted the Formula 1 Grand Prix last fall, according to Hotels.com.
But because most local hospitality workers are union members whose pay is dictated by contracts, “it does not necessarily translate to higher salaries for line-level workers,” Belarmino said, though “it will enable some part-time union workers to get more hours.”
The Culinary Workers Union Local 226, which represents over 60,000 Las Vegas hospitality employees — from bartenders and guest room attendants to laundry and kitchen staff at resort casinos on and off the Strip — reached tentative contract agreements with major operators days ahead of the Super Bowl. The deals are expected to push the average member’s earnings up from around $28 an hour, including their benefits, to $37 an hour including benefits over five years, said union spokeswoman Bethany Khan.
The Formula 1 race in November was a warmup. No one knows what to expect from the Super Bowl.
Richard Samuels, General Manager of Omni Limousine
Santa Cruz, who works for a food and beverage contractor at the stadium and is involved in efforts to join the culinary union, said he’s hoping to “break at least $350” in tips on Sunday but added, “That’s not a guarantee.” He said he typically pulls in around $200 in gratuities during NFL games.
Allegiant Stadium was early to embrace the digital card readers that have become a growing source of tips for many retail and service workers. But as those systems proliferate, consumers are getting sick of their ubiquitous tipping prompts — and often have no trouble ignoring them, NBC News has reported.
For workers at restaurants that use Square’s payment system, the growth of tips as a share of take-home pay is slower in Sin City than elsewhere, the company said. It rose there just 3 percentage points since 2020 to hit 20%, versus a 5-percentage-point gain topping out at 21% nationwide.
Vegas restaurant workers’ overall compensation also lags the national average, according to Square. Their median base pay of $13 is about $1 shy of the U.S. rate, and the gap widens to $1.50 after tips and overtime, which clock in around $16.17 in the metro area. However, Square said restaurant staffers’ earnings in the city are growing faster than they are nationally.
To help encourage nonunion tip-earners to work Super Bowl weekend, some Las Vegas employers are charging customers extra.
On top of surge pricing, Uber is adding a $10 surcharge for rides to the stadium on Sunday afternoon, rising to $25 in the evening, that it says will go straight to drivers. Lyft said it was “planning increased incentives for drivers the week of the game” but no additional fees for stadium trips.
Many employers in Vegas already require fixed-rate gratuities, potentially making the promise of tips during the Super Bowl no better or worse than on any other day.
Omni Limousine, which has a fleet of 90 vehicles, hasn’t raised rates for this weekend but was fully booked for the big game five months ago, “mostly by our regular corporate and celebrity customers,” said general manager Richard Samuels.
The company charges an automatic 20% chauffeur gratuity on all rides, and drivers can still accept additional cash tips, Samuels said.
“The Formula 1 race in November was a warmup,” he said. “No one knows what to expect from the Super Bowl.”

2024-03-05T20:07:57.589Z,Business groups hit back at Biden administration's effort to cap credit card late fees,NBC News,"The Biden administration is seeking to impose a new limit on the typical credit card late fee, but the consumer credit and banking industry warns the change could ultimately affect other consumers in the form of higher interest rates.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said in a release Tuesday that a proposed $8 cap for a typical late fee would help save consumers a cumulative $10 billion.
“For over a decade, credit card giants have been exploiting a loophole to harvest billions of dollars in junk fees from American consumers,” CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said. “Today’s rule ends the era of big credit card companies hiding behind the excuse of inflation when they hike fees on borrowers and boost their own bottom lines.
President Joe Biden has made targeting ""junk"" fees a major focus of his administration. Earlier Tuesday, he announced the formation of a task force targeting unfair and illegal pricing schemes.
But the credit card industry and other financial associations are already hitting out at the CFPB's proposed new rule, saying it could lead to unintended consequences for consumers.
In a statement, Rob Nichols, the president and CEO of the American Bankers Association, called the proposal ""flawed,"" arguing it could actually result in more late payments and ultimately lower credit scores. It could also have a knock-on effect for card users who do pay what they owe on time, Nichols said.
""The Bureau’s misguided decision to cap credit card late fees at a level far below banks’ actual costs will force card issuers to reduce credit lines, tighten standards for new accounts and raise APRs for all consumers — even those who pay on time,"" Nichols said.
The Consumer Bankers Association, another trade group, echoed those concerns.
“The rule’s policy goals are, at best, consumer redistribution, not consumer protection,” the organization's president and chief executive, Lindsey Johnson, said in a statement.
Later Tuesday afternoon, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce announced it was suing over the proposal.
“Once again, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has exceeded its authority,"" the business group said in a statement. ""The agency’s final credit card late fee rule punishes Americans who pay their credit card bills on time by forcing them to pay for those who don’t. This will result in fewer card offerings and limit access to affordable credit for many consumers.""
The proposed rule would apply only to large credit card companies. Currently, credit card companies can charge as much as $30 for a first late payment under a law enacted in the wake of the 2008-09 financial crisis.
The CFPB said it had reviewed market data to arrive at the $8 late fee it is proposing. As part of the new rule, the CFPB would nevertheless allow banks to charge higher late fees under a ""show your work"" provision.
Nichols of the bankers' association said that the $8 level is ""far below"" banks’ actual cost of managing late fees and that the association is likely to challenge it.
""We will closely review this final rule and consider all options to fight the harmful consumer policy coming out of Director Chopra’s CFPB,"" Nichols said, adding: ""This rule should not be allowed to go into effect.”

2024-02-15T19:07:20.929Z,A rare high-performance Cadillac that once belonged to President Joe Biden is up for auction,NBC News,"A 2018 Cadillac ATS-V Sedan once leased by President Joe Biden has gone up for auction.
The car was built as a “one-of-one specification” for Biden while he was out of office after serving as vice president under President Barack Obama. Namely, the car features tinted windows and a Kona Brown interior that is not known to exist for any other factory-built ATS-V model.
In a statement, a Cadillac spokesperson confirmed Biden’s connection to the car, noting the original wheels had also been replaced. The car’s documentation shows they are 18-inch CT4-V Blackwing wheels finished in Tech Bronze.
“He clearly has great taste in cars,” the spokesperson said.
Biden has long played up his love of automobiles. He is perhaps most associated with a Goodwood Green 1967 Corvette Stingray that he received in his mid-20s as a wedding gift from his father, a longtime Chevy dealer. The four-speed, manual-transmission ‘Vette features a 327-cubic-inch L79 V8 engine rated at 350 horsepower.
Biden showed off the vehicle in an episode of “Jay Leno’s Garage” on CNBC.
Emails supporting the 2018 ATS-V’s documentation show Biden’s Secret Service detail requested that the car’s exterior come in black. Biden insisted on nothing else “extraordinary” about the car besides the Kona Brown leather interior. It’s not clear when the custom wheels were added.
The emails from 2017 also show Biden was considering reaching out directly to GM CEO Mary Barra or Johan de Nysschen, a onetime Cadillac executive, about the car.
Biden test-drove a CTS — a larger but more fuel-efficient version of the car — “for a few hours” before deciding on the ATS-V due to its smaller size, the emails from 2017 show.
The ATS-V up for auction has about 16,000 miles and had a high bid of nearly $30,000 among 13 bids as of Thursday afternoon, with six days of bidding remaining. Kelley Blue Book estimates an average 2018 ATS-V could fetch as much as $53,000 on the resale market.
The auction, though unrelated to Biden in the present day, is happening as the White House pushes for new standards to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The new rules also call on manufacturers to build and sell more electric vehicles, with the goal of having at least 50% of all new vehicle sales be electric by 2030.

2024-03-06T14:50:39.870Z,"Interest rates will likely start coming down this year — but not clear when, Powell says",NBC News,"Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday reiterated that he expects interest rates to start coming down this year, but is not ready yet to say when.
In prepared remarks for congressionally mandated appearances on Capitol Hill Wednesday and Thursday, Powell said policymakers remain attentive to the risks that inflation poses and don’t want to ease up too quickly.
“In considering any adjustments to the target range for the policy rate, we will carefully assess the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks,” he said. “The Committee does not expect that it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.”
Those remarks were taken verbatim from the Federal Open Market Committee’s statement following its most recent meeting, which concluded Jan. 31.
In total, the speech broke no new ground on monetary policy or the Fed’s economic outlook. However, the comments indicated that officials remain concerned about not losing the progress made against inflation and will make decisions based on incoming data rather than a preset course.
“We believe that our policy rate is likely at its peak for this tightening cycle. If the economy evolves broadly as expected, it will likely be appropriate to begin dialing back policy restraint at some point this year,” Powell said in the comments. “But the economic outlook is uncertain, and ongoing progress toward our 2 percent inflation objective is not assured.”
He noted again that lowering rates too quickly risks losing the battle against inflation and likely having to raise rates further, while waiting too long poses danger to economic growth.
Markets had been widely expecting the Fed to ease up aggressively following 11 interest rate hikes totaling 5.25 percentage points that spanned March 2022 to July 2023.
In recent weeks, though, those expectations have changed following multiple cautionary statements from Fed officials. The January meeting helped cement the Fed’s cautious approach, with the statement explicitly saying rate cuts aren’t coming yet despite the market’s outlook.
As things stand, futures market pricing points to the first cut coming in June, part of four reductions this year totaling a full percentage point. That’s slightly more aggressive than the Fed’s outlook in December for three cuts.
Despite the resistance to move forward on cuts, Powell noted the movement the Fed has made toward its goal of 2% inflation without tipping over the labor market and broader economy.
“The economy has made considerable progress toward these objectives over the past year,” Powell said. He noted that inflation has “eased substantially” as “the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals have been moving into better balance.”
Inflation as judged by the Fed’s preferred gauge is currently running at a 2.4% annual rate — 2.8% when stripping out food and energy in the core reading that the Fed prefers to focus on. The numbers reflect “a notable slowing from 2022 that was widespread across both goods and services prices.”
“Longer-term inflation expectations appear to have remained well anchored, as reflected by a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets,” he added.
Powell is likely to face a variety of questions during his two-day visit to Capitol Hill, which starts with an appearance Wednesday before the House Financial Services Committee and concludes Thursday before the Senate Banking Committee.
Though the Fed tries to stay out of politics, the presidential election year poses particular challenges.
Former President Donald Trump, the likely Republican nominee, was a fierce critic of Powell and his colleagues while in office. Some congressional Democrats, led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, have called on the Fed to reduce rates as pressure builds on lower-income families to make ends meet.

2024-03-11T16:15:14.521Z,The Body Shop shuts down in the U.S. after filing for bankruptcy,NBC News,"The Body Shop is shutting down its U.S. operations after filing for bankruptcy.
The U.K.-based chain filed for Chapter 7 liquidation in New York last week, according to a court filing. The filing means the company's U.S. operation will sell off certain assets to pay back its creditors. Earlier this month, the beauty store confirmed it had filed for restructuring in its home country, the United Kingdom, as well as in Canada.
While some stores in those countries will remain open, the chain indicated it was shuttering its remaining U.S. locations.
A Body Shop spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. According to The Guardian, some 50 locations in the U.S. were operational at the time of the bankruptcy filing.
Launched in 1976 in Brighton, U.K., by entrepreneur and rights activist Anita Roddick (using the name of an earlier store founded in Berkeley, California), Body Shop was acquired for the equivalent of $1.3 billion in 2006 by beauty giant L'Oréal. It subsequently changed hands again before being acquired by a private equity group in December for approximately $250 million.
But the company collapsed in February, with administrators citing mismanagement and a challenging retail landscape.
“The Body Shop has faced an extended period of financial challenges under past owners, coinciding with a difficult trading environment for the wider retail sector,” the administrators said in a statement according to Reuters.

2024-03-08T13:32:50.196Z,"U.S. added 275,000 jobs in February, more than expected — but unemployment rate climbs",NBC News,"Three years ago, the U.S. economy went through an unprecedented upheaval as millions of workers left low-paying jobs for more promising ones. At the same time, many white-collar workers cemented themselves into remote, or at least hybrid, positions that gave them more flexibility.
It was called the ""great resignation.""
Fast-forward to today, and the situation looks like a mirror image, economists say. Specifically, on average, few workers are leaving their jobs, though they still do not face the prospect of imminent layoffs.
At the same time, the rate of hiring has dropped significantly. Some economists have begun calling it the ""great stay.""
On Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the U.S. economy added 275,000 jobs in February, up from a revised 229,000 in January and above the 198,000 expected by economists.
The solid job growth data, combined with an unemployment rate that, at 3.9%, is usually a sign of a healthy labor market, is colliding with other, more worrisome trends.
“We’re seeing that the job market is getting cooler,” said Guy Berger, director of economic research at the Burning Glass Institute, a labor research group. “It’s still not a bad one, but it’s looking more like what we saw in the mid 2010s — which was not a terrible job market but still a worse one than what we saw later that decade or what we had in the post-pandemic period.”
The labor market faces an unusual set of crosscurrents that makes it hard to predict whether the economy can maintain its strength in the medium term and beyond, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics.
In addition to quits being down, he noted that hours worked have, in some instances, been cut back to recessionary levels. On Thursday, the agency reported a 3.3% decrease in hours worked for manufacturing — the largest such decline since the historic drop-off in the second quarter of 2020.
Cuts among temporary jobs have also picked up, Zandi said, which can often signal that cuts to full-time positions are in the offing.
""It feels fragile,"" he said.
At the same time — and despite some high-profile headlines reflecting thousands of roles eliminated over the past year — actual layoff rates remain below pre-pandemic levels.
Yet here, too, there are worsening signs. The job placement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas on Thursday reported the highest level of layoff announcements for any February since the global financial crisis.
“As we navigate the start of 2024, we’re witnessing a persistent wave of layoffs,” Andrew Challenger, the firm’s labor and workplace expert, said in a statement. “Businesses are aggressively slashing costs and embracing technological innovations, actions that are significantly reshaping staffing needs.”
Zandi noted that firms' profit margins are starting to decline amid higher interest-rate costs, which could put further pressure on their payrolls.
In general, he said, ""the market just feels like it's all over the place.""
Unfortunately, if you’re looking for a job, it appears to be taking longer to find a new one. Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows the number of people experiencing unemployment for 15 to 26 weeks has climbed 53% since it hit a low in March 2022.
“If someone needs to find a new job or wants to find a better job, the opportunities right now are more limited, aside from a few fairly narrow sectors,” Berger said.
The industries doing the most hiring include health care and social services, which are expanding thanks to the aging population, and government services, whose offers of lower salaries, on average, are increasingly seen as competitive given the relative lack of other new opportunities elsewhere in the private sector, Berger said.
Given the still low rate of layoffs in the broader economy, Berger is optimistic that the ""great stay"" can be sustained. An example of a firm holding its headcount steady is Amazon, which has trimmed payrolls from post-pandemic highs, but which remain significantly above pre-pandemic levels.
“We are investing, and we are adding in some areas,” Brian Olsavsky, Amazon’s chief financial officer, said on a conference call with reporters following the company’s quarterly results. “But there’s a general feeling in most teams that we’re looking to hold the line on headcount, perhaps go down as we can drive efficiencies.”
There remains reason for some optimism. Job openings remain well above pre-pandemic levels. In a follow-up interview, Andrew Challenger pointed out that the U.S. has had three consecutive months of net new job growth, including a 12-month high of 353,000 jobs added in January. The January number was revised downward to 229,000.
""It's still a very good labor market,"" he said. ""There are certainly companies that want to keep people; people are staying. But there's also increased layoff activity. They don’t have to be correlated — sometimes it's just volatility.""
Yet, in February, employers announced plans to hire just 10,317 workers, for a total of 15,693 so far in 2024, the lowest year-to-date total for announced hiring plans since Challenger, Gray & Christmas began its tracking in 2009, the company found.
The broader picture remains an unusual one, Berger said.
""There are relatively few new people coming in, but relatively few people are leaving,"" he said. ""It's a weird environment.""

2024-03-06T20:29:11.547Z,'So darn easy': IRS' free Direct File pilot program already a hit with early users,NBC News,"Texan Dixie Warden is quick to say she’s “not a numbers girl.” But as the first user of the government’s new free electronic tax return filing system, Warden reports she completed her taxes this year in about an hour using the program.
“I don’t want to call myself a dummy, but this is taxes for dummies right here,” Warden said. The program asked her simple questions about her tax status, provided definitions for tax lingo such as adjusted gross income and a chatbot was on hand to answer her questions.
The project, known as Direct File and launched by the IRS on a limited basis in 12 states this tax season, is in its pilot phase. Starting this week, it is available for eligible users to start their returns at any time after earlier being available only during certain hours.
If it is successful and scaled up for the general public’s use, the program could drastically change how Americans file their taxes and how much money they spend completing them. That is, if the agency can see the program through its development in spite of threats to its funding.
Warden, a 37-year-old IRS employee from Kyle, Texas, says she saved nearly $400 this tax season by filing her tax return directly to the government from her home laptop instead of paying one of the commercial tax prep services used by millions of people. Individual taxpayers pay an average of $140 preparing their tax returns each year.
Warden has worked for the IRS in a variety of roles for the past 16 years, but she is not a tax expert. She’s currently a human relations specialist.
“The way that it was laid out was just so darn easy to understand and I just see it being helpful for so many millions of people,” she said.
While Warden’s praise of the program might seem natural given her employer, a broader test is under way now as people around the country give it a try.
The IRS began its pilot program in fits and starts in 12 states, around timed windows, for people who have very simple W-2s, an employee’s wage and tax statement.
The agency estimates that hundreds of thousands of mostly lower-income taxpayers will participate in the program during the 2024 filing season.
The slow introduction is in part meant to avoid a repeat of the disastrous rollout of the Obama administration’s health insurance program under the Affordable Care Act in 2013, which was rife with website crashes and glitches.
The IRS initially invited government workers to use the program and Warden was the very first. Now members of the public are starting to participate.
Derek Wheeler, director of the Low-Income Taxpayer Clinic at the University of Florida’s Law School, said his clinic has referred less than a dozen clients to the Direct File system. Florida is one of the 12 states participating in the pilot. So are New Hampshire, Nevada, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, Wyoming, Arizona, Massachusetts, California and New York.
“The benefit of a program like this, that is simple for users, is immense,” Wheeler told The Associated Press.
His legal clinic has partnered with the IRS and selectively identifies clients who may be eligible to submit their taxes through the program.
The IRS faces intense blowback from private tax preparation companies that have made billions from charging people to use their software and have spent millions lobbying Congress on the issue.
One of their biggest criticisms is that free tax prep services already exist for people of all income brackets and developing the Direct File system will end up costing taxpayers billions of dollars.
Several organizations offer free online tax preparation assistance to taxpayers under certain income limits. Also, fillable forms are available online on the IRS website, but the forms are complicated and taxpayers still have to calculate their tax liability.
A Government Accountability Office report from April 2022 found that while 70% of taxpayers were eligible for the IRS’s existing free-filing program, only 3% of taxpayers actually use the service.
Critics include Grover Norquist, president of the conservative Americans for Tax Reform, who says the agency is “better off not wasting taxpayer money on Direct File” and should promote the programs that are already available. He also argues the IRS did not receive explicit authority from Congress to create the program.
The IRS was tasked with looking into how to create a “direct file” system as part of the money it received from the Inflation Reduction Act, which President Joe Biden signed into law in 2022. It gave the IRS nine months and $15 million to report on how such a program would work.
The IRS published its feasibility report last May and estimated that annual costs for new program would range from $64 million for 5 million users to $249 million for 25 million users.
“They didn’t get the authorization for the pilot program and Congress has said, ‘Nobody authorized this. This is a violation of the law,’” Norquist said.
IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel insisted during a recent House hearing that the agency has both “a responsibility and an authority to offer taxpayers different approaches for how to meet their tax obligation.”
Vanessa Williamson, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, says free-filing tax options in the United States do not measure up to what other nations offer their citizens. For instance, Germany, Japan, Britain and other Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries all offer taxpayers some form of pre-populated tax document to approve, sign and return.
“This is not a problem we have solved yet,” she said. “The U.S. does have a markedly complex income tax system, but it’s very clear that if this could be done in other countries it’s something that should be done here.”
Wheeler, at the University of Florida, adds that “having as many options as possible for people to file their taxes is important and brings us closer to other countries that send their taxpayers pre-populated forms.”
“We may never get to that point, but this is a start.”
For the program to continue to grow, it will need continued funding under the Inflation Reduction Act, which included $80 billion for the IRS.
House Republicans are trying to claw back some of the money. They built a $1.4 billion reduction to the IRS into the debt ceiling and budget cuts package passed by Congress last summer. A separate agreement will take an additional $20 billion from the IRS over the next two years to divert to other nondefense programs.
Warden says she hopes she’ll be able to use the program again next tax season, and that it will be expanded for others.
“I never had the confidence to do my own taxes,” she said. But after using Direct File, she said, “I feel foolish for paying all that money every year.”

In a recent letter posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's website, GM said 570,434 trucks may be affected by the issue, which may cause tailgates to inadvertently unlatch as a result of a short-circuit from water intrusion.
Affected models include 2020 through 2024 Chevy Silverados and GMC Sierras.
In addition, approximately 249,000 vehicles sold in Canada are affected by the recall, according to records on Canada's motor vehicle recall database.
Earlier this month, GM said the recall affected approximately 323,000 U.S. vehicles.
GM has not received any reports of major injuries or property damage related to the issue. Only 1% of the recalled vehicles are estimated to have the defect.

2024-03-12T12:32:40.778Z,Consumer prices climbed 3.2% in February as 2% goal remains elusive,NBC News,"The biggest economic story of the post-pandemic period has been inflation.
It's a narrative that, at first, had two clear phases. First came the breakneck acceleration in price growth amid reopenings and job changes, when the 12-month inflation rate surged from less than 1% in June 2020 to more than 9% in June 2022.
Then the fever appeared to break, with price growth slowing over the next 12 months to just 3.1% in June 2023.
Yet it is now clear that a third chapter has emerged: a stall. For the past nine months, the annual rate of inflation has held between 3% and 4%.
On Tuesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the Consumer Price Index climbed 3.2% in the 12-month period ending in February — missing expectations of a slightly lower 3.1% reading and coming in higher the 3.1% in January.
On a month over month basis, prices climbed 0.4% in February compared to 0.3% in January. That was in line with expectations. But the so-called core reading, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, came in at 0.4%, above expectations for a reading of 0.3%.
""Inflation remains unusually high,"" Jason Furman, a Harvard economics professor who was head of the White House Council of Economic Advisers in the Obama administration, wrote Tuesday morning on X. He noted core inflation has actually been kicking higher over the past several months when three-month averages are considered.
Experts began warning last year that the so-called last mile of the marathon toward the 2% goal would be the hardest. It now appears those fears have been borne out.
""I think that the market got ahead of itself when it came to how fast we'd get back to 2%,"" said Michael Antonelli, managing director and market strategist at the financial group Baird & Co.
The biggest hurdle, he said, has been getting what the Bureau of Labor Statistics refers to as shelter costs to come down. Those costs come in two main categories: rent and homeownership, called owners-equivalent rent.
Both categories have now spent months defying forecasts of a meaningful slowdown in price growth, remaining above 6% on a 12-month basis in January.
In February, shelter costs once again proved stubbornly high, climbing 5.7%.
""The components we thought would have reduced, especially shelter, which comprises the bulk of CPI — it’s a gigantic weight in the composition of the index — we thought would have dropped further,"" Antonelli said.
On Monday, the real estate group Redfin reported rents climbed 2.2% year over year, to $1,981 in February. That's the largest gain since January 2023. Month over month, it increased 0.9%.
Some of the data about the strength of the economy going forward remains conflicting. Last week's employment report showed that while the economy continued to add jobs at a healthy clip, the unemployment rate ticked upward.
Other factors remain at work, too. Supply-chain issues, particularly related to trouble in the Red Sea, may start showing up again in the form of higher goods prices, analysts with Citibank told clients in a note Monday.
“We do not expect inflation data over the coming months will be an overwhelming contrast to strong January data,” the Citi analysts wrote.
Antonelli said the market and the economy remain healthy — so much so that instead of the ""soft landing"" hoped for by the Fed, in which inflation continues to fall without a significant increase in unemployment, consumers are now looking at a ""no landing"" scenario.
That is not necessarily a bad thing. It just means that above-forecast inflation is most likely here to stay for some time.
""A 'soft landing' implies we are near some kind of ground, but we’ve bounced into the 'no landing' category,"" Antonelli said. ""We're in a situation where we have good demographics, a vibrant economy, a tailwind with [artificial intelligence], the housing market is strong — all the things we see the economy now doing.""
Workers, however, are barely keeping their heads above water, with wages having only marginally outpaced inflation. Today, inflation-adjusted weekly earnings total about $371, compared with $367 in the months just before the pandemic.
""It's like having your pocket picked and then seeing that a bill happened to fall out,"" said Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst and Washington bureau chief for the financial group Bankrate. ""You’re able to put it back in — but you’re not getting any restoration from the damage in purchasing power.”
For the Fed, the fact that it has raised interest rates without setting off an unemployment crisis means those rates are likely to remain high for some time as it sees greater risk from prices accelerating again compared with the threat of rapidly rising unemployment.
While traders are betting that the first interest rate cut of the post-pandemic period will arrive in June, a new Reuters survey found respondents now believe there will be fewer rate cuts this year than had been forecast.
In his recent testimony to Congress, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the first rate cut of the post-pandemic period would most likely come this year — but he could not say when, given the ongoing inflationary pressures.
Other forecasters see a global economic situation that could keep the U.S. at 3% inflation indefinitely. David Andolfatto, a former Fed official who now chairs the University of Miami business school's economics department, said ongoing geopolitical turmoil and demand for defense spending will most likely keep the pace of price growth firm.
Ongoing federal budget deficits — a phenomenon that both political parties have signaled little willingness to resolve — are not helping, either.
""These types of economies tend to run hot,"" Andolfatto said. ""I just see fiscal pressures from either side, and getting inflation back down — compared with the previous decade, where we were undershooting — I just think that world is gone.""

2024-02-24T12:00:00.000Z,"Why everyone is suddenly talking about Nvidia, the trillion-dollar company fueling the AI revolution",NBC News,"The business world is increasingly banking on artificial intelligence to be the next big thing, and has found itself turning to one maker of computer chips in particular — Nvidia — to power the revolution.
Since 1993, the Santa Clara, California-based company has been designing programmable chips that help run an array of consumer-facing applications.
While Intel and Advanced Micro Devices had dominated the U.S. chip sector for decades, Nvidia’s entry signaled the advent of sophisticated graphics processing units (GPUs), which were better able to render images. That capability became ever more important as high-quality video increasingly dominated the tech and media landscape.
At first, Nvidia was most associated with providing GPU processors for video game consoles like the Microsoft Xbox and Sony PlayStation.
The general growth of Silicon Valley during the 2010s prompted Nvidia to diversify and improve its fortunes. For example, in 2014, Nvidia and Google announced a partnership to use Nvidia chips in Google Chromebooks.
Auto companies also began turning to Nvidia chips for use in driver-assistance software that depends on GPUs to process image information from sensors. Nvidia hardware is also found in all Tesla vehicles.
During the pandemic, the shift to remote work and subsequent demand for data centers that could enable cloud-based computing — plus even more interest in video games while everyone was stuck indoors — accelerated Nvidia’s revenues even further.
Still, the company’s $22 billion in annual revenues in 2022 remained dwarfed by rival Intel’s $63 billion that year.
It was not until the last year and a half or so that Nvidia’s outlook went truly stratospheric with the onset of the artificial intelligence revolution.
The chips that Nvidia specializes in, known as “discrete” GPUs, specialize in so-called parallel computing. This is a type of computing in which multiple processes are carried out simultaneously. By contrast, CPUs carry out programs serially, or sequentially. The type of computing GPUs handle is thus more efficient and more valuable than CPUs.
Programmers have learned that Nvidia’s GPUs are much better suited for programming AI software.
Bloomberg News has called Nvidia’s chips the “workhorse for training AI models,” and PNC Financial Services Group analyst Amanda Agati described Nvidia’s lead in the category last fall, based on its valuation, as a “quasi monopoly.”
So Nvidia owes some of its success to having pioneered the technology that AI applications now depend upon.
Today, virtually every major tech company, including Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft and Oracle, has made use of Nvidia chips.
On Thursday, Nvidia reported earnings and revenues that significantly surpassed market expectations, helping lift the company’s overall value past $2 trillion, trailing only Microsoft and Apple among the largest U.S. firms.
“Accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point,” Nvidia CEO and co-founder Jensen Huang said in the earnings release. “Demand is surging worldwide across companies, industries and nations.”
About $1.7 trillion of the market capitalization growth has come in the past 16 months alone, according to Goldman Sachs. Huang acknowledged in an interview with CNBC last year that a combination of luck and skill has led to the company’s success.
“We just believed that someday something new would happen, and the rest of it requires some serendipity,” Huang said. “It wasn’t foresight. The foresight was accelerated computing.”
For Moody’s Senior Vice President Raj Joshi, Nvidia represents the “dominant” infrastructure player behind the current rise of the AI sector.
While other chip designers are working to catch up to Nvidia, the company’s three decades’ worth of GPU specialization — compared with a competitor like Intel, which has historically specialized in CPUs — represents a massive advantage, he said.
“This emerging field [AI] is better supported by GPUs,” Joshi said in an interview with NBC News, adding: “Nvidia is providing the foundation for it in most cases.”
Nvidia also offers solutions for other sectors, like health care, that are not specifically tech-oriented, Joshi said.
“They have a big lead in these markets,” he said.
Nvidia’s specialization means it is able to charge a premium for its products. In fact, its chips, which are manufactured in Taiwan, are so unique that companies looking to build AI capabilities are complaining that there is a shortage of them.
While the Biden administration’s 2022 CHIPS and Science Act is designed to spur development of GPUs — and do so on U.S. shores — there is already concern about keeping up with market forces.
“The volume of chips that [AI companies] project they need is mind-boggling,” U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said this week. She suggested even more federal subsidies would be needed if the U.S. hoped to be a meaningful player in chip manufacturing.
“I suspect there will have to be — whether you call it ‘CHIPS Two’ or something else — continued investment if we want to lead the world,” Raimondo said during a virtual appearance at an Intel event. “We fell pretty far. We took our eye off the ball.”
In the meantime, investor interest in Nvidia remains frenzied. While some have speculated that its success might be a bubble, most Wall Street analysts say its financial statements have been proof that its product is viable.
“The health of their core data center business is genuinely stunning,” Goldman Sachs’ Tony Pasquariello wrote in a note to clients Friday.
Because it is now so much more valuable, Nvidia’s financial results carry greater weight for the overall stock market, namely the S&P 500 index. According to Agati, who is chief investment officer and managing executive for investments at PNC, 60% of the earnings growth among all S&P 500 companies for the most recent quarter came from Nvidia alone.
In other words, for the moment, as Nvidia goes, so goes the market, which could be a financial boon for consumers who hold investments in the stock market — whether individually, or through their retirement accounts.
“[Nvidia] has become critical to the market’s path forward,” Agati said in an email to NBC News, adding: “In the saying ‘data is the new oil,’ Nvidia continues to prove it is in a league of its own.”

2024-03-05T13:47:47.627Z,Biden to launch task force to crack down on 'unfair and illegal pricing' amid rising inflation,NBC News,"President Joe Biden on Tuesday will launch a new task force to take on “unfair and illegal” corporate pricing, which Biden sees as a major reason why consumers are not yet feeling the impact of cooling inflation rates and a strong economy.
The task force will be jointly led by the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice, two agencies at the forefront of the Biden administration’s aggressive regulatory agenda over the past three years.
“We’re excited to be co-chairing the president’s new Strike Force on Unfair and Illegal Pricing, which builds on the FTC’s far-reaching work to promote competition and tackle unlawful business practices that are inflating costs for Americans,” FTC Chair Lina Khan told reporters on a call Monday.
Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust Jonathan Kanter will co-chair the strike force along with Khan.
“Here at the Justice Department, we are confronting some of the world’s most powerful corporations so that we can improve the lives of American families, Kanter said on the call.
On Tuesday afternoon, Biden will convene the sixth formal meeting of the White House Competition Council, a group of top official throughout the administration who are tasked with rooting out anti-competitive practices across a wide range of industries.
“Over the last year supply chains have returned to normal and inflation has come down,” said National Economic Council Director Lael Brainard on the call. “Some corporations aren’t passing those savings on to consumers...President Biden is fed up with corporate practices that unfairly raise costs for consumers and he’s taking action.”
In advance of the council meeting, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will release a final rule to cut credit card late fees. The Agriculture Department will also release finalized protections for farmers against potentially discriminatory processing practices.
The announcements and the meeting are part of Biden’s ongoing crusade against corporate pricing practices that he claims are unfair. The White House believes they contribute directly to the public perception that the economy is doing poorly, despite data that objectively shows a strong U.S. economy.
“The competition council and its members have worked to bring down costs and everything from hearing aids to asthma inhalers to Epi pens to air travel, ” said Brainard.
Still, questions remain about precisely what actions regulators have the legal authority to take to address companies that exercise their pricing power more aggressively than others.
“There are dozens of statutes on the book across all of these agencies that can, in certain situations, be brought to bear where high prices are harming consumers,” a senior administration official said on the Monday call. “And it depends on how and when.”
Biden has pointed to what he says is “price gouging” and “shrinkflation” as two examples of corporate pricing strategies that keep profits high, even when wholesale and transportation costs drop.
But two months into the election year, the narrative of a strong economy may finally be taking hold with voters who have so far not given Biden credit for the economy’s soft landing. Instead, they have blamed him for the post-pandemic elevated cost of living.
Four new polls released over the weekend pointed to signs of growing economic optimism among respondents.
Nonetheless, the polls still showed Biden trailing his likely November opponent, twice-impeached former President Donald Trump, in a head-to-head hypothetical general election contest.

2024-03-04T14:16:59.938Z,JetBlue and Spirit Airlines terminate $3.8 billion merger,NBC News,"JetBlue Airways and Spirit Airlines on Monday said they were terminating their merger agreement weeks after losing a federal antitrust lawsuit that challenged the deal.
A federal judge blocked the attempted merger in January after the Justice Department sued to bar the deal last year alleging the acquisition would stifle competition in the airline industry and eliminate Spirit as a discount alternative for price-conscious travelers.
JetBlue and Spirit appealed the judge’s decision a couple of days later, but JetBlue noted the appeal was required under the terms of the merger agreement.
Spirit shares tumbled 17% in premarket trading, while shares of JetBlue were up roughly 4%.
“It was a bold and courageous plan intended to shake up the industry status quo, and we were right to compete with Frontier and go for an opportunity that would have supercharged our growth and provided more opportunities for crewmembers,” JetBlue CEO Joanna Geraghty said in a note to staff Monday.
“However, with the ruling from the federal court and the Department of Justice’s continued opposition, the probability of getting the green light to move forward with the merger anytime soon is extremely low.”
JetBlue’s prospective purchase of Spirit would have been a buoy for the struggling discounter airline, which is facing the grounding of dozens of its Airbus planes for inspections stemming from a Pratt & Whitney engine defect. Spirit expects compensation from the engine maker as a result of the flaw.
With the deal off the table, Spirit must confront its financial problems alone, something its leaders say it is equipped to do.
The company said it was working to refinance its debt, and last month said it was on a path back to profitability thanks to better-than-expected demand. It projected revenue for the first quarter above analysts’ expectations.
“Throughout the transaction process, given the regulatory uncertainty, we have always considered the possibility of continuing to operate as a standalone business and have been evaluating and implementing several initiatives that will enable us to bolster profitability and elevate the Guest experience,” Spirit CEO Ted Christie said in a release.
He said Spirit shareholders received $425 million in prepayments from JetBlue during the agreement, and that JetBlue will pay Spirit $69 million related to the agreement’s termination.

2024-02-16T11:30:40.000Z,"Federal regulators are probing whether Cash App leaves door open to money launderers, terrorists",NBC News,"Federal financial regulators are exploring allegations by two whistleblowers that Cash App, the popular mobile payment platform, and entities providing transaction services to its users performed inadequate due diligence on customers, potentially opening the door to money laundering, terrorism financing and other illegal activities.
While banks are required to know the true identity of every customer, the Cash App program “had no effective procedure to establish the identity of its customers,” the whistleblowers said. In their complaints, reviewed by NBC News, the whistleblowers detail an array of questionable Cash App transactions with entities under sanction by the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, operations known to sell personal information and credit card data for illegal purposes, and offshore gambling sites barred to U.S. citizens.
Among the big-name companies partnering with Cash App are Visa Inc., the giant payment processor, and Wells Fargo.
The whistleblowers filed their complaint with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, a unit of the U.S. Treasury that administers the Bank Secrecy Act and analyzes financial transactions to combat money laundering, terrorist financing and other illicit activities. Early last month, FinCEN officials spoke at length with the whistleblowers, their lawyer told NBC News, and said they were referring the complaint to internal investigators as well as to other federal agencies. As is its custom, FinCEN declined to comment on the existence of the submission.
Over three-quarters of U.S. adults have used a mobile payment app, such as Cash App, PayPal or Venmo, according to a 2023 study by the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau. But these services, also known as person-to-person payment platforms, pose risks to their users and to the financial system, regulators say. In recent years, for example, law enforcement officials have cited criminals’ use of payment apps to evade laws, such as laundering stolen Covid relief funds in 2020.
Customers of Cash App, introduced in 2013, can instantly send and receive money among themselves, and buy stocks and Bitcoin. They can also spend or withdraw funds using Cash Card, a prepaid Visa debit card. As of September 2023, Cash App had 55 million active transacting accounts and generated $239 billion of inflows during the prior four quarters, the company said. Cash App is so popular it has been referenced in hundreds of rap songs, sometimes in connection with illegal activities.
In addition to FinCEN, the whistleblowers made submissions alleging due diligence flaws at Cash App to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the nation’s top securities cop, and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, which combats fraud in the market for digital assets, their lawyer said. The SEC declined to comment on the existence of a whistleblower submission; the CFTC did not respond to a request for comment.
“There are obvious national security issues here and it would be foolhardy for the public to think that regulators and law enforcement are keeping pace with the financial ‘innovators,’” said Edward Siedle, a former SEC enforcement lawyer who represents the whistleblowers. NBC News interviewed the whistleblowers, who are knowledgeable on financial services compliance issues, on the condition of anonymity.
The whistleblowers’ filings arrive as regulators are increasing scrutiny on deficient anti-money laundering practices. On Monday, FinCEN proposed a rule that would require investment advisers to adopt systems to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing and report suspicious transactions to the agency. Such advisers oversee trillions of dollars but are not currently subject to these requirements, FinCEN said.
And in December 2022, federal prosecutors and the SEC took action against Danske Bank, Denmark’s largest, for lying about inadequate transaction monitoring systems that allowed tainted money to enter the U.S. financial system. The bank pleaded guilty to defrauding banks through its lax compliance and forfeited $2 billion. And
Cash App is not a bank and uses an array of banking partners to conduct certain of its services. Wells Fargo, for example, holds Cash App users’ funds in a pooled deposit account, making them eligible for FDIC insurance. Until 2021, Lincoln Savings Bank of Iowa handled incoming deposits by Cash App customers. Sutton Bank, a nine-branch institution in Attica, Ohio, issues Cash App’s prepaid Visa debit cards.
Prepaid debit cards are a platform for potential illegality, according to a 2020 report from Standard & Poor’s Global Market Intelligence. It described how payment processors, banks and other issuers of prepaid debit cards are “exposed to criminal activity that could lead to reputational damage and run-ins with regulators.”
The whistleblowers’ allegations cover 2016 through 2022 and describe “a shadow financial system beyond the reach of regulators” where due diligence on Cash App’s users was negligible and often did not adhere to sound banking practices and rules. In addition, Cash App’s use of different institutions providing services for users prevents bank regulators from seeing the full scope of the transactions at the institutions they monitor, the submissions say. The siloed structure of the Cash App machine, the whistleblowers say, “misdirects the attention of regulators.”
Lax due diligence on Cash App customers poses risks for shareholders of its parent, Block Inc., the enormous fintech founded by Jack Dorsey, co-founder of Twitter, the whistleblowers said. Ditto for Marqeta Inc., a financial technology startup that acts as a middleman transferring funds for Cash App transactions, and Visa Inc., whose name is on the Cash Card. Shareholders of all three companies have not been fully advised of the risks associated with the Cash App business, the submissions contend.
On Feb. 9, Larry Summers, a former Treasury secretary, resigned from the board of Block, effective immediately, after more than a decade of service. The company said his resignation was not a result of disagreements over its operations or practices and that he was departing to devote more time to his other commitments.
Lincoln Savings Bank, with locations in central and northeastern Iowa, is also highlighted in the complaints. Lincoln began handling customer deposits into Cash App accounts in 2016, the complaints said, and was responsible for conducting due diligence required under banking laws to determine their identities and ensure their funds were not tainted by illegal activities. Lincoln’s vetting process was minimal and did not align with regulations, the complaints allege; Cash App pressed Lincoln to forgo traditional customer due diligence to ease the process of opening accounts and to generate revenues, the whistleblowers said.
NBC News described the whistleblowers’ allegations to Cash App and asked it to comment on them. A spokesperson, who communicated with NBC News on the condition of anonymity, declined to respond on the record. Statements attributable to the company were provided on background via email.
“The bank partnership model allows Cash App to offer certain financial services products (such as the Cash App Card) that are a benefit to our customers and further our purpose of economic empowerment,” the statement said. The company performs due diligence on customers, the statement continued, employing “several hundred people who support Cash App’s Know Your Customer/due diligence, anti-money laundering and related compliance functions, and augment that workforce with supplemental staffing and resources.”
Like all financial services companies, the company added, “Cash App is not immune to bad actors attempting to use the platform for illicit purposes.” It partners with law enforcement “to help disrupt illegal or illicit activity.”
The spokesperson did not respond to allegations that the company pressured Lincoln Savings Bank to minimize due diligence and declined to say why Cash App stopped working with Lincoln in 2021. Cash App’s bank partnership model and fund-flows structure “are standard in the industry,” the statement said, “and are known to regulators. We collaborate with our bank partners on controls and monitoring for the activities they are responsible for.”
A representative at Visa Inc. declined to comment on the whistleblowers’ allegations, and Lincoln Savings Bank did not respond to requests for comment.
A Marqeta spokesman said in a statement: “We take our obligations seriously and stand behind our disclosures regarding the risks associated with our business.”
Wells Fargo said it takes its obligations under anti-money laundering laws seriously and that it requires its payment services clients such as Cash App to do the same. “We conduct ongoing due diligence, including account analysis and monitoring, and where we identify suspicious activity, we report it,” the bank said in a statement.
Sutton Bank, issuer of the Cash App prepaid debit card, confirmed it has no way of knowing the sources of funds transferred from Cash App accounts to the debit card for withdrawals. Those funds come into the bank in large commingled blocks from Marqeta when a customer uses the Cash Card at an ATM or store.
“We’re an issuer to the card product to spend funds that you have with Block in your Cash App account, but that’s it,” said Mark T. Dabertin, Sutton’s general counsel and chief compliance officer. “We track ongoing monitoring of the spending activity for the card; we don’t get any visual into how the money gets in there. We report on unusual activity affecting the card usage.” Sutton’s compliance staff is “a very robust group,” he said.
Cash App is a money machine for Block, generating net revenue of $10.4 billion during the first 9 months of 2023, or 65% of Block’s net revenue, its regulatory filings show. Cash App produced $2.9 billion in gross profit for Block during the first 9 months of 2023, up 37% year over year, the company said. Block has a market value of $38 billion.
In 2016, Cash App began working with Lincoln Savings Bank to handle customers’ deposits into their accounts. Lincoln, which opened in 1902 as a one-branch agricultural bank in Iowa, is now a fintech pioneer with $1.8 billion in assets.
Its LSB Financial Technologies unit offers virtual cards, mobile wallets and payment processing and “has created processes to allow for something unusual in banking — speed.”
Working with Cash App, Lincoln Savings Bank opened a pooled account where Cash App participants’ money was deposited and held briefly until it was transferred by Marqeta to Sutton Bank for Cash Card use or to Wells Fargo. When Cash App customers want to spend funds or withdraw money at an ATM, their Cash Cards are loaded with money from their Cash App account. At all other times, the Cash Card has a zero balance, Sutton says.
This setup meant that neither Lincoln Savings Bank nor Sutton Bank could monitor both the people sending the money and those withdrawing it, the whistleblowers explained. Lincoln only saw the incoming money while Sutton watched it exit. Cash App and Marqeta, neither of them banks, have views of the entire transactions, the whistleblowers said.
In the rush to attract Cash App users, neither Cash App nor Lincoln performed extensive due diligence on customers, the whistleblowers contend. For example, Cash App allowed access to the Lincoln pooled bank account for customers presenting just an email address or a phone number, the complaint said, and Lincoln “had no effective procedure to establish the identity of its customers.” Under traditional due diligence programs, federal banking regulations require a bank to obtain a customer’s name, date of birth, home address, and full Social Security number or other identification number.
To receive a Cash App Visa prepaid debit card, the complaint says, a user would provide a name, date of birth and only the last four digits of their Social Security number and a “mailing address” for the card. This is not the same as a home address and could include post office boxes, the complaint notes. Most of the Visa cards were “virtual” and sent to a customer’s email address, the whistleblowers said.
The Cash App spokesperson said the company receives full Social Security numbers of customers from a vendor.
In 2018, Cash App began offering transactions in bitcoin, opening the app’s flawed customer due diligence to terrorist financing worldwide, the whistleblowers said. The Cash App spokesperson disputed this, saying bitcoin customers must go through full identity verification and ongoing sanctions screening.
Marqeta, based in Oakland, California, creates digital payment technologies and provides issuer processor and card manager services. It launched its platform publicly in 2014, and Marqeta issued shares to the public in 2021 at $27 each. Today the company’s stock trades around $6.
Block is Marqeta’s largest customer, generating 72% of Marqeta’s net revenue during the first nine months of 2023, regulatory filings show. For the first nine months of 2023, 77% of Marqeta payment transactions went through Sutton Bank.
Visa’s involvement in the Cash Card is problematic because of the potential for illegal activity, the complaints say. “Visa has its own compliance requirements and tight limitations on the issuance and use of prepaid cards,” the complaint alleges, but it waived standard anti-money laundering restrictions for Cash App. The whistleblowers speculated that this may have occurred because in 2017, Visa led a $25 million investment in Marqeta with some of the startup’s existing investors.
The whistleblowers told NBC News that Cash App seemed to heighten its due diligence on customers in 2023 and a Cash App executive confirmed that the company currently requires new customers to provide a full nine-digit Social Security number.
But, the whistleblowers say, Cash App appears not to have closed accounts that were opened with inadequate vetting. Evidence for this, they said, can be seen in the market for buying access to Cash App accounts set up in the earlier years of the program when due diligence was spotty and creating the accounts didn’t require identifying information, which allows buyers to avoid the due diligence involved in setting up a new account. Existing Cash App accounts offered for sale on the internet, can go for above $150, up from $50 previously, the whistleblowers told NBC News.
Scrutiny of digital payment systems like Cash App is rising at other agencies. In November, the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau proposed new federal oversight of companies offering digital payment apps. “Big Tech and other companies operating in consumer finance markets blur the traditional lines that have separated banking and payments from commercial activities,” the bureau said in the November announcement. That blurring can put consumers at risk, the bureau said.

2024-02-14T16:29:14.947Z,Don't freak out about the stock market's inflation freakout,NBC News,"Stock markets threw a tantrum Tuesday, posting big losses after slightly hotter-than-expected inflation data stoked worries that interest rate cuts may not be coming soon.
But don’t freak out. Markets tend to overreact. January’s consumer price index report is just one number in an overall trend that has been moving steadily in the right direction. Inflation has cooled from a 6.4% annual growth rate in December 2022 to less than half that a year later.
“It’s important not to overreact and jump to the assumption that an inflationary resurgence is developing,” Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, wrote in a note to clients.
She added that January’s number, while higher than expected, was driven in part by segments that are less important for the Federal Reserve as it weighs inflation against potential rate cuts. “Forward looking indicators suggest they will ease over the coming months,” Shah wrote.
Goldman Sachs economists, meanwhile, said inflation in January was propped up by new-year price increases for medical services, car repair and insurance, and child care. “We assume inflation in these categories returns to the previous trend on net in February and March,” they wrote.
So why such big losses in the market?
Investors have fully priced in a so-called “soft landing” — cooling down inflation and the hot economy without a recession. That assumption is a key driver behind a big rally in stocks over the past year. The S&P 500 recently topped 5,000 for the first time ever, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has hit record highs, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has rallied 30% in the past year.
For investors, after months of stock market gains and soft-landing certitude, Tuesday’s losses are a reminder about potential risks. Still, markets could easily bounce back.
January’s inflation data may also be what economists call “noise,” representing something outside the overall trend. A big part of the inflation surprise was a 0.6% jump in shelter costs from December. Most economists forecast shelter inflation — particularly rent — to ease substantially this spring.
In the meantime, the economy is strong. The job market remains robust. Wages are rising faster than inflation.
Because the Fed traditionally cuts rates in a slowing economy, though, they may sit out a while longer, perhaps until June instead of May. And the inflation watch continues.
The “hotter-than-expected inflation reading emphasizes the persistent upside risks that continue to percolate in the U.S. economy,” said Kayla Bruun, senior economist for Morning Consult. Wage growth is adding purchasing power to already robust consumer spending.
It’s “a strong combination that, if persistent, could hinder sustained moderation of inflation,” she said.

2024-02-14T21:50:28.586Z,Self-driving Cruise vehicle accused of nearly hitting kids in two separate close calls one day apart,NBC News,"Cruise, the driverless car company owned by General Motors, is back in the spotlight after another close call with a pedestrian.
The California Department of Motor Vehicles is investigating allegations that a self-driving vehicle operated by Cruise nearly hit a 7-year-old boy after it failed to yield to him and his family while they crossed the street in San Francisco last year, according to DMV records obtained by NBC News.
The family says the driverless Cruise car headed straight toward them as they crossed the street.
The car “was fully stopped, and then it started when he had gotten maybe a third of the way or halfway across the intersection,” said Sascha Retailleau, who was crossing 20th Street near the intersection of York Street with his wife and son in their Mission District neighborhood on the evening of Aug. 14. “It started to accelerate towards us like we weren’t there.”
Retailleau said the car swerved as it approached, right toward his young son, Luke, who said he had to rush ahead to avoid being hit. Retailleau reported the incident to the DMV, which told NBC News it couldn’t disclose any details of its ongoing investigation.
“If I didn’t run, it would have hit me, probably,” said Luke, 7. “I felt scared.”
An eerily similar near-miss was caught on camera just the day before in the city’s Pacific Heights neighborhood. The video, posted to the website Reddit and later obtained by regulators, shows a Cruise car accelerating straight toward two women and two children walking in a crosswalk. The vehicle then brakes and swerves around them at the last second.
Cruise acknowledged its vehicle was involved but declined to comment further, citing an ongoing federal investigation.
As for the similar near-collision reported by Retailleau, Cruise said its records show none of its driverless cars traveled through the specific intersection around the time Retailleau and his family were crossing the street.
“We have reviewed data and video in response to this complaint, but to date, we have not identified a Cruise driverless [autonomous vehicle] traveling in the locations on the dates or times provided that encountered any pedestrians,” Cruise spokesperson Erik Moser said. “We are committed to operating with safety and transparency and continue to investigate this incident.”
Retailleau, a mechanical engineer who has built robots himself, says there’s no mistaking what he saw that day: a driverless Cruise car with the company’s signature orange stripe.
“We were scared at first, and then I was just angry, super angry,” Retailleau said. “My kid could have been hurt or killed by this Cruise vehicle.”
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is investigating at least four incidents involving Cruise vehicles and pedestrians, including the one posted on Reddit.
“The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) has received reports of incidents in which Automated Driving System (ADS) equipped vehicles operated by Cruise LLC (Cruise) may not have exercised appropriate caution around pedestrians in the roadway,” the agency stated in a summary of its investigation.
Retailleau reached out to Cruise to explain how one of its driverless cars nearly hit his son, but after he gave the company all the details it asked for, he said, he is still waiting to hear back more than five months later.
“There was no apology,” he said. “There was no ‘we’ll try to make this right.’”
Cruise acknowledged to the NBC Bay Area Investigative Unit that it never replied to the family, adding that it apologizes for the lack of communication.
Retailleau said: “They shouldn’t be allowed to have 2,000 pounds of metal rolling through the streets of San Francisco, potentially endangering other people. Here is a company that is beta testing on the public.”
The embattled car company is at the center of at least five separate state and federal investigations looking into its safety record and whether it purposefully misled regulators and the public. Cruise denies the accusations.
Cruise’s fleet of 400 driverless cars has been grounded since October. It suspended operation of its driverless vehicles in San Francisco; Austin, Texas; Phoenix; and Houston after California regulators determined the company posed an “unreasonable risk to public safety.” Cruise hasn’t announced when or where it expects to get its cars back on the road.
Cruise declined an interview request from NBC News. In a statement, it said that “we are focused on advancing our technology and earning back public trust.”
Critics, including top lawmakers, continue to argue the driverless car industry lacks oversight, saying regulations have failed to keep up with the technology.
Late last year, NBC News exposed a loophole that has allowed driverless cars in California to avoid penalties when they break the rules of the road. Across the state, traffic tickets issued for moving violations must be issued to actual drivers, according to the DMV, so driverless vehicles have essentially been immune from those fines.
“It’s really been a very glaring hole in the law,” said California Assembly member Phil Ting, who represents communities in San Francisco and nearby San Mateo counties. “This is new technology, and we have to get it right the first time.”
Ting wants driverless car companies held liable and the traffic tickets sent to them when their vehicles violate traffic rules, so he is pushing for a new state law after the recent NBC News investigation.
“Really appreciate that story for coming out and highlighting, frankly, the need for the legislation that I’m introducing,” Ting said. “I think your specific story validates everything I’ve been hearing in San Francisco.”
The Autonomous Vehicle Industry Association, which represents the largest driverless car companies in America, says it is willing to support closing the legal loophole.
“It has never been the expectation of the autonomous vehicle industry that our vehicles are not able to be ticketed,” CEO Jeff Farrah said. “If there is clarification that needs to be made in California on this issue … we are committed to sitting down and working that through with the appropriate policymakers.”
If Ting’s legislation passes, it most likely wouldn’t take effect until 2025, giving autonomous vehicles about another year of traffic ticket amnesty before they begin facing the same types of penalties and fines as human drivers.
“There’s no way for law enforcement to really hold them accountable,” Ting said. “There’s no way for law enforcement to really engage with these vehicles.”

2024-02-28T21:19:24.035Z,"Forget a new bathroom, just fix the faucet: Consumers take a break from big home renovations",NBC News,"Households are hitting pause on their tub-to-shower conversion plans and buying new shower curtains instead.
After a pandemic-era renovation craze, the nation’s two largest home improvement retailers say customers are spending less on big projects in favor of cheaper do-it-yourself fixes.
Lowe’s said this week that it’s seeing shoppers cut back on kitchen and bathroom purchases and becoming more cautious about buying big-ticket appliances.
“Those who did engage in home improvement activities took on smaller, nondiscretionary projects with a heightened focus on value,” Lowe’s CEO Marvin Ellison told investors when the company reported its fourth-quarter earnings Tuesday. Sales dropped 6.2% compared to a year ago, which the retailer blamed on “persistent inflation and a stagnant housing market.”
A week earlier, Home Depot, the largest U.S. home improvement chain, reported its own sales dip, declining 3.5% in the fourth quarter from the year before.
“Major home renovation projects are on hold as consumers watch their finances, but they still have an appetite for lower-cost improvements they can do themselves,” said Joe Derochowski, home industry adviser at the market data company Circana.
Rising prices appear to be the main reason for consumers’ home renovation pullback. Circana data shows retail sales revenue for kitchen and bath projects declined just 1% from 2020 to 2023 — but unit sales were down 25% over that period, suggesting customers’ budgets are stretching across fewer items thanks to inflation.
The pace of consumer price increases has slowed dramatically, with the annual rate landing just above 3% last month after peaking over 9% in mid-2022. But after three straight months of improvement, consumer confidence ticked down in February, with a slight dip in household expectations for making large purchases in the next six months.
Home improvement spending has been cooling for months, Lowe’s and Home Depot have said, after a frenzy to upgrade both newly purchased homes and those where people suddenly found themselves spending more time together during Covid lockdowns.
But while the action has died down, households appear to be deferring, not ditching, their more ambitious renovation projects.
They didn’t imagine that a bathroom might cost 20, 30 grand to remodel.
Contractor Emmanuel Forge
Home Depot Chief Financial Officer Richard McPhail told analysts last week that business is dragging “at a lesser degree than we faced in 2023,” adding that “our market is on its way back to normal demand conditions.”
Derochowski expects many consumers to revisit their pricier plans later in 2024. “There is pent-up demand that will bring opportunity for spending on larger home improvement projects over the coming year as the economy improves,” he said.
Emmanuel Forge, a traveling contractor who posts home-renovation advice on TikTok and Instagram under his Remodel School brand, said he’s had no trouble finding work lately. But he said many homeowners underestimate how much projects cost, and some abandon their aspirations after doing the math.
“They didn’t imagine that a bathroom might cost 20, 30 grand to remodel,” Forge said. “They thought it might be five grand and a weekend or two.”
Contractors’ and home improvement retailers’ businesses are closely tied to the housing market.
As 30-year fixed mortgage rates dipped below 3% in 2020, existing home sales soared to an adjusted annual peak rate of 6.6 million, according to the National Association of Realtors. Americans poured money into fixing up their properties at the same time. Comparable sales skyrocketed 29% at Lowe’s and 25% at Home Depot in the fourth quarter of 2020.
But as the Federal Reserve lifted interest rates to more-than-20-year highs to quell inflation, mortgage rates rose, too. By the end of last year, 30-year rates flirted with 8%, cooling existing home sales to an annual rate of around 4 million, as more would-be buyers held back. Fewer home sales means fewer homeowners looking to renovate.
Materials costs have risen in recent years, driven up by the supply chain snags of 2021 and 2022, and labor costs have soared as well. Average hourly earnings for specialty trade contractors jumped 16% from December 2020 to December 2023, keeping pace with the increases all workers saw during that period, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
The higher costs are one reason Forge said he could see homeowners opting not only for smaller projects but ones they can tackle on their own.
“Maybe instead of them buying $3,000 of cabinets to install themselves, they’re just going to paint them with $300 of paint,” he said.

2024-03-06T14:23:18.674Z,"At a growing list of airports, TSA PreCheck travelers no longer have to show physical IDs or boarding passes",NBC News,"If you're a TSA PreCheck member traveling on United Airlines via Chicago's O'Hare or Los Angeles international airports, life just got a bit easier.
United recently updated its website to show that ""Touchless ID"" technology, which lets users go through security just by scanning their faces and without having to show physical IDs or boarding passes, is now available at those two major hubs for TSA PreCheck users.
In addition, United passengers at O'Hare can use their faces at a new bag-drop shortcut.
To enroll in United's Touchless ID, passengers need to scan their passports and add their Known Traveler Numbers in the United app. They then need to check in for their flights on the mobile app to opt in and give United permission to use their facial scans as IDs.
Once at the airport, passengers would only need to scan their faces at new Touchless ID kiosks.
For now, Touchless ID at United is available only for customers on single-passenger reservations who are at least 18 years old. And the bag-drop feature at O’Hare is still in a testing phase, meaning agents will still check IDs.
United says it plans to continue rolling out Touchless ID to more bag-drop counters, security checkpoints and boarding gates.
Delta Air Lines has already deployed similar technology at its hubs in Atlanta and Detroit and at New York's John F. Kennedy and LaGuardia international airports.
Clint Henderson, the managing editor of The Points Guy travel website, there are already dedicated check-in lanes for touchless at those airports for Delta flyers.
“The agents working at the TSA PreCheck and Clear lines told me to use a new special lane for biometrics that allowed me to skip ahead of both the regular PreCheck and the separate Clear lanes,” Henderson said in a TPG post. “After one minute, the TSA agent waved me over. I simply showed my face in front of a camera, and the agent told me to go ahead to the screening machines. There was no wait.”
In November, the Department of Homeland Security, the TSA's parent agency, announced it hopes to roll out an entirely ""self-service"" screening option that bypasses TSA agents entirely. It involves the use of ""pods"" that combine facial screening and baggage scanning; the program is being tested at Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas.
On its website, TSA says it does not store images captured by facial recognition technology ""except for a limited period of time for testing and evaluation purposes."" It says it retains personal identifying information only for as long as is necessary to fulfill the specified purposes of its biometric technology pilots.

2024-03-10T11:00:00.000Z,"'Buy now, pay later' goes from niche to normal as young people use it for daily essentials",NBC News,"Buying now and paying later is still a popular way to splurge on airfare to Cabo. It’s an increasingly common way to buy groceries and lawn furniture, too.
Consumers ages 35 and under comprise 53% of “buy now, pay later” users but just 35% of traditional credit card holders, according to LexisNexis Risk Solutions. Many of those core “BNPL” borrowers have grown so comfortable using the installment loans for just-out-of-reach luxuries that they’re putting more everyday purchases on them as well.
Apparel and accessories were the most popular product category among millennial (ages 30-44) and Gen Z (18-29) users of the BNPL provider Afterpay in 2021 and 2022. But last year it fell to fourth place behind “arts, travel and entertainment,” “home and garden” and “hardware,” according to data the company provided to NBC News.
The shift adds to signs that fast-growing BNPL services, which let users break up transactions into several payments with little or no interest, are becoming a routine tool in young adults’ wallets as they adapt to higher prices.
Afterpay’s youngest users’ spending on many staples has surged by double and triple digits, with contact lenses soaring 465% from 2022 to 2023, garbage bags jumping 182% and first-aid antiseptics rising 98%. Their spending growth for lighter fluid, laptop parts and snoring and sleep apnea aids all surpassed 300%.
Young borrowers are making similar moves on rival services, too. Benjamin Espinoza, 27, recently stocked his fridge using a discount promotion from Instacart and selected Klarna at checkout, using the BNPL provider to spread out his roughly $40 bill.
It sucks that these are the avenues that I have to go through.
Klarna user Benjamin Espinoza, 27
“It sucks that these are the avenues that I have to go through,” said the San Antonio, Texas, video editor, who lives with three roommates.
Espinoza said he made less than $7,000 last year after earning his bachelor’s degree in history two years ago. He acknowledged most BNPL services don’t help consumers build credit for timely repayment but said, “It’s good that it’s here in the moment.”
Jasmine Parker, 30, also uses Klarna for groceries, including when she’s waiting for a paycheck. It allows her to buy everything she wants rather than forgo a few items, but she said she usually pays her full balance after the second installment comes due “so I don’t have to worry about it.”
“I don’t like owing a bunch of money,” said Parker, who works in customer service and lives in the Raleigh-Durham area of North Carolina, adding that the thought of her student loans stresses her out.
It isn’t just BNPL borrowers in their 20s and 30s making the shift toward essentials. Grocery purchases by shoppers of all ages have expanded their slice of online BNPL loans by 40% since this time last year, according to Adobe — a bigger jump than any other product category — while electronics’ share shrunk by 14%.
Some users on TikTok and X, formerly Twitter, have been trading BNPL-based grocery hacks to cope with higher costs.
“Being able to use afterpay for groceries is a finesse,” one X user posted in December. “Just buy an e giftcard to the grocery store and send it to yourself.” Afterpay said gift cards and certificates are the second-fastest-growing purchase in its arts and entertainment category by millennial and Gen Z customers.
Many borrowers have flocked to BNPL to avoid credit cards with interest rates of 20% or higher. But younger users’ opting to pay for more necessities in installments also reflects the mini-loans’ growing ubiquity in an economy where many consumer prices have swelled.
BNPL providers “got integrated really well and really quickly” into mobile shopping during the pandemic recovery, said Vivek Pandya, lead analyst at Adobe Digital Insights. The services now “have consumers who are very plugged in. So that convenience factor, the ease with which they can kind of move through the BNPL payment process, through their online transaction, has really kept the growth persistent.”
Most BNPL services make money by charging commission fees from merchants when customers apply one of their instant loans at checkout. Afterpay’s retail partners include sellers of household staples such as 1-800-Contacts and PetSmart. In December, rival provider Affirm announced it was expanding to self-checkout kiosks at Walmart’s 4,500 U.S. stores, bringing the option within closer reach of shoppers stocking up on basics.
Nonessentials are still growing fast on BNPL services, too.
Afterpay said travel ticket spending surged 1,430% from the previous year among its youngest users. Affirm told NBC News those purchases are taking off on its platform as well: Travel and ticketing was Gen Zers’ fastest-growing category last year and nearly doubled in volume overall. It was among the fastest-growing purchases for millennials as well, but their top category by volume was “general merchandise, as they increasingly utilized flexible pay-over-time options for everyday purchases,” the company said.
A Klarna spokesperson said, “While it’s not our place to tell people how to shop or where to buy, we do think it’s our role to give people choice, convenience and flexibility when it comes to paying for everyday purchases like groceries and household goods.”
Some analysts worry the growth and popularity of BNPL services could spur more risky spending.
Researchers at the New York Federal Reserve recently found BNPL customers use the services differently depending on their finances. Those on shakier footing tend to use them like credit cards “to make medium-size, out-of-budget purchases frequently,” they wrote. More financially stable users turn to BNPL less regularly but do so largely to avoid credit-card interest for big purchases.
It has been a great way to help me with money management.
Afterpay user Deijanae Duncan, 36
Deijanae Duncan, 36, said she first started using Afterpay for beauty and fashion purchases, and then for cruise tickets. More recently, she’s used it to buy glasses for herself and sports equipment for her three sons.
“It wasn’t like I was experiencing any financial hardship,” said Duncan, who lives in Los Angeles and works as a project manager for a federal agency. “It has been a great way to help me with money management.”
The New York Fed researchers said purchases under $250 were among the most common for both types of borrowers they examined. While financially stable customers were far more likely to use BNPL services for pricier purchases around the $2,000 mark, even low-dollar installment loans can add up, especially for users with many open at once.
Still, BNPL can be a responsible option, said Kevin King, vice president of credit risk and marketing strategy at LexisNexis Risk Solutions.
“In a lot of ways, we’d rather have people who are in a tough financial position financing essential goods with this than financing a $400 Nordstrom purchase, which has its time,” he said.

2024-03-09T01:03:27.003Z,Sam Altman rejoins OpenAI board of directors,NBC News,"OpenAI on Friday announced its new board and the wrap-up of an internal investigation into the events leading up to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s ouster.
Altman will also rejoin OpenAI’s board.
The new board members are:
The three new members will “work closely with current board members Adam D’Angelo, Larry Summers and Bret Taylor as well as Greg, Sam, and OpenAI’s senior management,” according to a release.
OpenAI will continue to expand the board moving forward, according to a Zoom call with reporters.
OpenAI did not publish the investigation report by U.S. law firm WilmerHale but provided a summary of the findings.
“The review concluded there was a significant breakdown of trust between the prior board and Sam and Greg,” Taylor said, adding that the review also “concluded the board acted in good faith... [and] did not anticipate some of the instability that led afterwards.”
Taylor also said the board’s concerns did not arise regarding concerns over product safety and security, OpenAI’s finances or statements to customers or business partners, that it was “simply a breakdown in trust between the board and Mr. Altman.”
WilmerHale’s investigation began in December, and the lawyers on Friday submitted their report, which included dozens of interviews with OpenAI’s prior board members and advisors, current executives and other witnesses. The investigation also involved reviewing more than 30,000 documents, according to a release.
“We have unanimously concluded that Sam and Greg are the right leaders for OpenAI,” Taylor, the chair of OpenAI’s board, said in a release.
“I am very grateful to Bret and Larry and WilmerHale,” Altman said on the Zoom call with reporters. He added, speaking of CTO Mira Murati, “Mira in particular is incremental to OpenAI all the time ... but through that period in November, she has done an amazing job helping to lead the company.”
He added that he is “excited to be moving forward here” and for the situation to be “over.” He also mentioned he wished he had acted differently regarding differences in opinion with the board.
In November, OpenAI’s board ousted Altman, prompting resignations — or threats of resignations — including an open letter signed by virtually all of OpenAI’s employees, and uproar from investors, including Microsoft. Within a week, Altman was back at the company, and board members Helen Toner, Tasha McCauley and Ilya Sutskever, who had voted to oust Altman, were out. Adam D’Angelo, who had also voted to oust Altman, stayed on the board.
When Altman was asked about Sutskever’s status on the Zoom call with reporters, he said there were no updates to share.
“I love Ilya... I hope we work together for the rest of our careers, my career, whatever,” Altman said. “Nothing to announce today.”
Since then, OpenAI has announced new board members, including Taylor, former co-CEO of Salesforce, and former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers. Microsoft obtained a nonvoting board observer position.
After ChatGPT’s launch in November 2022, it broke records at the time as the fastest-growing consumer app in history, and now has about 100 million weekly active users, along with more than 92% of Fortune 500 companies using the platform, according to OpenAI.  Last year, Microsoft invested an additional $10 billion in the company, making it the biggest AI investment of the year, according to PitchBook.
The rollercoaster couple of weeks at the company are still affecting it months later.
This month, billionaire tech magnate Elon Musk sued OpenAI co-founders Altman and Greg Brockman for breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty, court filings revealed Thursday.
In his complaint, Musk and his attorneys allege that the ChatGPT maker “has been transformed into a closed-source de facto subsidiary of the largest technology company in the world: Microsoft.” They also argue that this arrangement goes against a founding agreement and 2015 certification of incorporation that OpenAI established with Musk, who was a pivotal donor to a cofounder of OpenAI in its early years.
As part of Microsoft’s contract with OpenAI, the tech giant only has rights to OpenAI’s “pre-AGI” technology, and it is up to OpenAI’s board to determine whether the company has reached that milestone. Musk argued in his filing that since the OpenAI board shuffle in November — when Toner, McCauley and Sutskever were removed — the new board is “ill-equipped” to independently determine whether OpenAI has reached AGI and therefore whether its technology is outside the scope of the exclusivity deal with Microsoft.
Lawyers told CNBC that they had doubts about the legal viability of Musk’s case, and OpenAI has said it plans to file a motion to dismiss all of Musk’s claims.
In response to the high-profile lawsuit, OpenAI reproduced old emails from Musk in which the Tesla and SpaceX CEO encouraged the rising startup to raise at least $1 billion in funding, and agreed that it should “start being less open” over time and “not share” the company’s science with the public.
Musk’s lawsuit also follows some controversy over Altman’s previous chip endeavors and investments.
In 2018, Altman personally invested in an AI chip startup called Rain Neuromorphics, based near OpenAI’s San Francisco headquarters, and in 2019, OpenAI signed a letter of intent to spend $51 million on Rain’s chips. In December, the U.S. compelled a Saudi Aramco-backed venture capital firm to sell its shares in Rain.

2024-03-07T20:52:41.507Z,Aldi to add 800 new U.S. grocery stores by 2028,NBC News,"Grocery giant Aldi plans to add 800 new stores in the U.S. over the next five years.
The German-owned, Illinois-based chain said in a release Thursday it plans to build or expand hundreds of Aldi locations in the company's existing Northeast and Midwest strongholds, as well as in the western U.S. and Southern California. A first Las Vegas location is planned, too.
Meanwhile, in the Southeast, the company will convert many Winn-Dixies and Harveys locations into Aldis, though ""a meaningful"" number of them will remain under their current brands. Aldi said Thursday its acquisition of Southeastern Grocers, the parent company of Winn-Dixie and Harveys, had been completed.
Aldi said it expects that about 50 stores will begin the conversion process in the latter half of 2024, with the majority of them reopening as Aldi in 2025.
“Our growth is fueled by our customers, and they are asking for more Aldi stores in their neighborhoods nationwide,” CEO Jason Hart said in the statement. He continued, ""With this commitment to add 800 stores in the next five years, we’ll be where our shoppers need us while positively impacting the communities we serve.""
According to SupermarketNews.com, Aldi was the 13th-largest U.S. grocer as of last summer — only slightly larger than Dollar General in terms of market share — but it currently ranks as the fastest-growing grocery retailer in the U.S.
Known for its lower prices via private-label selections, Aldi has ambitious growth plans that represent a viable threat to established players — especially in Southeastern markets like Florida, according to a report from the market research group Dunnhumby.
“Retailers everywhere should be examining their private brand, pricing, assortment, digital, and real estate strategies in response to Aldi’s move, to build protective moats for an uncertain future,” a report on Aldi from last summer said, according to GroceryDive.com.

2024-02-21T17:12:34.864Z,Stanley tumbler 'quenchers' maker is being sued over lead claims,NBC News,"The parent company of viral sensation Stanley tumbler quenchers is being sued over claims that it deceived customers over the presence of lead in the products.
The suit, filed earlier this month as a potential class-action case by a Seattle-based firm, alleges Stanley parent Pacific Market International did not publicly confirm the presence of lead in the products until this January.
In that statement, PMI said the stainless steel vacuum seal insulation at the bottom of each tumbler covers a pellet that contains lead, some of which is melted during the manufacturing process.
But the potential for exposure to a user is minimal, PMI said.
“Rest assured that no lead is present on the surface of any Stanley product that comes into contact with the consumer nor the contents of the product,” the statement said, adding that its team was also working on a lead alternative for the component.
However, the suit alleges, if the tumbler is damaged or worn, the seal can break and potentially expose the user to lead.
The ""quencher"" version of the Stanley tumblers have gone viral over the past year thanks to their colorful, Instagram-ready looks. CNBC reported last year that the products now bring in some $750 million in annual revenues.
More recently, clips of Stanley drinkers using at-home lead testing kits on their products have also gone viral.
But experts told NBC's Today show last month that the reliability of those tests is questionable, and that the odds of serious lead exposure are negligible.
""There really is practically zero risk of you ingesting any of the lead that’s in this cup,” Jack Caravanos, doctor of public health and professor of environmental public health sciences at New York University’s School of Global Public Health, told Today.
Nevertheless, the suit alleges that even in its January statement, Stanley and PMI continued to mislead customers because it did not warn consumers about the potential for exposure from damage to the vacuum seal. Nor did PMI disclose how much lead is present in each tumbler cup.
“As the manufacturer and designer of these products, the Stanley Defendants knew or reasonably should have known about this lead issue for years but chose to conceal it from the public presumably to avoid losing sales,” the suit alleges.
In addition to an order demanding Stanley stop its allegedly deceptive practices, the suit also seeks unspecified damages.
PMI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

2024-03-01T18:24:48.965Z,Boeing is in talks to reacquire fuselage maker Spirit Aerosystems after spate of quality defects,NBC News,"Boeing is in talks to buy back Spirit Aerosystems, which makes fuselages for Boeing’s 737 Max jets, according to a person familiar with the matter, as both companies scramble to stamp out manufacturing flaws on the top-selling plane.
Shares of Spirit were up 13% as of early afternoon on Friday, while shares of Boeing were down about 1%. Spirit Aerosystems had a market capitalization of $3.3 billion as of Thursday’s close.
“We do not comment on market speculation,” a spokesperson for Spirit Aerosystems told CNBC. Boeing also declined to comment.
Boeing in 2005 spun off operations in Kansas and Oklahoma that became the present-day Spirit Aerosystems. About 70% of Spirit’s revenue last year came from Boeing, and about a quarter comes from making parts for Boeing’s main rival, Airbus.
The repurchase talks were first reported by the Wall Street Journal.
It comes less than two months after a section of a Boeing 737 Max 9 plane blew out during an Alaska Airlines flight. The Federal Aviation Administration temporarily grounded all of the planes in January, leading to investigations into the accident and Boeing’s production lines.
It was the latest and most serious in a host of flaws on the Boeing 737 Max, Boeing’s best-selling jet.
The bolts on the door plug of the Max involved in the January accident appeared not to have been attached when it left Boeing’s Renton, Washington, factory, according to a preliminary report from the National Transportation Safety Board.
Boeing has disclosed several production problems and quality flaws on the fuselages that Spirit makes, including incorrectly drilled holes and incorrect spacing on some fuselage components, problems that slowed deliveries of new jets to airlines.

2024-03-11T16:15:14.521Z,The Body Shop shuts down in the U.S. after filing for bankruptcy,NBC News,"The Body Shop is shutting down its U.S. operations after filing for bankruptcy.
The U.K.-based chain filed for Chapter 7 liquidation in New York last week, according to a court filing. The filing means the company's U.S. operation will sell off certain assets to pay back its creditors. Earlier this month, the beauty store confirmed it had filed for restructuring in its home country, the United Kingdom, as well as in Canada.
While some stores in those countries will remain open, the chain indicated it was shuttering its remaining U.S. locations.
A Body Shop spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. According to The Guardian, some 50 locations in the U.S. were operational at the time of the bankruptcy filing.
Launched in 1976 in Brighton, U.K., by entrepreneur and rights activist Anita Roddick (using the name of an earlier store founded in Berkeley, California), Body Shop was acquired for the equivalent of $1.3 billion in 2006 by beauty giant L'Oréal. It subsequently changed hands again before being acquired by a private equity group in December for approximately $250 million.
But the company collapsed in February, with administrators citing mismanagement and a challenging retail landscape.
“The Body Shop has faced an extended period of financial challenges under past owners, coinciding with a difficult trading environment for the wider retail sector,” the administrators said in a statement according to Reuters.

2024-03-01T17:33:13.297Z,"A year after Silicon Valley Bank failed, another regional lender flashes warning signs",NBC News,"Regional lender New York Community Bank finds itself in an apparently worsening predicament, just as the anniversary of last year’s banking turmoil nears.
Shares of the troubled lender plunged 25% Friday to below $4 apiece after NYCB restated recent quarterly earnings lower by $2.4 billion, formally replaced its CEO and delayed the release of a key annual report.
The most worrying development, though, is directly tied to investors’ fears about commercial real estate and shortfalls the bank reported in a key aspect of its business: NYCB said that poor oversight led to “material weaknesses” in the way it reviewed its portfolio of loans.
The disclosure is a “significant concern that suggests credit costs could be higher for an extended period,” Raymond James analyst Steve Moss said Thursday in a research note. “The disclosures add to our concern about NYCB’s interest-only multi-family portfolio, which may require a long workout period unless interest rates decline.”
In a remarkable reversal of fortunes, a year after deposit runs consumed regional lenders including Silicon Valley Bank, NYCB — one of the perceived winners from that period after acquiring a chunk of the assets of Signature Bank following government seizure — is now facing existential questions of its own.
The bank’s trajectory shifted suddenly a month ago after a disastrous fourth-quarter report in which it posted a surprise loss, slashed its dividend and shocked analysts with its level of loan-loss provisions.
Days later, ratings agency Moody’s cut the bank’s credit ratings two notches to junk on concerns over the bank’s risk management capabilities after the departure of NYCB’s chief risk officer and chief audit executive.
At the time, some analysts were comforted by the steps NYCB took to shore up its capital, and noted that the promotion of former Flagstar CEO Alessandro DiNello to executive chairman boosted confidence in management. The bank’s stock was briefly buoyed by a flurry of insider purchases indicating executives’ confidence in the bank.
More from CNBC:
DiNello became CEO as of Thursday after his predecessor stepped down.
Now, some are questioning the stability of NYCB’s deposits amid the tumult. Last month, the bank said it had $83 billion in deposits as of February 5, a slight increase from year-end. Most of those deposits were insured, and it had ample resources to tap if uninsured deposits left the bank, it said.
“NYCB still has not provided an update on deposits, which we can only infer they are down,” D.A. Davidson analyst Peter Winter said Thursday in a note.
“The question is, by how much?” Winter asked. “In our view, corporate treasurers were reassessing if they are going to keep deposits at NYCB when their debt rating was downgraded to junk.”
In a statement released Friday announcing a new chief risk officer and chief audit executive, NYCB CEO DiNello noted that he had identified the material weaknesses disclosed Thursday and is “taking the necessary steps to address them, including appointing new executives.”
The bank’s allowance for credit losses isn’t expected to change, he added.
“The company has strong liquidity and a solid deposit base, and I am confident we will execute on our turnaround plan,” DiNello said.
The pressure on NYCB’s operations and profitability amid elevated interest rates and a murky outlook for loan defaults has raised questions as to whether NYCB, a serial acquirer of banks until recently, will be forced to sell itself to a more stable partner.
Ben Emons, head of fixed income for NewEdge Wealth, noted that banks trading for less than $5 a share are perceived by markets as being at risk for government seizure.
NYCB stock notched a 52-week low of $3.32 per share on Friday.
“We expect more questions on whether NYCB will sell,” Citigroup analyst Keith Horowitz said in a note. “But we do not see a lot of potential buyers here even at this price due to the uncertainty … in our view, NYCB is on its own.”
A NYCB representative didn’t immediately return a request for comment.

New hire classes will be paused in May and June and will likely resume in July, Marc Champion, vice president of flight operations, and Kirk Limacher, vice president of flight ops planning and development, told staff Thursday in a memo, which was seen by CNBC.
“We wanted to let you know that United will slow the pace of pilot hires this year due to continued new aircraft certification and manufacturing delays at Boeing,” they wrote.
Boeing didn’t immediately comment.
Boeing has been struggling with a host of production flaws like incorrectly drilled holes on the fuselage and the fallout from a door plug that blew out of a nearly new Boeing Max 9 operated by Alaska Airlines on Jan. 5, which prompted a brief grounding of the aircraft type earlier this winter. Bolts appeared to be missing on the plane when it left Boeing’s factory, a preliminary investigation found.
United was contracted to receive 43 Boeing 737 Max 8 and 34 Max 9 models this year, but expects to get 37 and 19 of them, respectively, according to a company filing. It also had contracted deliveries of 80 Max 10s in 2024, the largest model in the bestselling Max family, but expects none of them this year. The plane hasn’t yet been certified yet by the Federal Aviation Administration and is years behind schedule.
United’s CEO, Scott Kirby, in January said the carrier is making a fleet plan without the Max 10.
“As you know, United has hundreds of new planes on order and while we remain on a path to be the fastest growing airline in the industry, we just won’t grow as fast as we thought we would in 2024 due to continued delays at Boeing,” Champion and Limacher said Thursday. “For example, we had contractual deliveries for 80 MAX 10s this year alone — but those aircraft aren’t even certified yet and it’s impossible to know when they will arrive.”

2024-03-06T20:08:42.501Z,Oscar Mayer is launching a plant-based hot dog,NBC News,"An iconic American sausage maker is about to offer a meat-free option.
Oscar Mayer announced Wednesday the launch of plant-based NotHotDogs and NotSausages.
It's a joint venture between Oscar Mayer parent Kraft Heinz and TheNotCompany, a Chile-based food-tech company backed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. The venture is called The Kraft Heinz Not Company, stylized as TheKraftHeinzNotCo.
""Oscar Mayer NotHotDogs and NotSausages offer the savory and smoky experience that brand fans have known and loved for more than 140 years,"" the brand said in a release.
An analysis cited by Kraft forecasts the meat-alternative market to more than double by 2030. However, many meatless hot dogs and dinner sausages currently on offer have failed to capture consumers because of flavor and texture concerns, Kraft said.
“We know people are hungry for plant-based meat options from brands they know and trust,” Lucho Lopez-May, the CEO of The Kraft Heinz Not Company, said in a release. “In launching the joint venture’s first product in the plant-based meat category, we saw an opportunity to satisfy these consumer cravings, leveraging NotCo’s revolutionary AI technology and the power, equity, and legacy of the Oscar Mayer brand.”
In addition to a traditional hot dog, flavors on offer from the new lineup include bratwurst and Italian sausage. The new products may contain less saturated fat and cholesterol than traditional Oscar Mayer beef products, but they may contain more sodium, as well as more protein.
In a follow-up statement to NBC News, the company said ingredients included in the new product lineup include bamboo fiber, mushroom, pea protein and acerola cherry, also known as Barbados cherry or West Indian cherry.
Kraft Heinz and NotCo have already launched plant-based cheese slices, mayo, and mac & cheese products.

2024-02-08T15:19:29.402Z,"Average credit card balances jump 10% to a record $6,360 as more consumers fall behind on payments",NBC News,"Credit card debt has notched another new high.
Americans now owe $1.08 trillion on their credit cards, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported Tuesday.
Balances jumped 10% from a year ago, according to a separate quarterly credit industry insights report from TransUnion, with the average balance per consumer hitting $6,360, also a historic record.
“Consumers are just spending more,” said Charlie Wise, senior vice president of global research and consulting at TransUnion. “Even though the inflation rate is down, that doesn’t mean prices are coming down.”
To be sure, prices are still rising, albeit at a slower pace than they had been.
The consumer price index — a key inflation barometer — has fallen gradually from a 9.1% pandemic-era peak in June 2022 to 3.4% in December 2023.
Meanwhile, households continue to show signs of strain — more cardholders are carrying debt from month to month or falling behind on payments.
Credit card delinquency rates jumped across the board, the New York Fed and TransUnion found. Credit card delinquencies surged more than 50% in 2023, the New York Fed reported. According to TransUnion’s research, “serious delinquencies,” or those 90 days or more past due, reached the highest level since 2009.
“Consumers are struggling with their payments,” Wise said, and “I think we will continue to see those delinquencies tick up.”
“It’s not all bad news,” said Ted Rossman, Bankrate’s senior industry analyst. Cardholders who pay their bill in full every month reap the benefits of cash back and travel rewards without paying interest.
“The big fork in the road is whether or not you carry a balance,” he said.
In that case, credit cards are one of the most expensive ways to borrow money. The average credit card charges a record-high 20.74%, according to Bankrate.
At more than 20%, if you made minimum payments toward this average credit card balance, it would take you more than 17 years to pay off the debt and cost you more than $9,000 in interest, Rossman calculated.
Still, consumers often turn to credit cards, in part because they are more accessible than other types of loans.
Overall, an additional 20.1 million new credit accounts were opened in the fourth quarter of 2023, boosted in part by subprime borrowers looking for additional liquidity, according to Wise. Subprime generally refers to those with a credit score of 600 or below, according to TransUnion.
Many people in this group are millennials, he said, who are burdened by high levels of student loan debt and the housing affordability crisis.
“If you can’t afford to buy and your rent keeps going up, that’s not a very happy set of circumstances,” Wise said.
“My favorite tip is to sign up for a 0% balance transfer credit card,” Rossman said.
Cards offering 12, 15 or even 21 months with no interest on transferred balances are out there, he added, and “these allow you to consolidate your high-cost debt onto a new card that won’t charge interest for up to 21 months, in some cases.”
Borrowers may also be able to refinance into a lower-interest personal loan. Those rates have climbed recently, as well, but at just under 12%, on average, are still well below what you currently have on your credit card.
Otherwise, ask your card issuer for a lower annual percentage rate. In fact, 76% of people who asked for a lower interest rate on their credit card in the past year got one, according to a LendingTree report.

2024-02-02T21:16:21.262Z,The great American jobs machine keeps revving in an election year,NBC News,"People who bet on a slowdown in the U.S. job market lost again last month.
The economy added 353,000 jobs in January, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Friday. That’s nearly double what economists expected and well above the already-respectable monthly average of 255,000 for 2023. Wages also grew a stronger-than-expected 4.5%, and the jobless rate stayed in a tight range at 50-year lows.
“The labor market is the little engine that could,” said John Leer, chief economist at the business intelligence firm Morning Consult.
The White House leaned into the numbers, as President Joe Biden seeks re-election this year. Officials view the data as vindication of Biden’s policies, such as passage of the Inflation Reduction Act and investments in semiconductors and science. Jared Bernstein, chairman of the president’s Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), called the report an “unequivocal story” that is good for the overall economy and working families.
“With easing inflation, we’ve now got wages handily beating prices, meaning more buying power,” Bernstein told reporters after the report was released Friday. “This is at the heart of a very virtuous ongoing cycle where the tight job market, strong job gains and wage growth outpacing price growth is consistently boosting consumer spending.”
To be sure, while consumer sentiment has improved recently, approval of the president’s handling of the economy is low.
The overall strength in the job market also complicates the work of the Federal Reserve, which has raised interest rates to tamp down inflation. With the economy still strong, the central bank will likely wait longer to cut rates, delaying relief for consumers saddled with high credit card balances and mortgage rates.
“There is absolutely no sign of a softening labor market or weakening wage pressures,” says Seema Shah, chief global strategist for Principal Asset Management.
Still, White House economic advisers hope a sustained period of strong wages and slowing inflation will help household budgets and continue to show up in improving sentiment indicators.
Likewise, Leer thinks strong jobs growth, rising wages and falling inflation make the outlook for consumer spending this year “encouraging.”
“So encouraging that it feels less appropriate to cut interest rates before seeing some evidence of a moderation in economic activity,” he said.
Indeed, the cooling that economists and CEOs had forecast hasn’t materialized. On the contrary, the January jobs report shows an acceleration in hiring. The government also revised December’s report higher, bringing the two-month job gain to nearly 700,000.
“The dramatic upside surprise to both jobs and wage growth means that a March rate cut must be off the table now, and a May cut is also now potentially on ice,” said Shah.
The CEA’s Bernstein, in turn, noted that the Fed’s favored measure of inflation has fallen to a key point.
“If you look at the core PCE [personal consumption expenditures], it’s trending at 2% for the last six months of last year. So that is very consistent with the easing inflation story that we’ve been focused on here,” he said.
Still, advisers are keenly aware of higher grocery bills hurting the consumer’s psyche. Inflation rates may be slowing, but price levels are still higher today than before the inflation surge, something that until recently may account for poor sentiment and poll numbers for Biden.
Meanwhile, his likely GOP challenger in November, former President Donald Trump, has begun to test out his rebuttal to the recent run of strong economic news.
On Fox Business on Friday, he said the stock market is at record highs because investors “think I am going to get elected.”
He also downplayed a so-called soft landing in the economy, predicting a spike in oil prices because of unrest in the Middle East that he says could reignite inflation. He also said he would not reappoint Jerome Powell as Fed chief, saying if the central bank cuts interest rates, it will only be to help Democrats.

The suit, announced Feb. 23, accuses Boeing and Alaska Airlines of negligence for allegedly having ignored warning signs that could have prevented the Jan. 5 incident, which forced the plane pilots to make an emergency landing.
""This experience jeopardized the lives of the 174 passengers and six crew members that were on board,"" a release announcing the suit states. ""For those reasons, the lawsuit seeks substantial punitive damages ... for what was a preventable incident.""

Boeing 737 Max 9 planes flown by Alaska and United Airlines have resumed regular service. However, both carriers have indicated that they are reconsidering whether to place additional orders with Boeing for additional Max aircraft, including the successor line, the Max 10.

2024-02-02T13:51:00.533Z,"U.S. economy added 353,000 jobs in January, much better than expected",NBC News,"Job growth posted a surprise increase in January, demonstrating again that the U.S. labor market is solid and poised to support broader economic growth.
Nonfarm payrolls expanded by 353,000 for the month, much better than the Dow Jones estimate for 185,000, the Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday. The unemployment rate held at 3.7%, against the estimate for 3.8%.
Wage growth also showed strength, as average hourly earnings increased 0.6%, double the monthly estimate. On a year-over-year basis, wages jumped 4.5%, well above the 4.1% forecast. The wage gains came amid a decline in average hours worked, down to 34.1, or 0.2 hour lower.
Job growth was widespread on the month, led by professional and business services with 74,000. Other significant contributors included health care (70,000), retail trade (45,000), government (36,000), social assistance (30,000) and manufacturing (23,000).
The report also indicated that December’s job gains were much better than originally reported. The month posted a gain of 333,000, which was an upwards revision of 117,000 from the initial estimate. November also was revised higher, to 182,000, or 9,000 higher than the last estimate.
While the report demonstrated the resilience of the U.S. economy, it also could raise questions about how soon the Federal Reserve will be able to lower interest rates.
The January payrolls count comes with economists and policymakers closely watching employment figures for direction on the larger economy. Some high-profile layoffs recently have raised questions about the durability of what has been a powerful trend in hiring.
However, broader layoff numbers, such as the Labor Department’s report on initial jobless claims, show companies hesitant to part with workers in such a tight labor market.
Gross domestic product growth also has defied expectations.
The fourth quarter saw GDP increase at a strong 3.3% annualized pace, closing out a year in which the economy defied widespread predictions for a recession. Growth came even as the Federal Reserve further raised interest rates in its quest to bring down inflation.
The Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow tracker is pointing towards a 4.2% gain in the first quarter of 2024, albeit with limited data of where things are heading for the first three months of the year.
The economic, employment and inflation dynamics make for a complicated picture as the Fed seeks to ease monetary policy. Earlier this week, the Fed again held benchmark short-term borrowing costs steady and indicated that rate cuts could be ahead but not until inflation shows further signs of cooling.
Chair Jerome Powell indicated in his post-meeting news conference that the central bank does not have a “growth mandate” and said central bankers remain concerned about the impact that high inflation is having on consumers, particularly those on the lower end of the income scale.

This comes in the wake of a near-disaster that saw a door panel on an Alaska Airlines jet carrying 177 people blow out midair on Jan. 5. The airlines CEO, Ben Minicucci, said new, in-house inspections of the carrier’s Boeing 737 Max 9 planes following the incident revealed that “many” of the aircraft were found to have loose bolts.
The FAA temporarily grounded about 171 out of 218 Boeing 737 Max 9 airplanes used by U.S. airlines after the incident and announced an investigation into Boeing.
Since then, Alaska Airlines and United Airlines both confirmed plans to return their fleet of Boeing 737 Max 9 planes to service.
The FAA has already inspected existing Alaska and United Airlines jets and returned 93.75% — or 135 out of 144 of them — to service, according to FAA Deputy Associate Administrator for Aviation Safety Jodi Baker.
However, the administration is only three weeks into its increased oversight of the aircraft and ""it's too early to draw any conclusions,"" Baker said at the news briefing. The FAA ""will address concerns as they come up,"" she added.
“This is not new work, understanding how aircraft are manufactured, and we have the expertise to do that,” Baker said.
The FAA is focusing on hiring more employees to help with the oversight at the Boeing Renton Factory and streamline the data collection process.
Baker said the administration wants ""to step up more interaction and more direct observation of work that’s being accomplished"" at Boeing.
The administration expects the oversight process to take six weeks.

2024-03-13T10:00:00.000Z,"Laid-off tech workers turn to LinkedIn, therapy and one another to bounce back",NBC News,"More than a year out from the most brutal round of tech layoffs since the dot-com bubble burst, workers are reckoning with the loss of what some saw as airtight job security in an industry that’s still downsizing.
The tech industry recorded about 34,000 layoffs in January, the most in a single month since January 2023, when almost 90,000 people were let go, according to the job-loss tracker layoffs.fyi. While the latest cuts in Silicon Valley aren’t as deep as those early last year, tech remains one of the few soft spots in a strong labor market in which unemployment has held below 4% for over two years.
“There was a time when working in tech seemed like the most stable career you could have,” said Ayomi Samaraweera, who was laid off as chief of staff at the content creator platform Jellysmack in December 2022. After about 10 years in the industry, she said, “tech does not seem safe and secure.”
There was a time when working in tech seemed like the most stable career you could have.
Ayomi Samaraweera, founder of social app Canopy
That reality has been sinking in among workers in a field unaccustomed to extended periods of deep, widespread cuts. Many of those who lost their jobs over the past year or so have had mixed experiences bouncing back. Some have returned to the companies that laid them off, some are starting their own ventures, and some have left the industry. Others remain unemployed and are turning to one another for support.
Government data released last week showed overall layoffs declining across the economy, with one big exception: professional and business services, which includes many tech jobs. In January, layoffs in that broad category hit 446,000, the most in a month since January 2023, when over half a million people were laid off.
The cuts of the past year and a half follow a pandemic period of aggressive hiring, when tech companies benefiting from low interest rates poured money into projects that they’ve since tapped the brakes on. After it launched a big push for the metaverse, Facebook owner Meta, for example, has slashed jobs and steered more resources toward artificial intelligence.
The shift has caused some whiplash for workers who spent years at big-name tech firms, many of which have long boasted some of the most competitive pay and benefits on the planet. Across the U.S. economy, average hourly earnings broadly rose in 2023 from the year before, but pay for tech workers decreased. The industry’s average annual salary dipped to $111,193 last year from $111,348 in 2022, according to the tech career hub Dice.
Google slashed about 12,000 workers (about 6% of its workforce) last year, followed by more than 1,000 additional layoffs so far this year. The job losses were widespread, and many of the people cut were mid-career employees who in some cases had served for well over a decade — or over half of Google’s entire history.
“The biggest challenge people have in that group is they’ve not written a résumé in 15 years,” said Christopher Fong, an ex-Google employee who manages Xoogler, a community of other former Googlers, which doubled in size after last year’s layoffs. Fong said that Google has since rehired some of them but that the majority are still looking for full-time work.
As part of its support services, Xoogler offers psychotherapy coaching to boost members’ confidence throughout their job searches. One in-person gathering early last year featured a slideshow presentation that reminded attendees “most layoffs are not about performance” and said, “This was not your fault.”
Some laid-off tech workers have used the change in fortunes to strike out on their own. Samaraweera used her severance to go “all in” on her own startup, a social app called Canopy that she described as a “less chaotic version of Reddit.”
The software is in a pilot phase, and Samaraweera said the path ahead remains daunting now that a seemingly endless tide of money that once flooded into Silicon Valley has dwindled. As a tech startup owner in the current climate, she said, “I’ve been lean and frugal.”
Others aren’t ready to ditch corporate life yet, even if it means working outside the tech sector proper.
LinkedIn said the share of users in tech who marked themselves as “open to work” on its platform before starting roles in new industries rose to 65% early this year, up from 56.7% in April 2022.
With large tech employers like Cisco, PayPal and Microsoft still shedding employees in recent months, the share of “open to work” techies switching careers remains elevated, at 61.6% as of January, according to LinkedIn. The company said many workers leaving tech and media have opted for marketing, project management and sales roles in other fields.
The biggest challenge people have in that group is they’ve not written a résumé in 15 years.
Christopher Fong, manager of XOOGLER group for ex-google workers
Nolan Church, a recruiter who founded the talent marketplace Continuum, said the layoff “bloodbath” affected many tech industry workers in nontechnical roles — including fellow recruiters and human resources personnel.
Some of them, Church said, will “transition into software sales because they understand tech as an industry,” adding that laid-off techies are still in the “early innings” of any future career choices.
Others who’ve taken entrepreneurial routes are trying something completely different.
Ash Yao, a former DocuSign account executive who previously worked at Tesla, launched a decidedly non-tech company after she was laid off in the e-signature firm’s 10% workforce reduction last year, which came months after a 9% cut. She used her severance to launch Kace, a line of ready-to-drink teas now distributed nationwide.
Yao said that she’d always wanted to be an entrepreneur and saw her layoff as a “sign from the universe” to go for it.
She said the experience taught her to “use those skills you worked hard to gain to build for yourself,” adding, “When you’re working for a tech company, all those hard efforts are going into their brand.”

2024-02-22T14:40:12.204Z,More travelers risk booking hotel rooms on sites that tack on steep fees,NBC News,"Justin Perry was planning a one-night stay in London for early February and booked a room on what he thought was his chosen hotel’s website. It was only after getting a reservation confirmation that he realized he’d used a third-party platform — which charged him $155.92 in service fees on top of the $269.16 room rate.
“I was shocked,” said Perry, who considers himself a frequent traveler and has booked numerous trips on well-known platforms.
Perry, 49, a managing director for a financial services firm who lives in Boulder, Colorado, reserved the room on Jan. 31 after having searched for the hotel on his phone’s mobile browser. On the results page, he tapped a link that started with the hotel’s name and wound up on a page that he didn’t initially notice was operated by GuestReservations.com.
The booking process seemed straightforward, but the big, colorful “confirm reservation” button appeared above the full amount quoted for Perry’s stay, which appeared in less conspicuous text after scrolling to the bottom of the page.
The problem isn’t new, but it could pose headaches for spring breakers — many of whom are opening their wallets wider to book getaways this year. Nearly half expect to drop at least $1,000 on their travel plans, up from 34% last year, according to the travel platform Hopper.
“There are some online travel companies, or other travel agencies that do business online, that do not disclose this information clearly and who charge absolutely egregious fees,” said Henry Hartveldt, the president of Atmosphere Research Group, which analyzes the travel industry. That has been the case for at least the last 15 years, he added.
Government regulators, industry groups and consumer advocates have tried to push back against practices by third-party booking sites that draw frequent customer complaints.
Almost a quarter of travelers, 23%, reported having been misled by third-party resellers, translating to 28.5 million hotel stays worth around $5.2 billion, the American Hotel and Lodging Association found in a 2018 survey, the latest data available. Now, as travel volumes blow past pre-pandemic levels — a record 4.7 billion people are expected to travel this year — more consumers risk similar encounters.
Hartveldt noted that not all third-party booking platforms are unreliable or charge hidden fees. Bigger brands like Expedia and Booking.com are often reliable sources that partner with hotels and resorts to list their rooms. But there’s a plethora of lesser-known affiliate booking platforms, many of which work with larger ones to extend their reach.
That’s often where consumers can get tripped up, Hartveldt said. Some of the sites “design pages to look like they may be a hotel,” he said, “or they are using a hotel logo but displaying that perhaps in a disproportionately large size.”
Perry’s confusion didn’t end after he booked a room with Guest Reservations. The link on his receipt to manage his reservation took him to a different site called GetARoom.com, a platform that the travel industry giant Booking Holdings acquired in 2021 for about $1.2 billion, folding it under its Priceline subsidiary.
Perry called the number listed on his receipt, which he said “was just a customer service number — it doesn’t say where it’s going to — but when you get somebody, it’s GetARoom.com.” After about two hours of haggling, Perry said he was refunded the full service fee.
A spokesperson for GetARoom said it provides hotel inventory to booking platforms, including Guest Reservations, but isn’t involved in its customer experience or marketing. “In all instances, GetARoom complies with its legal requirements, takes its compliance obligations seriously and responds to investigations promptly and in accordance with the law,” she said.
A Guest Reservations spokesperson said the company is “committed to providing customers with an easy and transparent way to book stays at hotels worldwide. Similar to when booking directly through a hotel, customers are charged for applicable taxes, including any hotel taxes.”
“By charging a service fee on all reservations, we are able to offer 24/7 customer support and operate as an independent travel network,” the spokesperson said. “All fees, tax recovery charges, and terms are clearly displayed on the website.”
While the Federal Trade Commission is now in a rulemaking process to ban “junk fees” that raise the prices of hotel rooms and other consumer purchases, arrangements between large booking platforms and smaller affiliates are a long-standing part of the travel industry.
A key factor that can draw scrutiny from the FTC and consumer advocates is whether booking platforms (of any size) engage in deceptive advertising practices. Federal regulators have brought complaints against third-party booking sites on those grounds in the past.
The FTC has never filed a complaint against either Guest Reservations or GetARoom, but it did so in 2017 against another third-party booking platform called ReservationCounter.com and its parent companies, after consumers complained the site posed as the hotel websites they wanted to book on. The companies settled with the agency that year over allegations that they misled consumers with deceptive marketing.
Larger companies were supplying hotel room inventory to those websites through their affiliate programs, the FTC said, describing how the arrangements worked in its 2017 complaint. The smaller firms signed agreements with big platforms such as Expedia, Priceline and Orbitz to obtain inventory, the agency said, but “they advertise and market the available hotel rooms through their own advertisements, websites and call centers” in return for fees.
The Better Business Bureau frequently hears from consumers who mistake booking sites for hotels themselves, often because of the platforms’ advertising tactics, spokesperson Melanie McGovern said. “That’s a lot of the complaints we get about the third-party booking sites,” she said.
Many sites buy ad space appearing at the top of search results pages for key terms, she said. So consumers who want to book directly, rather than with third parties, should scroll past the sponsored ad results and look in the organic results that often appear beneath them. The BBB recommends always reviewing the terms and refund policies before you buy.
If you book with a third-party platform and get charged a surprise fee, the BBB advises calling the customer service line first. If you can’t get through, contact your credit card company to stop or dispute the charge, McGovern said. You can also file a complaint with the bureau.
“It’s really important, as consumers, that we do those checks — that we check with BBB, that we check with our friends and family — to make sure that a site is real before we put any kind of information in it,” McGovern said.

2024-03-07T14:15:43.635Z,Applebee's and IHOP are launching co-branded locations with both chains under one roof,NBC News,"Two of America’s iconic chain eateries are set to combine forces — literally.
The parent company of IHOP and Applebee’s has announced it has begun opening dual-branded locations, combining back-of-the house cooking areas and blending front-of-the-house dining areas, though with discrete entrances.
On parent Dine Brands Global’s most recent earnings call, CEO John Peyton said the company had already rolled out eight prototypes of the concept at select international locations, the most recent one opening in León, Mexico, about four hours northwest of Mexico City.
The idea is to reduce costs while maximizing revenues by attracting customers dining at different parts of the day to the same location, Peyton said.
“At breakfast, when there are more IHOP customers, customers can be seated in the Applebee’s area and vice versa at dinner,” Peyton told Nation's Restaurant News in a follow-up interview.
Peyton said the plan would be to “eventually” bring the concept of the U.S., without specifying a timetable.
Dine Brands, which also owns Fuzzy’s Taco Shop, has faced challenges in recent years amid changing tastes and rising cost pressures. It has closed hundreds of Applebee's locations since 2017, including 46 in 2023. Peyton also noted on the earnings call that customers continued to pull back on their spending last year.
Still, Dine Brands plans to open 25 new restaurants with Applebee’s largest operator, Flynn Restaurant Group. These will feature a more modern, streamlined restaurant that will include features like robotic beer dispensers.
As for IHOP, Peyton sees the brand as a market leader with a track record of growth, noting that 46 new U.S. locations opened last year.

2024-02-16T18:13:48.605Z,Target unveils new items costing $10 or less — and some under $1,NBC News,"As consumers continue to struggle with persistently high inflation, Target is unveiling a low-price, in-house brand it's calling dealworthy.
Target's dealworthy products will start at less than $1, with most items coming in under $10, the company said. The retailer is marketing some 400 items under the label, including apparel and accessories, essentials and beauty, electronics and home goods. As an example, Target said some electronics-related items, such as phone cases, would be priced 50%-lower than any other brands sold at Target.
The first dealworthy products have already begun arriving in stores and on Target.com. Additional products will be introduced throughout 2024 and early 2025, including power cords, underwear, socks, laundry detergent, dish soap and more, Target said.
Target is the latest major brand to recognize that consumers are balking at higher prices.
""We know that value is top of mind for consumers, and dealworthy, backed by our owned brand promise, will not only appeal to our current guests but position us to attract even more new shoppers to Target,"" said Rick Gomez, executive vice president and chief food, essentials and beauty officer at Target.
As with other Target-owned brand items, customers can return dealworthy products within one year with a receipt for an exchange or a refund.
Other retailers launching lower-cost in-house brands include Hanes, which recently unveiled ""M,"" a women's shapewear line priced as low as $5.50, which compares with signature brand Maidenform’s prices of $40 to $55. And as of August, supermarket chain Kroger's Smart Way brand, unveiled in 2022, is now the fastest-growing private consumer label on the market.
The rollout of dealworthy and the other lower-cost private labels comes as policymakers continue to wrestle with ongoing price pressures in the economy. Earlier this week, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported inflation data that came in above forecasts, raising fresh fears that the Federal Reserve will have to keep interest rates higher for longer to keep pressure on price growth.
And Friday morning, the BLS published additional data showing inflation remains hotter than expected.
""It is not surprising that businesses are raising prices in a new year after facing substantially rising labor costs over the previous year,"" Citibank analysts wrote in a note to clients Friday.

2024-02-13T19:07:22.549Z,"Paramount Global lays off about 800 employees, a day after announcing record Super Bowl ratings",NBC News,"Paramount Global is laying off hundreds of employees, just one day after the company announced CBS had record Super Bowl viewership, Chief Executive Officer Bob Bakish said Tuesday in an internal memo to employees.
Paramount will lay off about 800 people, or an estimated 3% of its workforce, according to a person familiar with the matter. Paramount Global ended 2022 with about 24,500 full-time and part-time employees.
Affected workers will be notified Tuesday, Bakish said in the note.
“These adjustments will help enable us to build on our momentum and execute our strategic vision for the year ahead — and I firmly believe we have much to be excited about,” Bakish wrote in the note.
Paramount shares fell about 4% in morning trading Tuesday.
Deadline first reported the number of cuts in January.
Paramount Global owns a variety of assets including CBS, Paramount Pictures, Pluto TV, Paramount+ and cable networks including Nickelodeon, BET and Comedy Central. The job cuts come as the media company considers merger and acquisition options. Paramount Global has held early merger talks with Skydance Media and Warner Bros. Discovery in recent months, CNBC has previously reported.
The media company had warned employees of impending cuts in a Jan. 25 internal memo. Bakish said at the time that Paramount Global needs to “operate as a leaner company and spend less.”
Its Paramount+ streaming service continues to lose money each quarter. The platform lost $238 million in the third quarter. The company reports fourth-quarter earnings Feb. 28.
Super Bowl 58 on CBS was the most-watched television show in history, with an estimated 123.4 million people having watched across all platforms.
CBS charged a record high average $6.5 million for every 30-second advertisement for the Super Bowl, according to the research company Guideline.
The network earned tens of millions in additional revenue because the game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco 49ers went into overtime.

2024-02-13T13:41:56.219Z,"Price growth continued to cool in January, but not as much as hoped for",NBC News,"U.S. price growth cooled in January, slowing from 3.4% to 3.1% on a 12-month basis, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Tuesday.
Excluding food and gas prices, ""core"" price growth was flat at 3.9% compared with December.
Yet while price growth continued to drift downward last month, the January data missed expectations for a more robust slowdown: Ahead of the report, economists surveyed were expecting a reading of 2.9%. They also expected a lower reading for the ""core"" reading, at 3.7%.
""The final mile towards the Fed’s 2% target was always going to be slow, erratic, and frustrating,"" wrote Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, in a note to clients following the report's release. ""Today’s data is not what markets or the Fed would have liked to see, but it’s important not to overreact and jump to the assumption that an inflationary resurgence is developing.""
The data showed an unexpected increase in shelter costs, which include rent and homeownership. These climbed more than 6% on a 12-month basis.
However, in a note to clients, Capital Economics research group's chief U.S. economist Paul Ashworth said such increases are unlikely to be sustained given more recent measures of rent growth.
""There is still plenty of disinflation in the economy,"" Ashworth wrote.
Still, Tuesday's report is another sign that elevated inflation continues to pervade parts of the U.S. economy.
While the pace of 12-month price increases has slowed from the near-double-digit highs reached in the summer of 2022, American consumers are still encountering higher prices compared with pre-pandemic prices.
With a few exceptions, economists agree that these higher price levels are most likely here to stay. Now, the question is how quickly price growth for consumer goods and services will continue to slow.
Still, consumers appear to be adjusting to a new normal of higher prices. NBC News recently covered how the cost of fast food — traditionally seen as a refuge from high-priced dining — has surged in the post-pandemic period.
“Eating at home has become more affordable,” McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski said in a call with analysts last week, noting that consumers making $45,000 or less per year were showing particular price sensitivity. “The battleground is certainly with that low-income consumer.”
After a massive surge amid the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, price growth for food at home has slowed dramatically — to just 1.3% on a 12-month basis in December.
By comparison, the price of food away from home has climbed, rising just above 5% on a 12-month basis in December.
Despite the recent divergence, the price of food in both categories has surged an identical 25% since the start of the pandemic. It's one reason it has taken so long for consumer confidence to rebound in the post-pandemic period and overall readings remain below pre-pandemic levels.
As for Tuesday's report, economists say that while it is likely to show marginal improvement toward the Federal Reserve's official target of 2% annual inflation, it looks like solid economic growth will keep the pace of price increases elevated.
""We continue to see the path back to 2-percent inflation as challenging, absent a more significant loosening in the labor and housing markets,"" economists with Citibank wrote in a note to clients Monday.
In other words, slower price growth could come at the cost of higher unemployment.
But absent a weakening labor market, price growth may be stuck above the 2% target, given wage and home price increases that remain elevated, the Citi analysts said.
If that is the case, lower interest rates may not begin to materialize until late spring or early summer. In his most recent remarks, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said he would need to see greater confidence that inflation was slowing meaningfully. Powell also indicated that an interest rate cut in March was highly unlikely.
After March, the next opportunity for the Fed to announce a rate cut would be May 1. But the Citi analysts say it might take one more meeting after that, in June, for the first rate cut to come.
Analysts at Bank of America also see June as the likeliest month for the first rate cut since the end of the pandemic. In a note to clients Monday, they said January's data will help Fed officials build a case for a rate cut in June but won't be decisive on its own.
Meanwhile, the chief political victim of higher inflation remains President Joe Biden. In the latest NBC News poll, Biden's chief Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump, held a 22-point advantage on the question of which presidential candidate would do a better job handling the economy, with 55% picking Trump and 33% choosing Biden.
A separate poll published last month by Harvard CAPS-Harris found that immigration had surpassed inflation as the chief concern among voters who were surveyed — but with inflation still ranking second.
Over the weekend, Biden called on corporations to curb the trend of ""shrinkflation,"" charging the same prices for lesser-sized goods. A report released by Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., found that household paper products were 34.9% more expensive per unit than they were in January 2019, with about 10.3% of the increase due to producers’ shrinking the sizes of rolls and packages.
As for how Trump would tackle inflation, liberal and conservative economists alike say some of his proposals — specifically adding foreign tariffs on imports and limiting immigration — could actually reignite it. Trump has also promised to replace Powell, whom he nominated when he was president in 2017, as Federal Reserve chairman, though only because, Trump said, he believed Powell would seek to ""help the Democrats"" by cutting interest rates in advance of the November 2024 election, a claim that is unfounded.
The Fed has historically sought to immunize itself from political pressures and didn't comment on Trump's remarks.

2024-02-02T16:43:57.742Z,Latest jobs report signals that interest rates are unlikely to drop anytime soon,NBC News,"Friday's blowout jobs report showing 353,000 jobs added in January versus expectations for 185,000 jobs is another signal that the U.S. economy remains strong.
But that good news also likely confirms the view of policymakers at the Federal Reserve that there is no rush to begin cutting interest rates, meaning the cost of borrowing for consumers — perhaps to buy a car or a house — will likely stay elevated for some time.
Earlier this week, the Fed announced it was leaving the current federal funds rate, which helps set interest rates for loans throughout the economy, unchanged at 5.25% to 5.5%.
In remarks after the announcement, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said he thought it was unlikely that the first rate cut of the post-pandemic period would come in March, as some investors were hoping. Inflation, he said, remains too hot — even at 3.4%. The central bank wants to get it back down to 2%.
“We are prepared to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for longer, if appropriate,” he said, referring to that 5.25% to 5.5% range.
In a note to clients after Friday's jobs report, Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said the data showed ""there is absolutely no sign of a softening labour market or weakening wage pressures,"" meaning that despite thousands of layoffs in industries such as tech and media recently, other job sectors are still going strong.
As a result, a March rate cut is off the table, Shah predicted, adding that a cut in May, when the Federal Open Markets Committee will deliver its third interest rate decision of the year, also now seems to be ""on ice.""
""Certainly, with this kind of number,"" she said, referring to Friday’s jobs report, ""the six or seven rate cuts that markets had been pricing in seems very offside.""
Following the release of Friday's jobs report, financial market traders increased their odds of the Fed maintaining its current rate through May from just 6% to 27%, while the odds of the current rate staying the same through March climbed from 62% to 80%.
The latest jobs data was not without some red flags for monetary policymakers. One of them is the acceleration in average hourly earnings with no corresponding change in hours worked.
If those trends continue, it could even be a sign of stagflation: higher prices but slower economic growth.
“This would be wonderful if inflation were at its target,"" Sean Snaith, a University of Central Florida economist, wrote in a note Friday. ""But now it means the current the Fed is swimming against just got stronger, and it’s going to be harder to get upstream,"" he said. While inflation has fallen dramatically since it peaked at 9.1% in June 2022, it has lingered stubbornly in the 3% range for the past seven months.
The jobs report also saw the continued trend in low survey response rates, as well as effects from severe winter weather, both of which may have skewed the numbers somewhat.
Still, the consensus among economic analysts is that higher interest rates are here to stay, for the time being.
""The much stronger than expected January jobs report, including upward revisions to job growth in previous months and a big increase in wages, makes a near-term cut in the fed funds rate less likely,"" Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC, wrote in a note to clients Friday.
Federal Open Markets ""Committee members will be concerned that strong job and wage growth in late 2023 and early 2024 could reignite inflationary pressures in the U.S. economy,"" he continued.
The upshot of it all: It is unlikely there will be a major change in borrowing rates anytime soon.

2024-02-21T18:11:22.056Z,Consumers are tired of price increases. Big brands are paying attention.,NBC News,"Until recently, Brooke Benson considered herself a Panera Bread loyalist. For the past 12 years, the 40-year-old Orlando, Florida, resident said she’d make three to four trips there every week — an estimate her husband said was closer to four or five — to get her favorite soups.
But after the outpost of the restaurant chain near Benson’s home raised its price to $8.79 for the same bowl of soup that had cost $7.09 three years ago, she said she was done.
“I actually have been looking at soup at all these different places and comparing the prices,” Benson said by text. “I can get better soup in larger portions for cheaper” elsewhere, she said.
Panera Bread didn’t respond to a request for comment, but several big brands are now acknowledging that inflation-weary Americans are walking away from products and services that keep getting costlier.
Many companies that raised prices during the recovery from the pandemic cited higher costs for the ingredients, materials and labor needed to provide goods and services that many consumers were racing to buy. Those price hikes, exacerbated by supply chain snags in late 2021, helped push the annual inflation rate to a four-decade high of more than 9% by summer 2022. It has since fallen to 3.1%, meaning prices overall are still going up, albeit more slowly.
That has put customers in a game of chicken with companies that continue to raise prices.
McDonald’s recently vowed to focus more on affordability this year, with CEO Chris Kempczinski saying in a recent earnings call that lower-income customers were forgoing the golden arches to eat more cheaply at home.
Baja Fresh and Wetzel’s Pretzels operator MTY Food Group said last week that same-store sales fell 0.9% yearly across its brands, after consumers responded to higher prices by reining in spending. CEO Eric Lefebvre said the company would be able to make only “very minimal price increases” as a result.
“We need to make sure we don’t push the customers away,” he said on an earnings call.
General Mills similarly cited “a continued challenging consumer landscape” as sales in its pet food businesses, including the Blue Buffalo brand, fell 4% on a yearly basis. The company admitted it had overestimated customers’ willingness to pay higher prices for dog treats.
“People [are] trading down to less expensive treats — if they’re still treating,” CEO Jeff Harmening told analysts in December.
Kraft Heinz, the maker of iconic mac-and-cheese and ketchup brands, reported a 7.1% decline in yearly sales, suggesting it was hitting the limit of how far it could hike prices before customers cut and run. The company raised prices by 2.5% across its product line over the course of 2023, after doing so by 14.2% the previous year. CFO Andre Maciel told analysts last week that Kraft expects to lift prices by only about 1% this year.
Home Depot said Tuesday it was planning for 2024 to be “a year of continued moderation,” as customers reduced their average spend by 1.3%. The company said shoppers are less excited about big-ticket purchases after a home-renovation frenzy early in the pandemic.
Some companies that have raised prices less aggressively over the past year were rewarded. After raising prices for its burgers by 7% in October 2022, Shake Shack increased them just 1% in October 2023. It said same-store sales jumped 2.8% over the course of the year, and traffic grew by 1.4%.
Walmart has been trying to lower some of its prices to cater to budget-conscious consumers, with clear results.
“We took our French bread back to $1, which had been $1 for a long time and went up as inflation hit the market,” Walmart U.S. CEO John Furner told investors Tuesday. The price had jumped to $1.47 before the cut. “We’re seeing results of that running about 40% over last year, so customers immediately responded,” Furner said.
He added that the retailer has sliced $1 off the price of rotisserie chickens as well.
Businesses’ wholesale costs for many raw materials, contracts with suppliers and other “inputs” are still elevated, with a closely watched index of those expenses recently posting its biggest increase in five months. That makes it unlikely consumers will see brands making deep price cuts across the board anytime soon, analysts say.
Even so, many companies are now more inclined to “swallow some of the cost increases” they’re shouldering, rather than pass them on to consumers completely, said John Zhang, a marketing professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School.
That’s already eating into profits for companies that sell essential and nonessential goods and services alike. To protect them, Zhang said, many brands are expanding the range of price points they offer shoppers. That could mean promoting higher-margin premium products for wealthier customers (such as the Double Big Mac) as well as stripped-down basics for more cost-conscious ones (like ad-supported Netflix).
“If you want to maintain your image, if you want your customer to still like you, you need to offer the customer more options,” he said.

2024-03-05T15:59:16.271Z,Target launches paid membership program as it chases new revenue streams,NBC News,"Target on Tuesday said it will launch a paid membership program next month, riffing off the playbook of its rivals Amazon and Walmart.
The subscription tier, Target Circle 360, will include unlimited free same-day delivery for orders over $35 in as little as one hour with no delivery fees and two free-day shipping, along with other perks.
The paid membership tier will launch in early April and cost $49 per year, said Cara Sylvester, Target’s chief guest experience officer. She announced the program at an investor event on Tuesday in New York City.
The retailer will also relaunch its free Target Circle loyalty program, which debuted in 2019, to make it easier to use and more personalized. For example, members who belong to the free program will have discounts automatically applied rather than having to scan through deals on the app, she said.
The big-box retailer is turning to the new revenue stream as it tries to boost weaker sales. Its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and revenue reported Tuesday beat Wall Street’s expectations, but its comparable sales have declined three quarters in a row.
With the move, Target is also following in the footsteps of retailers that have turned membership fees into a money maker and a sales driver. Amazon launched its Prime program in 2005, with perks like free two-day delivery and streaming of popular movies and original TV shows. It costs $139 per year or $14.99 per month, with the video membership-only option of $8.99 per month.
Walmart launched its program, called Walmart+, in 2020. It costs $98 per year or $12.95 per month, with perks like free shipping, free grocery deliveries for orders of at least $35 and gas discounts.
Target is turning to its competitors’ playbook for a reason: Walmart CEO Doug McMillon told investors on the company’s earnings call in February that Walmart+ members spend nearly twice as much as non-members and buy more over the course of a year.
Walmart has not said how many people subscribe to Walmart+, but its CFO John David Rainey said on the earnings call that its membership continues to grow by double-digit percentages.

2024-02-07T19:35:14.816Z,Fast foodies are getting fed up with price hikes at the drive-thru,NBC News,"Look no further than the fast-food drive-thru for evidence of inflation fatigue.
Food companies have been passing along higher labor and ingredient costs to consumers long after inflation peaked at 9.1% in June 2022. Diners are getting fed up, eating less fast food and griping on social media that their go-to cheap meals aren’t so cheap anymore.
Sales show it. McDonald’s reported underwhelming results in the fourth quarter, and Yum Brands showed weaker-than-expected growth in its top brands, which include KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut.
Fast-food executives are taking note. McDonald’s CEO Chris Kempczinski told analysts Monday that consumers are becoming more discriminating with their dollars, and he promised the company would focus more on affordability this year.
Kempczinski noted that consumers earning $45,000 or less annually were favoring comparatively cheaper groceries over Mickey D’s, opting to cook their own meals more often.
“Eating at home has become more affordable,” he said. “The battleground is certainly with that low-income consumer.”
Some common grocery items have been falling in price. In the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Consumer Price Index, the food at home category rose only 1.3% between December 2022 and December 2023, but food away from home rose 5.2%.
Long known for its Dollar Menu, McDonald’s was recently pilloried online for a Connecticut restaurant’s $18 Big Mac combo meals and $7 Egg McMuffin.
McDonald’s told NBC News that pricing is up to franchisees and can vary by location but that the company strives to strike a balance for value.
In recent years, many fast-food companies have expanded offerings and tweaked their restaurants to try to attract as many customers as possible across income levels. McDonald’s recently upgraded its famous burgers and opened a new concept called CosMc’s, all while leaning into nostalgia.
But inflation-scarred diners may care more about price, said Laura Murphy, managing director of Bolt PR who specializes in food and beverage marketing.
“People are really telling fast food QSR [quick-service restaurant] industry leaders, ‘This is what we’re looking for, this is what we want: We want efficiency. We want affordability.’”
Meanwhile, Taco Bell is leaning in on its value menu, promoting 10 items for $3 or less. The company told NBC News it “remains dedicated to offering our fans delicious food at affordable prices.”
This isn’t the first time in recent years that consumers have balked at menu price hikes, or taken to social media to gripe about them.
Yum CEO David Gibbs told Yahoo Finance last year that the company was planning more modest price increases than the ones it implemented in 2022. Amid the latest quarter’s disappointing results, Yum announced plans to juice sales at KFC by launching a smashed potato bowl and the chicken chain’s first loyalty program.
Some major food and beverage brands operating in the Middle East — including McDonald’s, Starbucks and Yum — have said conflict in the region and related boycotts have also dented business. Burger King’s parent company warned in November that the turmoil there threatened to pile on top of other global pressures, from the war in Ukraine to Covid-19, that have already driven up costs over the last few years.
That could potentially “have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations if we and our franchisees are not able to adjust prices sufficiently ... without negatively impacting consumer demand,” the company told investors.
Bucking the trend, Chipotle’s sales rose 8.4% in the fourth quarter and foot traffic improved, too, after a 3% menu price hike back in October. The company credited the return of carne asada with helping drive the growth.
With prices for almost everything higher today than three years ago, even though inflation has slowed sharply, Murphy said what matters most in today’s fast-food industry are cost and convenience.
“Let’s go back to really making sure that we’re providing simple food in an affordable way that’s efficient, quick, and it gives people really the basics of what they’re looking for,” she said.

No Sargento-branded products sold in traditional grocery stores were affected. The recall has been linked to one supplier, California-based Rizo-Lopez Foods Inc., that has also affected numerous other cheese brands.
Sargento released a statement saying its recall impacted ""a limited amount"" of its food service and ingredients products.
""On February 5, out of an abundance of caution, Sargento voluntarily recalled the products that were supplied by Rizo-Lopez Foods Inc. and products that were packaged on the same lines,"" it said. ""This recall did not impact Sargento-branded products. Sargento immediately terminated its relationship with Rizo-Lopez Foods Inc. and immediately notified our customers.""
According to the FDA, the wider Rizo-Lopez recall has resulted in 26 illnesses, including two deaths and 23 hospitalizations as of February 22.
According to information posted on the Food and Drug Administration's website, the Sargento-specific recall affects thousands of various cheeses distributed to Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, North Carolina, New Jersey, Nevada, Ohio, Rhode Island, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin.
The most heavily affected items were white cheddar cheese products, with 2,633 cases being recalled. These had best-by dates of between March and June 2024.
The recall was initiated Feb. 5.

2024-02-01T14:43:47.146Z,Disney’s streaming services have begun cracking down on password sharing,NBC News,"Disney has updated the language on its three streaming platforms to limit password sharing outside of a user’s individual account.
In an email to subscribers sent Wednesday, Disney-owned Hulu said it would begin limiting account sharing for prior and existing subscribers starting March 14, with the changes effective for new subscribers as of last week.
Disney+ and ESPN+ have also both updated their user agreements to reflect the changes to account sharing, though it was not immediately clear when those changes occurred. The new language was first reported by CNN.
A Disney representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Disney CEO Bob Iger hinted at the move to limit account sharing on a company earnings call last August.
“In calendar ’24, we’re going to get at this issue,” Iger said. “We certainly have established this as a real priority. We actually think that there’s an opportunity here to help us grow our business.”
An effort to cut down on users improperly sharing Disney+ accounts in particular helps to bolster Iger’s stated goal to make the streaming service profitable by the end of 2024.
The moves follow Netflix’s announcement last April that it would begin making users pay more if they wanted to share accounts. Netflix said last month it just saw its highest-ever quarterly subscriber growth.

2024-02-20T01:52:51.693Z,Capital One to acquire Discover Financial Services in $35.3 billion all-stock deal,NBC News,"Capital One Financial is set to acquire Discover Financial Services in a $35.3 billion all-stock deal.
Under the agreement, Discover shareholders would receive 1.0192 Capital One shares for each Discover share or about a 26% premium from Discover’s Friday closing price of $110.49. The companies said they expect the deal to close in late 2024 or early 2025, after which Capital One shareholders would hold 60% and Discover shareholders would own 40% of the combined company.
The merger of the two companies, which are among the largest credit card issuers in the U.S., would expand Capital One’s credit card offerings and its deposit base. The company bought digital concierge service Velocity Black, a premium credit card and luxury market platform, in June of last year.
The Wall Street Journal reported that Capital One, which already uses Visa and Mastercard networks, plans to keep the Discover brand.
“Discover has done a better job of bringing in a lot of deposits and [has] access to a lot of institutions to run the debit card network and provide service. So it gives them a lot of deposit gathering ability, which particularly in the current market is enormously important,” said David Schiff, West Monroe’s head of consumer retail and banking.
CNBC has reached out Capital One and Discover for comment.
There aren’t many parallels for similar acquisitions in the financial industry, meaning that the Capital One-Discover deal will likely have broad implications for merger activity within the sector, said Schiff.
“It’s a good example of the risk we’re seeing in the market, where the competing interests from regulators for increased control and rigor balance against the competitive demands that are being made quite clearly, in terms of the overall market,” Schiff said.
The deal comes amid a period of increasing pressure for Discover, including regulatory scrutiny and new leadership. The current CEO, Michael Rhodes, was announced in December 2023.
Shares of Discover are down 1.7% lower for the year, putting the company at a $27.63 billion market cap. Capital One has a market cap of $52.2 billion and shares of the company are up 4.6% in 2024.
Bloomberg News reported Monday that Capital One was considering the Discover acquisition.
The Capital One-Discover merger would be one of the largest deals announced so far this year. Synopsys announced a deal to buy Ansys for $35 billion in January and Diamondback Energy’s $26 billion deal to buy privately held oil and gas producer Endeavor Energy was announced on Feb. 12.

2024-03-08T21:13:49.751Z,Temple University reviewing reports of potential match-fixing of men's basketball game,NBC News,"Temple University said it was looking into reports of match fixing of a Division 1 men's basketball game.
In a statement Friday, a university representative said it was reviewing the March 7 game between the Temple University Owls and the University of Alabama-Birmingham Blazers at Temple's Liacouras Center arena in Philadelphia.
""We are aware of the media reports regarding last night’s men’s basketball game,"" it said. ""We will review the reports thoroughly in accordance with university and NCAA policies. While we can’t comment any further at this time, we take this matter very seriously.""
In the run-up to Thursday's 7 p.m. game, UAB opened as a 2.5-point favorite, according to Dave Connelly, a correspondent for betting group SportsGrid.
But the betting line surged to 8 points in favor of UAB within two hours of sportsbooks opening for the game, Connelly said, calling the upswing ""typically unheard of this late in the college basketball season without any meaningful news or injuries.""
UAB went on to win 100-72. Notably, UAB had 22 more rebounds than Temple — the Owls' worst rebounding performance since 2019.
A UAB rep told the Associated Press it was declining to comment.
The Blazers' record is now 19-11, compared with Owls' 11-19.
U.S. Integrity, a gambling watchdog group, flagged the game as unusual to U.S. casinos, according to Sports Illustrated reporter Pat Forde, citing a statement from an American Athletic Conference spokesperson.
The AAC declined to comment to NBC News beyond noting Temple's statement. A USI rep did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
There has not been a major gambling scandal in NCAA men's basketball since an incident involving Boston College and notorious mobster Henry Hill in the late 1970s.
However, the ongoing legalization of, and subsequent influx of interest in, online sports betting in recent years may have increased the likelihood for such an incident to occur again.
In a 2023 NCAA survey of athletic departments, 13% of Division 1 administrators said they had dealt with a gambling or sports wagering problem within the past year, compared with just 4% in 2019. The same survey found 30% of respondents saying they were now extremely or moderately concerned about sports wagering or gambling compared with other compliance issues, versus 20% saying so in 2019.
The report also anonymously quoted some administrators' profound concerns with the rise of digital gambling and its impact on students.
“Sports wagering is a billion-dollar industry with the resources to influence student athletes to gamble on a daily basis on every market front,"" one said. ""Institutions do not have the resources or the funding to win this battle.”
“The sheer access of wagering activities available with technology is IMPOSSIBLE to monitor or track,” another said.
A spokesperson for the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) said the organization could not comment on investigations.
""The NCAA takes sports betting very seriously and is committed to the protection of student-athlete well-being and the integrity of competition,"" the spokesperson said. ""The Association works with integrity monitoring services, state regulators and other stakeholders to conduct appropriate due diligence whenever suspicious reports are received. Due to the importance of confidentiality, the NCAA does not comment on current, pending or potential investigations.""

2024-03-06T19:34:38.559Z,'Absurd': NTSB chair blasts Boeing for failing to turn over records about midair blowout,NBC News,"Boeing has refused to tell investigators who worked on the door plug that later blew off a jetliner during flight in January, the chair of the National Transportation Safety Board said Wednesday.
The company also hasn’t provided documentation about a repair job that included removing and reinstalling the panel on the Boeing 737 Max 9 — or even whether Boeing kept records — Jennifer Homendy told a Senate committee.
“It’s absurd that two months later we don’t have that,” Homendy said. “Without that information, that raises concerns about quality assurance, quality management, safety management systems” at Boeing.
Lawmakers seemed stunned.
“That is utterly unacceptable,” said Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas.
Boeing did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., said she will ask Boeing to cooperate with the NTSB. Cantwell, who represents the state where Max jetliners are assembled, noted that the company is a leading U.S. exporter and major defense contractor.
“We need to get this right,” she said. “We need to help with the investigation so we can find out what in our system needs to be improved.”
Boeing has been under increasing scrutiny since the Jan. 5 incident in which a panel that plugged a space left for an extra emergency door blew off an Alaska Airlines Max 9. Pilots were able to land safely, and there were no injuries.
In a preliminary report last month, the NTSB said four bolts that help keep the door plug in place were missing after the panel was removed so workers could repair nearby damaged rivets last September. The rivet repairs were done by contractors working for Boeing supplier Spirit AeroSystems, but the NTSB still does not know who removed and replaced the door panel, Homendy said Wednesday.
Homendy said Boeing has a 25-member team led by a manager, but Boeing has declined repeated requests for their names so they can be interviewed by investigators. The manager of the team is on medical leave and unavailable, and security-camera footage that might have shown who removed the panel was erased and recorded over 30 days later, she said.
The Federal Aviation Administration recently gave Boeing 90 days to say how it will respond to quality-control issues raised by the agency and a panel of industry and government experts. The panel found problems in Boeing’s safety culture despite improvements made after two Max 8 jets crashed in 2018 and 2019, killing 346 people.

2024-02-01T18:56:25.906Z,Disney files appeal after federal judge dismissed its lawsuit against DeSantis,NBC News,"Disney filed an appeal Thursday of a federal judge's ruling that dismissed the company's lawsuit against Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and board members he appointed to manage a planning district Disney once operated in the state.
U.S. District Judge Allen Winsor on Wednesday tossed out Disney's lawsuit against DeSantis over the loss of a long-standing planning district, ruling that Disney lacked standing to bring the suit.
Winsor said Disney's claims of injury resulting from the appointment of board members to a new district created by Florida lawmakers was ""in the past.""
Disney also failed to show damages from specific actions the new board has taken or will take because of the governor’s alleged control of it, Winsor wrote.
""In fact, Disney has not alleged any specific injury from any board action,"" Winsor said.
Winsor was nominated by President Donald Trump in 2018 and was sworn in in 2019.
A Disney spokesperson said in a statement following the ruling:
“This is an important case with serious implications for the rule of law, and it will not end here. If left unchallenged, this would set a dangerous precedent and give license to states to weaponize their official powers to punish the expression of political viewpoints they disagree with. We are determined to press forward with our case.”
A spokesperson for DeSantis said in a statement:
""As stated by Governor DeSantis when he signed HB 9-B, the Corporate Kingdom is over. The days of Disney controlling its own government and being placed above the law are long gone. The federal court’s decision made it clear that Governor DeSantis was correct: Disney is still just one of many corporations in the state, and they do not have a right to their own special government. In short — as long predicted, case dismissed.""
The origins of the suit lie in the battle over the passage of a bill, which DeSantis signed into law in summer 2022, that limited discussion of gender and sexuality in schools. Dubbed the ""Don't Say Gay"" bill by opponents, the bill restricted teaching those subjects to fourth grade and above.
Former Disney CEO Bob Chapek came out against the bill following vocal opposition on social media from Disney employees.
In response, Florida state lawmakers began taking steps to dismantle what was then known as Disney's Reedy Creek Improvement District, the planning area it had maintained de facto control over since the late-1960s. That control allowed the company to make building and infrastructure changes in and around Walt Disney World.
Last February, the Legislature effectively stripped away Disney's control over Reedy Creek, renaming it the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District and appointing five officials backed by DeSantis to serve on a newly created board.
Disney sued, claiming DeSantis and the Legislature had dissolved Reedy Creek in retaliation for and in violation of the company's First Amendment rights. It alleged in a separate lawsuit that the new Oversight District was failing to properly preserve records.
In December, The Associated Press reported that about 50 out of 370 employees had left the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District since it its takeover, ""raising concerns that decades of institutional knowledge are departing with them, along with a reputation for a well-run government.""
CORRECTION (Jan. 31, 2024, 5:40 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated what grades are covered by the law limiting discussion of gender and sexuality in schools. It restricts teaching those subjects to fourth grade and above, not third grade. It also misstated the court the judge serves on. He is a U.S. district judge, not a state judge.

2024-02-07T23:36:13.431Z,New sports bundle could give cord-cutting fans their biggest single source of content yet,NBC News,"Disney, Fox and Warner Bros. Discovery announced plans Tuesday to launch a streaming service that could become the biggest single source of sports content for cord-cutting consumers.
The three companies account for a massive share of the TV sports market, carrying games that are virtually all available online — but often accessible only with subscriptions to pricier traditional cable and satellite services.
Starting this fall, the new package could sidestep those subscriptions and deal another crushing blow to traditional TV providers.
""This is obviously a nice, positive step for fans,"" media industry analyst Rich Greenfield, a co-founder of LightShed Partners, told CNBC.
""It's going to make it a little bit easier to access just the content they want if they don't care about a lot of the non-sports cable networks out there,"" he said.
The new sports package adds one more potential cost for cord-cutters who might already be running up big digital TV bills with other providers, such as Netflix, Prime Video and Peacock. However, subscribers would have the ability to bundle the new sports offering with the companies’ streaming platforms, Disney+, Hulu and Max, according to CNBC.
The new Disney/Fox/Warner package was unveiled just ahead of Wednesday's announcement by Disney that ESPN will launch its own flagship direct-to-consumer service in 2025, adding one more overlapping sports option for consumers.
Lachlan Murdoch, the chief executive at Fox, told analysts Wednesday that the new streaming platform will target millions of “cord-nevers,” mostly young adults who have never subscribed to traditional cable.
Disney carries virtually every sport under the sun, with massive investments in the NFL, the NBA and college football and basketball. Those channels are ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNU, the SEC Network, the ACC Network, ESPNEWS and ABC.
Fox, via its own Fox Network, FS1, FS2 and the Big Ten Network, carries Major League Baseball, the NFL and some college sports. Warner Bros.' TNT and TBS carry the NBA and the NHL.
The new bundle conspicuously does not include NBC and Paramount's CBS. NBC carries ""Sunday Night Football,"" some college football, golf, auto racing, horse racing and the English Premier League in soccer.
CBS has the NFL, golf and some European soccer.
Sports carried by major providers like NBC and CBS are not part of the new offering. So any sports fans thinking about dumping their traditional cable providers would have to weigh all of the Disney, Fox and Warner Bros. sports against the loss of NBC content such as ""Sunday Night Football"" or CBS material, such as AFC action.
""It's clearly not a good thing for companies like Paramount who are not being included in this,"" said Greenfield, who estimated the new service could cost $30 to $40 a month. ""It's not good for NBC, although obviously within the size and scale of Comcast, I think it's less of a negative than it probably is for Paramount.""
The price would make the new offering competitive with YouTube TV, which has become an alternative for sports fans who don't want to pay for cable and costs $72.99 per month.
A representative for NBC Sports declined to comment Wednesday, while a spokesperson for CBS could not immediately be reached for comment.
""This is a huge move; that's a lot of sports in your pocket,"" said University of Nevada, Las Vegas, sociology professor Michael Borer, who specializes in popular culture. ""There's this whole movement of being able to watch a game wherever you go.""
Some leagues carry their own digital offerings, which often black out local games.
Baseball fans with a singular focus on the diamond could buy MLB.TV, which cost $150 last season. The NBA League Pass can be purchased by hoops-centric consumers, for the second half of this season, for $50.
The move to digital offerings took a big step in late 2022 when the NFL sold its ""Sunday Ticket"" package, which brings games not shown on local Fox and CBS affiliates to YouTube for $2 billion after it had long been on satellite.
The base price for football fans who bought their 2023 ""Sunday Ticket"" packages early was $249.
The new Disney/Fox/Warner Bros. bundle would presumably not include Fox games not shown in viewers' local markets.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 524.63 points, or 1.35%, for its worst session since March 2023 on a percentage basis. At its lows, the 30-stock index sunk 757.52 points, or 1.95%. The S&P 500 slid 1.37%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.8%.
The Russell 2000 also suffered, tumbling nearly 4% for its worst session since June 2022.
The consumer price index rose 0.3% in January from December. CPI was up 3.1% on an annual basis. Economists polled by Dow Jones expected CPI to have increased by 0.2% month over month in January and 2.9% from a year earlier.
Core prices, which exclude volatile food and energy components, rose 0.4% month over month and 3.9% from a year ago. Core CPI was expected to have increased 0.3% in January and 3.7% from a year earlier, respectively.
“This may well come as a easy excuse to take some of the froth out of the top of this market that’s been universally higher thus far this year,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Financial. “The CPI was, as reported today, just a touch hotter than expectations and proof positive that we’re not on a linear path, but we’re on a path headed lower.”
The 2-year Treasury yield jumped above 4.63%, and the 10-year yield topped 4.29% following the CPI data. Tech shares including Microsoft and Amazon, which have steered the market run to record highs as rates declined, led the losses in trading Tuesday. Microsoft slid 2.2%, while Amazon fell 2.1%.
In corporate news, JetBlue Airways spiked 20% after activist investor Carl Icahn reported a nearly 10% stake in the airline. Toymaker Hasbro lost 3% after missing analyst expectations for the fourth quarter. Shares of Avis Budget Group slipped 22% on the back of disappointing fourth-quarter revenue.

The platform had allowed cameras in common areas like hallways and living rooms as long as they were clearly mentioned in a property's listings.
Those will now be banned, too.
“Our goal was to create new, clear rules that provide our community with greater clarity about what to expect on Airbnb,"" Juniper Downs, Airbnb’s head of community policy and partnerships, said in a release. ""These changes were made in consultation with our guests, Hosts and privacy experts, and we’ll continue to seek feedback to help ensure our policies work for our global community.”
Airbnb said the new rules would be likely to affect only a ""smaller subset"" of listings given that most properties don't have cameras.
The company is also revising its rules about outdoor security cameras and other devices, like noise decibel monitors. All of them must now be disclosed in property listings.
The privacy advocacy group Surveillance Technology Oversight Project praised the move.
“No one should have to worry about being recorded in a rental, whether the bedroom, the living room, or a hall,” Executive Director Albert Fox Cahn said in a release. “Getting rid of these cameras is a clear win for privacy and safety, and we know that these recording devices are ripe for abuse.""
Airbnb shares have nearly doubled after they hit a low in December 2022 amid still-healthy demand, though the company also has announced stock purchases that cause the price to go up. Even as there were a record 99 million bookings in its most recent quarter, Airbnb said in a release that it is looking to ""reinvent"" itself over the next several years.
“I think that Airbnb can go far beyond travel in the coming years, but I think we’re going to start with our core,"" CEO Brian Chesky said, according to The Financial Times. ""We’ll start with travel, and then down the road we can move beyond travel.""

2024-03-09T12:42:40.000Z,"Aviation incidents seem to be proliferating, but experts say there's no reason for alarm",NBC News,"A flying tire. A runway roll-off. Multiple emergency landings.
It may seem like mishaps involving planes have been growing in frequency. But experts say there is no cause for major alarm, as the aviation industry’s safety record remains better than it’s ever been when measured by lives lost.
“This is not a safety trend,” said John Cox, a pilot and the president and CEO of Safety Operating Systems LLC, of the recent spate of high-profile incidents.
According to the aviation industry publication FlightGlobal, there were just six recorded fatal commercial aviation accidents worldwide in 2023, resulting in 115 deaths — the fewest on record.
National Transportation Safety Board data confirms the downward trend: Compared with 27 major accidents involving large U.S. carriers in 2008, there were just 20 in 2022, the most recent year for which data is available.
The rate of accidents involving injury or death to a passenger or substantial damage to a plane has also declined — from 0.141 per 100,000 flight hours to 0.112 in 2022.
In other words, the data shows flying has rarely been safer.
“There’s not anything unusual about the recent spate of incidents — these kinds of things happen every day in the industry,” said Jeff  Guzzetti, a pilot and the president of Guzzetti Aviation Risk Discovery LLC.
Still, the flying public is now especially attuned to such reports — perhaps most notably because of January’s midair blowout incident on an Alaska Airlines flight involving a Boeing 737 Max 9 jet.
Among the latest high-profile events: On Friday, a United Airlines flight on a Boeing 737-800 rolled off the runway in Houston while taxiing to its gate. No one was injured. United noted the plane was operating in rainy conditions at the time.
On Thursday, a tire fell off a United Airlines flight on a Boeing 777-200 that had just taken off from San Francisco, forcing an emergency landing at Los Angeles International Airport. No one was injured in that incident either. Cox told The Associated Press tire incidents are usually a maintenance issue and not linked to the manufacturer. United said the plane, built in 2002, was designed to land safely without all tires in operation.
On Monday, a United Airlines flight on a Boeing 737-900 from Houston to Fort Myers, Florida, had to make an emergency landing after flames started shooting out of the engine. United said in a statement that it appeared bubble wrap entered the airfield and was ingested by the plane’s engine.
The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating these incidents.
The NTSB also revealed this week it was investigating a United flight on a Boeing 737 Max in February that had potentially faulty rudder pedals.
In a statement, United said it is also looking at each of the incidents, though they all appear to be unique.
“Each of these events is distinct and unrelated to one another,” the airline said. “Safety is our top priority, and we’ll continue to do everything we can to keep our customers and employees safe.”
Boeing also said it was assisting with investigations of the incidents.
Experts pointed out that each incident is unique and may not be related to United or Boeing. Even as he acknowledged the commonality of United and Boeing as the players in each of these incidents, Guzzetti said such cases were still fairly common in the regular course of flying.
“If you look at the big picture, there hasn’t been an increase in the number of incidents,” Guzzetti said. “There’s just a lot of scrutiny now because of the door-plug event, so you have a jittery public and the news media picking up all these things.”
Because consumers can use their phone cameras to immediately broadcast these mishaps over vast social media networks as they happen, that makes the public more aware of them, even if their frequency has not actually increased, Cox said.
Still, while experts say there is little cause for alarm, they acknowledge a crucial part of the air travel industry has changed in recent years — namely, that aviation personnel on average now have less experience than previous generations of pilots and maintenance crews.
“I think it’s a possibility that the lack of super-experienced and qualified pilots and mechanics could play a role in decreasing aviation safety,” Guzzetti said. “But it’s hard to quantify. I don’t think the decrease is alarming — you can’t quantify that — or even correlate it. But it’s worthy of consideration.”
Another factor that could be at play is newer airplanes. In fact, older planes were in some ways easier to manage because they were less technologically sophisticated, experts say.
But newer planes have more automatic or computerized features that may make flying easier for a pilot, but which are harder to deal with when something goes wrong.
“The evolution of airplanes is requiring changes in how we train  pilots, where there’s a focus not only on understanding the systems of an airplane, but also managing that automation while keeping manual flying skills sharp,” said Cox.
Yet the reduced accident count is proof that, overall, these newer planes have made flying safer, he said.
Boeing and its 737 Max line of planes remain under investigation by the NTSB in the wake of the January blowout incident. Earlier this week, NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy blasted Boeing for failing to turn over information related to its 737 Max manufacturing process; a day later, Boeing provided the names of 737 Max employees, according to Reuters.
The news wire service also reported the NTSB now plans to hold a multiple-day investigative hearing into the Max 9, likely in late summer.

2024-02-27T22:29:57.948Z,"The IRS's new, free 'Direct File' service for simple tax returns is now available in 12 states",NBC News,"The IRS's new, free filing software for relatively simple tax returns is now available in 12 states.
The Direct File service, which is being piloted for the first time for  2023 tax-year returns, is now being offered to qualified filers in Arizona, California, Florida, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington and Wyoming.
To qualify for Direct File, you have to have a Social Security number or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number for yourself and any spouse or dependents you claim. You also need a current driver’s license, state identification card, U.S. passport or passport card.
There are some limitations to the tax-filing service. Only people who are W-2 employees and those who receive Social Security or unemployment income can use Direct File. Other types of income, like capital gains, rental income or money from payment apps and online marketplaces, can’t be reported with Direct File.
IRS Direct File can be accessed on a mobile device and it's also available in Spanish.
Taxpayers who use the service can only take the standard deduction — the set dollar amount that reduces your taxable income — and does not allow for itemized deductions. The IRS estimates that about 9 in 10 filers take the standard deduction.
The standard deduction for the 2023 tax year is:
And people who are 65 and older or blind get the standard deduction plus these additional deductions:
The software that powers Direct File also lets taxpayers in five of the pilot states — Arizona, California, Massachusetts, New York and Washington — transfer their federal tax information to their respective state’s online tax tool for state income tax filing.
Direct File is one of many provisions enacted through the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which allocated $80 billion in additional funding to the IRS.
Filing companies like Intuit and H&R Block have spent millions over the years to prevent the rollout of such a product, and have criticized the program as a ""solution in search of a problem.""
However, Eddie Hartwig, partner at consultancy Service Design Collective and former deputy administrator at the United States Digital Service, said millions of taxpayers, especially lower-income people, can inadvertently leave money on the table by not filing a return, in part by missing out on things like the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and Child Tax Credit, which could reduce your tax liability and potentially increase your refund.
Direct File, Hartwig said, could help resolve this by making it easier for eligible individuals to file.
""We know that there are 5 million EITC applicants not applying, who could get money but are not filing their taxes and not getting money,"" Hartwig said in an interview. ""And there are 7 million Child Tax Credit folks in the same position ... So there are millions of people for whom this would make a big difference in incomes.""
CORRECTION (Feb. 28, 2024, 11:09 a.m. ET): A previous version of this article mischaracterized the tax credit implications of using certain tax-filing programs, like H&R Block and Intuit (TurboTax). Taxpayers will not miss out on such credits by using the programs. The reference has been removed.

2024-03-13T22:40:16.067Z,"Boeing, Alaska Airlines point fingers at each other in lawsuit over door plug blowout",NBC News,"Boeing and Alaska Airlines have separately denied any legal responsibility for the injuries allegedly caused to dozens of passengers after a door plug blew out of a 737-Max 9 jet during a flight in January.
In its formal answers this week to a class-action lawsuit brought by dozens of passengers of Alaska Airlines Flight 1282, Boeing generally acknowledged the preliminary findings of a National Transportation Safety Board investigation that determined the door plug was improperly installed. The company also acknowledged that, in an interview with CNBC, Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun publicly described the incident as “our mistake.”
But Boeing denied liability for any damages alleged by the passengers, saying their lawsuit should be dismissed. The company also contended it cannot be held responsible for any injuries that may have resulted because its products were “improperly maintained, or misused by persons and/or entities other than Boeing.”
Likewise, Alaska Airlines denied liability, claiming that any injuries stemming from the door plug blowout “were caused by the fault of persons or entities over whom Alaska Airlines has no control … including Defendant The Boeing Company and/or non-party Spirit AeroSystems.”
Alaska Airlines also denied that the activation of the plane’s cabin-pressure warning light three times within the previous month — including on the day before the door incident —  was related or meant that the plane was unsafe to fly.
The legal filings, submitted as part of the case in the U.S. District Court in Seattle, represent the first formal response from the companies to any of the several lawsuits filed in the wake of the Jan. 5 incident.
Daniel Laurence, an attorney representing passengers who are part of the class action, said Wednesday he was “frankly surprised” that Boeing and Alaska Airlines “don’t want to simply admit liability and put this case behind them.”
“They’re putting up a wall and circling the wagons,” added Laurence, with the Strimatter Kessler Koehler Moore law firm in Seattle. “That’s disappointing, given what I think most of the population believes and the evidence appears to clearly support — that they put this aircraft into the air with an unsecured door plug that, had it come out a few minutes later, would have killed everybody on board.”
The incident occurred shortly after the Boeing-manufactured jet, carrying 171 passengers and six flight crew members, took off from Portland International Airport bound for Ontario International Airport in San Bernardino County, California. After reaching an altitude of about 16,000 feet, the door plug blew out, leaving a large hole in the plane’s fuselage and forcing the plane to turn back to Portland, where it landed safely.
Following the incident, which has brought new scrutiny to Boeing and its troubled 737 Max airplanes, the Federal Aviation Administration temporarily grounded some models of the plane. The NTSB investigation preliminarily found no bolts had been installed to secure the plug.
The FAA separately launched an audit into Boeing and its supplier, Spirit AeroSystems, finding “multiple instances where the companies allegedly failed to comply with manufacturing quality control requirements.” The Department of Justice has also separately opened a criminal probe into the door plug blowout, according to a source familiar with the investigation.
In the wake of the incident, at least three separate lawsuits have been filed by Flight 1282 passengers and their spouses, including cases in state courts in Washington and Oregon.
Passengers involved in the federal lawsuit, seeking class-action status, claim they were physically injured and traumatized by the door plug’s blowout, which caused rapid depressurization of the plane’s cabin and led to widespread panic.
“The pressure change made ears bleed and combined with low oxygen, loud wind noise and traumatic stress made heads ache severely,” the lawsuit states. “Passengers were shocked, terrorized and confused, thrust into a waking nightmare, hoping they would live long enough to walk the earth again.”
Since the incident, some passengers have avoided flying on any airplane, and some have sought counseling to deal with emotional trauma, Laurence said.
The lawsuit also alleges that several passengers had trouble breathing in the aftermath of the door plug blowout because oxygen masks that dropped during the incident weren’t functioning.
Alaska Airlines denied that any oxygen masks did not work in its filing this week.
The airline acknowledged that the jet’s auto cabin pressure controller light had activated three times before the door plug blowout, leading Alaska Airlines to restrict the plane from flying on long routes over water. But the airline disputed that the light warnings “made the aircraft unsafe to fly (and) denies any correlation between the pressurization controller warning light activations and the door plug accident on Flight 1282,” its filing says.

2024-02-25T12:00:41.000Z,Welcome to the housing market’s new normal — 7% mortgage rates and all,NBC News,"Mortgage rates are high and housing inventory is tight, but some experts see the market’s deep freeze starting to thaw this spring.
Homebuying started to pick up during and after the holidays. Existing home sales increased 3.1% from December to January, according to the National Association of Realtors. Meanwhile, the inventory of unsold existing homes rose 2% from December to January, totaling around 1 million at the end of last month, slightly expanding buyers’ options.
“While home sales remain sizably lower than a couple of years ago, January’s monthly gain is the start of more supply and demand,” NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said in a news release Thursday.
“Buyers have a few more choices available than last year,” Zillow Chief Economist Skylar Olsen wrote in a recent blog post. After a series of “unimpressive Januaries the last few years,” last month’s uptick in inventory is still relatively modest, she said. But Olsen forecasts “a competitive home shopping season come spring” nonetheless.
For the last few years, limited housing inventory and low rates have put the housing market on ice. Many homeowners who’d otherwise be eager to sell have hesitated to shake off the so-called golden handcuffs of mortgage rates as low as 2% or 3%.
That’s finally starting to change, experts say — even though rates are now much higher, climbing again past 7% in recent weeks.
“Markets are just kind of recalibrating for the reality that the Fed is not going to cut interest rates right away,” said Greg McBride, Bankrate’s chief financial analyst. For many buyers and sellers alike, it’s beginning to sink in that “we’re not going back to three and four percent mortgage rates” anytime soon, he said.
In many cases, lifestyle factors — like empty-nesters looking to downsize or growing families hunting for more space — are pushing people to move, rather than wait around for sweeter deals.
“It’s a new cycle for real estate,” said Bess Freedman, CEO of Brown Harris Stevens, a real estate agency that operates throughout the East Coast. Already, she said, that shift in mindset has started to put some more “good opportunities out there. The people who are serious about it are getting into the market and taking advantage of it.”
Experts expect buyers to have a bit more leverage this year compared to last. Data from Zillow shows that 1 in 5 home listings saw a price cut in January, and the typical home was on the market for 29 days — longer than during last year’s buying frenzy, but 19 days shorter than the average before the pandemic.
You don’t need to feel pressed into making an offer on the spot.
Bankrate chief financial analyst Greg McBride
“We’ll probably see several years of pretty tepid home price appreciation,” McBride said.
That could benefit those who are still browsing and saving up for a first home, he said. “If you get that promotion, you pay off your student loan debt, you really build up your savings, you’re going to be in a position where home prices may not be much different two years from now than they are today. But your financial position is a lot better,” McBride said.
Buyers should take the time now to improve their credit and get pre-approved for a loan. Freedman also cautions against waiting for lower rates if you can afford to buy. If you happen to find something you love, she said, “you can probably negotiate well and get your financing in place, and you won’t regret it.”
With supply increasing, buyers stand to benefit from a little more time in the process than in years past, when countless buyers were waiving inspections and bidding well over asking prices just to be in the running.
Right now, “you have the ability to do appropriate due diligence. You don’t need to feel pressed into making an offer on the spot, and if you do, that’s a pretty good indicator that maybe you should walk away,” McBride said. “Making the biggest financial decision of your life under duress rarely leads to success.”
Sellers may increasingly find they need to work with an agent who’s tapped into local trends to avoid having their homes sit on the market for a long time, Freedman said.
“If you’re priced right, it’s definitely a seller’s market. If you’re priced too high, you’re just going to sit there,” she said.
If a home you’re trying to sell is languishing but you can’t reduce the asking price, McBride recommends dangling other concessions. “Offering a temporary mortgage rate buy-down for the seller could be the type of incentive that gets a deal,” he said.
CORRECTION (March 11, 2024, 3:20 p.m. ET): An earlier version of this article quoted from an outdated Zillow forecast for a modestly improving spring home shopping season. A more recent Zillow analysis in February projected a “competitive” spring market.

2024-02-20T17:27:41.710Z,American Airlines raises bag fee by $10 for luggage checked at the airport,NBC News,"If you're checking a bag for an American Airlines flight, expect to pay more.
The carrier has announced it is raising its checked bag fee by $10, from $30 to $40, for bags checked at the airport. For luggage checked online through American's website, the fee is increasing from $30 to $35.
For a second checked bag, the fee is rising from $40 to $45, whether purchased online or at the airport.
By comparison, a passenger's first checked bag on Delta and United still costs $30, while second ones cost $40 to $50.
It's the first time since 2018 that American has increased its checked bag fee.
The changes, and others, were announced Tuesday as part of an effort to nudge passengers to become American Airlines AAdvantage status members. Customers who sign up will continue to receive complimentary bags on American Airlines flights, the carrier said. And most customers who have an AAdvantage credit card will get their first eligible checked bag free on domestic American Airlines itineraries. Customers who buy a ticket for a premium cabin on a domestic or international flight can still check their bags for free.
“Not only does booking directly with American provide the best possible experience, it’s also where we offer the best fares and it’s most rewarding for our AAdvantage members,” Vasu Raja, American’s chief commercial officer, said in a statement.
A full list of new changes for AAdvantage members can be found here.
American is also changing its fee structure for checked items that are overweight.
For bags that exceed the 50-pound limit by just 3 pounds, the fee will be $30, down from $100. The same fee will apply to items 3 inches larger than the 62-inch limit.
For items that are both oversized and overweight up to 70 pounds, the fee will be capped at $200. Fees for items that are up to 100 pounds will be capped at $450.
Last month, American posted a $19 million profit for the last three months of 2023, topping Wall Street estimates.

2024-02-01T13:00:41.000Z,Higher tax filing costs could take a bite out of your refund,NBC News,"Taxpayers are facing higher costs to file their returns this year. Some will find relief from a new government tool. Many won’t.
The costs of tax return preparation and other accounting fees rose 8.3% — steeper than the current 3.4% inflation rate — between November 2023 and the same month the year before, the latest federal data show. That category reflects the growing costs of using DIY tax software and of hiring an accountant.
Many tax preparation firms, like other employers, have had to offer higher pay to attract workers in an industry short on accountants as fewer college students pursue accounting degrees.
“A lot of older preparers are retiring [and] the client base is expanding, so we need to hire more staff,” said Atiya Brown, a certified public accountant and owner of Dallas, Texas-based The Savvy Accountant. She estimates she and her peers have raised prices by 7% to 12% to offset higher costs for labor and software.
The average cost for filing an individual return rose to $248 in 2023 from $213 in 2021, a study released in August by the National Association of Tax Professionals shows, basically in line with government data tracking price increases for these services.
It isn’t unusual for preparers to raise rates, though the impact on consumers can vary widely; some accountants charge a fixed hourly rate, while others set a minimum fee with added costs for more complex returns.
The NATP survey found 49% of tax professionals increase prices annually. About 37% of those who hiked their rates did so mainly to “stop giving away as much free work,” with 16% saying they were “at capacity and need to slow on-boarding of new clients.”
Some of the most popular DIY filing tools are getting more expensive, too.
H&R Block’s desktop software options this year range from $25 for preparing “basic” returns to $75 for its “premium” offerings, like those capable of handling taxes on rental property. Those two are up by $5 and $10, respectively, since last year. Later this tax filing season, prices across all of its plans will rise by another $10.
“We delayed it as long as we could,” an H&R Block spokesperson said, citing higher costs for distribution and development, adding that this year is the company’s first price increase in over a decade.
TurboTax has kept its pricing unchanged from a year ago, but that will only last a few more weeks.
Its desktop software tools, which range from $40 for filing “basic” returns to $105 for “premier” offerings, remain above H&R Block’s pricing. And they’ll also be going up by $10 later this tax season — a common practice that both companies typically advertise prominently, looking to lure customers to file early.
Both H&R Block and TurboTax offer free online filing services for simple returns. But itemized deductions and slightly more complicated tax situations often require paying for upgraded features. And as many tax filers are reminded each year, both companies’ “basic” software options cover only federal taxes, with state filings tacking on another $40 apiece.
Alex Knight, 44, turned to a “free” option to file his taxes last year, only to find the charges adding up to more than $140 for including taxes on an investment account.
“It was just so esoteric and bizarre,” he said, “having all these materials, investing all the time, and, ‘Oh, by the way, this is going to cost you money.’”
Knight, who lives in a Brooklyn, New York, and works at an streaming audio company, said he’s just going to hire an accountant this year, his first time filing jointly with his wife. He expects to pay around $300 to $350.
“It’s frustrating, too, that this is something you have to go through a private company to do,” he added.
The government hopes to change that. The Internal Revenue Service is now offering Direct File, a new option allowing many taxpayers to file straightforward federal returns for free.
It’s launching this year as a pilot program in a dozen states — Arizona, California, Florida, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington and Wyoming — and will roll out incrementally through mid-March. Many eligible taxpayers will be able to use Direct File to submit state taxes for free, too.
In Arizona, for example, full-time residents with simple returns — largely those with common income sources and limited claims like the child tax credit — can use Direct File to file both their state and federal returns at no cost, said Rebecca Wilder, a communications director for the Arizona Department of Revenue.
“We’re always looking for ways to make filing taxes easier and more seamless, and so it just made sense for us to jump onto a pilot program that was already underway,” Wilder said, adding that Arizona hopes to expand eligibility to other types of taxpayers.
The IRS already offers Free File, which steers people with annual incomes of $79,000 or less toward third-party software they can use for free.
Major tax software providers have slammed Direct File, which threatens to eat into their customer base, saying their offerings help filers maximize their refunds.
“The mission of the IRS is to collect as much revenue as possible to fund the federal government — not to guarantee that Americans get their maximum refund and best outcome at tax time,” the H&R Block spokesperson said.
A TurboTax spokesperson bashed Direct File as a “thinly veiled scheme where billions of taxpayer dollars will be unnecessarily used to pay for something already completely free of charge today.”
The IRS didn’t respond to a request for comment.
TurboTax netted its parent company, Intuit, over $4 billion in revenue in the 2023 fiscal year. At H&R Block, where assisted tax preparation drives most of its business, DIY products brought in over $300 million in revenue last fiscal year.
Last week, the Federal Trade Commission issued an opinion finding TurboTax engaged in “deceptive advertising” by promoting its tax products as free, even though many customers who are drawn to its no-cost product, like Knight, get hit with charges while using it. The regulator ordered the company to stop making what it said were misleading claims about who’s eligible for its free tier.
TurboTax contends it has “always been clear, fair, and transparent with its customers,” and said it doesn’t expect any significant impact to its business from the FTC’s move.

2024-02-13T20:28:40.575Z,Disneyland characters and parades cast members launch unionization effort,NBC News,"Cast members at Disneyland in California have sought to organize with the United States' primary stage actors union.
Some 1,700 characters and parades workers are receiving unionization cards from the group, Actors' Equity Association, according to an association statement.
""As the Entertainment Cast Members at the Disneyland Resort, it is time for us to come together as a union, to use our collective power to ensure that the park is a safer, more sustainable place to build careers and share magic with Guests from all over the world,"" the leaders of the park's unionization effort, which they are calling Magic United, said in a statement released by the association.
Among the workers whom union drive leaders are seeking to organize are cast members who bring ""characters to life in shows, meet and greets and character dining experiences.""
Others who have signed union authorization cards include parade performers, hosts, trainers and other roles that support their fellow cast members, the association said.
In a statement to NBC News, a Disneyland official said, “We believe that our Cast Members deserve to have all the facts and the right to a confidential vote that recognizes their individual choices.”
Equity, as the collective is colloquially known, already represents hundreds of performers at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida. Union drive leaders said it chose Equity because of “how well they work with Disney in Florida, on Broadway and on tour.”
“Our Walt Disney World colleagues exemplify how you can be pro-Disney and pro-union at the same time,” the leaders said.
""Disney workers are openly and powerfully invested in and loyal to the Walt Disney Company and its values, so it’s reasonable for them to expect ‘the happiest place on earth’ to pay them fairly and prioritize their health and safety,"" Actors’ Equity Association President Kate Shindle said. ""Unionizing is the collective pathway to ensuring that the magic makers share not only in the happiness, but in the $9.13 billion in quarterly ‘experience’ revenue that Disney announced to its shareholders on February 7.""
Disney is facing a variety of pressures and has lost 44% of its value over the past three years, but Tuesday's announcement did not seem to affect the company's market value, as its shares were trading higher on the day.
And while tens of thousands of Disney workers are already represented by a union, the drive still represents a significant event for a company whose founder was famously opposed to unions.
A Disney spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

2024-02-21T21:05:34.031Z,Chase customers sue over fees for depositing checks that bounce,NBC News,"JPMorgan Chase was sued by customers who accused the largest U.S. bank of having unfairly charged fees when they deposited checks that, through no fault of their own, bounced.
In a proposed class action filed on Tuesday night, five customers said New York-based Chase docked $12 “deposited item returned fees” from their accounts when checks they tried to deposit were returned unpaid.
Checks can bounce for many reasons, including when writers do not have enough money in their accounts or issue stop payment orders, or when the checks contain errors.
The Chase customers called the bank’s “junk fees” for returned checks “unconscionable” and “predatory,” citing an October 2022 U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau bulletin that said indiscriminately charging such fees was likely illegal.
“By charging these deposited item return fees, Chase unfairly targeted its customers with financial penalties for faulty checks the customers had no hand in issuing,” the complaint said. “They did nothing wrong, yet were penalized.”
Chase declined to comment on the lawsuit, but said it stopped charging the fees in December 2022.
The five customers said they were charged between November 2021 and October 2022.
Their lawyer Lisa Considine called imposing the fees “a pervasive and unfair industry practice.”
The complaint seeks at least $5 million of damages for Chase customers nationwide, alleging violations of New York, California, Illinois and New Jersey consumer protection laws. It was filed in the White Plains, New York federal court.
In October, the Biden administration called for a crackdown on hidden and surprise fees in banking and other sectors including car rentals, hotels and concert tickets, saying the fees cost Americans tens of billions of dollars a year.

Dollar Tree, which has owned Family Dollar since 2015, said Wednesday that 600 Family Dollar stores would close in the first half of 2024, with another 370 locations closing over the next several years.
In addition, 30 Dollar Tree-branded stores will close over that time period.
The company currently oversees a total of 16,774 stores between the two brands.
Shares of Dollar Tree fell as much as 13% in Wednesday trading as the company also posted financial results that missed analysts' expectations, including a net loss of more than $1.7 billion for the fourth quarter.
Amid higher costs throughout the economy, consumers have begun shifting to lower-margin goods compared with higher spending on discretionary items earlier in the post-pandemic period. That has challenged dollar stores' profitability. Industry rival Dollar General has also faced similar issues.
Reuters has also reported that Chinese e-commerce platform Temu has also begun taking market share from dollar stores.
Additionally, dollar stores are facing an increase in theft, referred to as ""shrink"" in the retail industry. Dollar Tree said shrink remains ""elevated"" and would lower the company's profitability going forward. On the company's earnings call Wednesday, company executives said shrink had been accelerating.

JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of America reported a combined $2.2 billion in overdraft fees in 2023, roughly $700 million less than the previous year, according to regulatory filings.
Overdraft fees are triggered when a customer attempts to spend more than the balance in their checking accounts. At around $35 per transaction at many banks, the fees have been a lucrative line item for the industry, generating $280 billion in revenue since 2000, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
The industry is girding itself for a battle over overdraft after the CFPB last month unveiled a proposal to limit charges to as little as $3 per transaction. Banks say overdraft services are a lifeline that helps users avoid worse options like payday loans, while critics including President Biden say the fees exploit struggling Americans.
The practice has brought unwelcome attention to big banks. During a 2021 hearing, Sen. Elizabeth Warren needled JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon on the fees. Dimon at the time refused her call to refund $1.5 billion to customers.
But even before recent efforts by regulators, banks’ haul from overdraft has been on the decline. Pandemic stimulus money helped Americans trigger fewer of the fees starting in 2020, and then firms including Capital One, Citigroup and Ally voluntarily ended the practice.
Those who kept the fees, including JPMorgan, limited the types of transactions that trigger penalties, got rid of fees for bounced checks and introduced one-day grace periods and $50 cushions to reduce their frequency.
Bank of America cut the fees to $10 from $35 in 2022.
“Whether folks eliminated some fees or dramatically reduced the cost of others, there’s been very significant shifts here,” said Jennifer Tescher, CEO of nonprofit group Financial Health Network. “Banks aren’t just getting rid of overdraft, they’re trying to find more customer-friendly ways of meeting their liquidity needs while making sure they aren’t overextended.”
Industrywide overdraft revenue totaled $7.7 billion in 2022, 35% below the 2019 level, according to a May CFPB report that included all U.S. banks with at least $1 billion in assets.
Recent regulatory filings show that the trend continued last year, though JPMorgan and Wells Fargo remain by far the largest players in overdraft.
JPMorgan had $1.1 billion in overdraft revenue last year, about 12% lower than in 2022. Wells Fargo saw a 27% decline to $937 million. Bank of America posted a 64% decline to $140 million.
More than 70% of overdraft transactions no longer incur fees, and customers can choose accounts that don’t allow the penalties, a JPMorgan spokesman told CNBC. Wells Fargo and Bank of America declined to comment.
“Our customers continue to tell us they want and need access to overdraft protection, which helps them when they are temporarily short on money,” the JPMorgan spokesman said.

2024-02-06T14:28:28.036Z,"Honda recalls 750,000 U.S. vehicles over air bag defect",NBC News,"Honda said on Tuesday it was recalling 750,000 vehicles in the United States over a defect involving air bags which could deploy unintentionally during a crash.
The front passenger seat weight sensor may crack and short circuit, failing to suppress the air bag as intended, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said on Tuesday. Dealers will replace the seat weight sensors.
The recall includes certain Honda Pilot, Accord and Civic vehicles from the 2020-2022 model years, and some Honda CR-V and Passport vehicles from the 2020 and 2021 model years.
Honda, in a statement filed with the safety regulator, said it had 3,834 warranty claims, and that there were no reports of injuries or deaths related to the recall issue since June 2020.
In a bid to explain how the defect may have originated, Honda told the NHTSA that after a natural disaster impacted the manufacturing plant of a subcontractor, a supplier temporarily changed the base material in the printed circuit board of the seat weight sensor. The alternative material used “could allow additional strain to the printed circuit board”, it said.
Toyota in December recalled 1.12 million vehicles worldwide because a short circuit in a sensor could cause air bags not to deploy as designed.
Also in December, Honda recalled 4.5 million vehicles worldwide over risks of fuel pump failure, which included 2.54 million vehicles in the United States.

2024-02-18T13:00:40.000Z,Young adults are getting used to living on a financial cliff,NBC News,"Young adults’ wealth is growing, but they’re still living and spending in the here and now. Many feel they don’t have a choice.
The net worth of Americans ages 18-39 surged by 80% from the start of 2019 to the third quarter of last year, Federal Reserve Bank of New York research shows, blowing past the rates for older generations.
But much of the gains are from investments that climbed alongside stock markets and largely don’t translate into disposable income. And while many millennials (ages 28-43, according to Pew Research) — and plenty of their Gen Z near-peers (12-27) — are pulling in bigger paychecks, they’re still pumping that cash into pricier everyday expenses, from essentials like rent to luxuries like leisure travel.
We want to enjoy our lives, but we’re always waiting for the shoe to drop.
Hala Easmael, 32, Philadelphia
“We’re the generations that got stuck between a rock and a hard place,” said Hala Easmael, a 32-year-old pharmacy technician in Philadelphia. After her cohort came of age between two recessions, a pandemic and crushing student loan debt, “we want to enjoy our lives, but we’re always waiting for the shoe to drop,” she said.
Easmael earned her masters in biochemistry and biomedical sciences in 2020 and took a job making around $100,000 annually as an epidemiologist for the state of New Jersey. But after two years in the role and with inflation then hovering near 40-year highs, she left her job to pursue a pharmacy doctorate, hoping to lift her earning prospects.
While she’s saving on rent by living with her parents, her full academic scholarship doesn’t make up for a $70,000 pay cut working part time as a nanny and hospital pharmacy tech while also interning at Walgreens.
“There’s absolutely no way you can be OK with one job,” said Easmael, who said she still contributes at least 3% of her wages to her 401(k) even as her savings have “dwindled drastically.”
In a CNBC survey of 18-to-34-year-olds last month, 42% said they’re earning more than they were a year ago, versus 27% making less. Yet nearly half said they couldn’t cover more than one month’s expenses if unemployed, and only 11% could do so for a year. Just 32% of Gen Zers and 37% of millennials are comfortable with their emergency savings, a recent Bankrate report found, though their Gen X counterparts felt only slightly better (38%).
Despite her financial pressures, Easmael still spends $300 to $400 a month on fashion, after a 100-pound weight loss boosted her view that “when you look good, you feel good.”
Many young adults are making their own similar calculations about how and when to spend versus save, experts say.
“People who have had to postpone things that they want to do may have a mindset, at this point, that they’re willing to assume the risks to make some of those things finally happen,” said Kevin Mahoney, a millennial-focused certified financial planner in Washington, D.C.
That mentality isn’t exclusive to young people. A “revenge spending” bonanza driven by FOMO, stimulus checks and built-up savings helped power the post-pandemic recovery, and consumer spending has kept chugging above expectations despite higher prices.
But several years out of Covid lockdowns, younger Americans’ outlays on things like travel, recreation and dining out have been outpacing their older peers’ even as the economy slows. As of last summer, the average Gen Zer or millennial was dropping over $400 a month on nonessentials, compared to about $250 for Gen Xers and less than $200 for baby boomers, a Morning Consult report found.
Hence the flurry of headlines around “doom spending,” in which consumers (mostly younger ones) purportedly shop with abandon to soothe anxieties from economic, environmental and geopolitical forces they can’t control. A chorus of scolds has risen in response, from TikTokers warning each other against torching paychecks on extravagances to others promoting “loud budgeting” — declining invitations to spend money and telling friends why.
But as Rue Crowder sees it, “if you go to a dark place, you can stay there. I try to live in the now.”
Tight finances didn’t stop the 34-year-old Houston resident from joining his friends on a cruise to Ensenada, Mexico, last fall, nor from opening a credit card to help finance it.
“As an entrepreneur, it makes it a little easier to take a leap of faith, because you always have to,” said Crowder, who does digital marketing for websites and content creators and previously owned an online men’s underwear shop. Last year he got his commercial driver’s license so he’ll have the option to start truck hauling to increase his earnings.
If you go to a dark place, you can stay there. I try to live in the now. Like, I already believe I’m wealthy.
Rue Crowder, 34, Houston
Millennials’ share of bank card balances surpassed baby boomers’ for the first time in 2023, according to TransUnion. That’s partly because younger consumers, like those who preceded them, are building and using more credit as they get older. But the combination of high inflation and high rates means they’re doing so in a vastly different climate and with steeper consequences, said Michele Raneri, vice president and head of U.S. research and consulting at TransUnion.
“Those two things together are making it harder on young people today than it did even three years ago,” she said. “They’re not able to use the card as a utility. They use it thinking they’re going to use it today and I’ll pay it off in like three months” — after racking up interest fees.
Delinquencies for balances more than 90 days past due rose 2.6% across all age groups from the fourth quarter of 2022 to the same period last year, TransUnion found, the highest level in a decade.
Even high-earning young adults say devoting large chunks of their growing incomes to near-term expenses makes it hard to plan ahead.
Mohit Singla, 33, became a senior director at a biotech firm in September, with a 20% pay bump that brought his and his wife’s combined annual income close to $500,000. But a new baby arrived in December, and the rent for their two-bedroom unit in Jersey City, New Jersey, has jumped to $5,500 from $3,700 three years ago.
They would have bought a house and maybe a car as well “if the economy had been different,” Singla said. “We still can, but it doesn’t make sense” with elevated mortgage rates, he said.
About 18% of millennials and 12% of Gen Zers said in a September Redfin survey that they believe they’ll never own a home. The top reason was affordability. Median home sale prices are 30% higher than at the beginning of 2019, and savings that some would’ve put toward down payments are now being spent elsewhere.
Everything feels like a splurge.
Mohit Singla, 33, Jersey City, N.J.
Fine dining is the one indulgence Singla and his wife have agreed to hold on to, spending no more than $200 on an upscale meal every other weekend.
Despite wealth gains, young adults’ financial pessimism has encouraged many to spend in ways that make them happy now, said Kyla Scanlon, author of “In This Economy? How Money & Markets Really Work.”
“People are just exhausted, and so if you’re asking them to think five to 10 years in the future, well I can barely think about tomorrow,” she said. In an Intuit survey last month, two-thirds of Gen Zers said they weren’t confident they’d ever afford to retire, and nearly three-quarters hesitated to set long-term goals.
Singla, a millennial, doesn’t feel much more certain about what steps to take. “If I had to leave my job and take a break or take a vacation, I used to feel comfortable we could do that,” he said. Now, “everything feels like a splurge.”
Crowder, for his part, doesn’t see himself on a nihilistic joyride. He wants to get better at budgeting, but he said he’s determined to be content after a run of financial hardship during the pandemic — something many other Black Americans experienced, too.
Before moving to Houston, Crowder was sleeping in the living room of his mother’s two-bedroom Nashville-area apartment. When her landlord announced plans to renovate and hike her rent to $1,000 a month from $600, she moved elsewhere and he struck out to explore another city, he said.
The Biden administration has pushed to narrow racial gaps in employment, homeownership and other measures. But Black Americans’ average real wealth, across all age groups, has yet to recover to 2019 levels, New York Fed researchers found — even as white wealth growth exceeded that of Black and Hispanic Americans by 30 and 9 percentage points, respectively, between the start of 2019 and the third quarter last year.
Crowder remains upbeat, though. He pays about $140 a week for a room in an eight-bedroom home he found listed on PadSplit, keeping his living costs down. While his credit score is low and his savings have shrunk to $1,000 in the last couple years, he said his debts total only around $1,200, all of it on credit cards.
“I already believe I’m wealthy,” he said.

2024-03-13T22:21:25.133Z,Yeezy shoe sales lead Adidas to $150 million in donations to anti-hate groups,NBC News,"Adidas said Wednesday that it’s donated or is planning to give away more than $150 million to groups fighting antisemitism and other forms of hate from the sales of Yeezy shoes last year after it severed ties with Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West.
The German sportswear brand had 1.2 billion euros ($1.3 billion) worth of popular Yeezy sneakers piled up in warehouses after it broke off its partnership with Ye in October 2022 over his antisemitic and other offensive comments on social media and in interviews.
Adidas decided to sell some of the remaining shoes in batches, with two releases last year and another that launched late last month, and donate a portion of the proceeds to anti-hate groups.
The company has made donations to the Anti-Defamation League and the Philonise & Keeta Floyd Institute for Social Change, run by social justice advocate Philonise Floyd, the brother of George Floyd.
Net sales of what’s left of Adidas’ former banner line of sneakers brought in about 750 million euros last year, compared with over 1.2 billion euros in 2022, the company reported.
Of the 300 million-euro profit it earned from the sales of Yeezy shoes last year, the company said it had given away or planned to donate over 140 million euros (about $152 million).
Adidas said deciding to sell a big chunk of its Yeezy inventory and improved operations helped it pull out operating profit of 268 million euros last year, a nearly 60% plunge from the previous year. It blamed a high tax rate for ending the year with a net loss of 58 million euros, a massive turnaround from net income of 254 million euros in 2022.
“Although by far not good enough, 2023 ended better than what I had expected at the beginning of the year,” said CEO Bjørn Gulden, who took over the top job last year.
Looking forward, Adidas expects to make about 250 million euros in sales of the remaining Yeezy shoes this year.
But the Herzogenaurach, Germany-based company points to North America as a persistent problem spot, expecting revenue to decline in the mid-single digits this year and grow everywhere else. It said that North America was “particularly affected by the negative Yeezy impact” and that revenue there dropped 16% last year.
Adidas expects to almost double operating profit to about 500 million euros this year despite “macroeconomic challenges and geopolitical tensions.” It plans to further scale up popular shoe lines like Samba that are seeing “extraordinary demand,” launch new ones and get a boost from major sports events like the Paris Olympics this summer.
Adidas shares were up slightly in late morning trading.

2024-02-21T21:09:30.180Z,The IRS will pursue business private jet usage in a new round of audits on high-wealth taxpayers,NBC News,"First, there were trackers on Taylor Swift and other celebrities’ private jet usage. Now, there will be more scrutiny on executives’ personal use of business aircraft who write it off as a tax expense.
IRS leadership said Wednesday that the agency will start conducting dozens of audits on businesses’ private jets and how they are used personally by executives and written off as a tax deduction — as part of the agency’s ongoing mission of going after high-wealth tax cheats who game the tax system at the expense of American taxpayers.
The audits will focus on aircraft used by large corporations and high-income taxpayers and whether the tax purpose of the jet use is being properly allocated, the IRS says.
“At this time of year, when millions of hardworking taxpayers are working on their taxes, we want them to feel confident that everyone is playing by the same rules,” IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel said on a call with reporters to preview the announcement. Tax season began Jan. 29.
“These aircraft audits will help ensure high-income groups aren’t flying under the radar with their tax responsibilities,” he said.
There are more than 10,000 corporate jets in the US., according to the IRS, valued at tens of millions of dollars and many can be fully deducted.
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, passed during the Trump administration, allowed for 100% bonus depreciation and expensing of private jets — which allowed taxpayers to write off the cost of aircraft purchased and put into service between September 2017 and January 2023.
Werfel said the federal tax collector will use resources from Democrats’ Inflation Reduction Act to more closely examine private jet usage — which has not been closely scrutinized during the past decade as funding fell sharply in the last decade.“Our audit rates have been anemic,” he said on the call. An April 2023 IRS report on tax audit data states that “continued resource constraints have limited the agency’s ability to address high-end noncompliance” stating that in tax year 2018, audit rates for people making more than $10 million were 9.2%, down from 13.6% in 2012. And in the same time period, overall corporate audit rates fell from 1.3% to .6%.
Werfel said audits related to aircraft usage could increase in the future depending on the results of the initial audits and as the IRS continues hiring more examiners.
“To be clear, that doesn’t mean everyone in a high-income category partnership or corporation is evading or avoiding their tax responsibility,” Werfel said. “But it does mean that there’s more work to do for the IRS to make sure people are paying what they owe.”

2024-02-27T17:53:20.718Z,Kellogg CEO faces backlash for suggesting people eat 'cereal for dinner' to save money,NBC News,"WK Kellogg CEO Gary Pilnick’s cost-saving suggestion of eating cereal for dinner has yet to win over consumers who are feeling the strain of grocery prices.
Pilnick posed buying cereal for dinner to save money on groceries in an appearance on CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street” Feb. 21. He was responding to a question regarding how high food prices are and how more than 11% of disposable consumer income goes toward purchasing it, according to the most recent data available at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. A clip from the interview is making the rounds online and has been met with what dissenters see as the irony in Pilnick’s proposal.
“The cereal category has always been quite affordable and it tends to be a great destination when consumers are under pressure,” the cereal company’s CEO said.
“If you think about the cost of cereal for a family versus what they might otherwise do, that’s going to be much more affordable,” he added. “We talk about making sure that we have the right pack at the right price in the right place. So having a different sized pack that’ll have a different price point, that’ll take some pressure off the consumer while they’re shopping. So, those are some of the things that we’re doing. But, in general, the cereal category is a place that a lot of folks might come to because the price of a bowl of cereal with milk and with fruit is less than a dollar. So you can imagine why a consumer under pressure might find that to be a good place to go.”
As this portion of the interview circulates online, social media users ripped into Pilnick for suggesting what they feel he would never regularly do himself.
“Greedflation is forcing families to make choices like eating cereal for dinner to save money. Kellogg’s CEO is bragging about it while they show the huge climb in corporate profits that helped create the problem in the first place. F--- this sh--,” a critic posted on X.
Pilnick’’s annual salary is $1 million plus up to $4.4 million more in bonuses as of September 2023, per a filing with the SEC. The company reported $651 million in net sales as of Dec. 30, the end of the last quarter.
“Meanwhile, he’s eating at 5 star restaurants every night and when he isn’t, his personal chef cooks him dinner. Absolutely disgusting. Eat. The. Rich,” one person commented on an Instagram post of the clip.
“People: we don’t have dinner, we starving. CEO: then just eat cereals. People: but they expensive. CEO: We hear you! we’re making the packs smaller, so it costs less,” another person commented on the YouTube video.
“Im sorry but who and what ceo would even have the confidence to say something like this? I’m 30 something and cereal for dinner isn’t nutrition. Low income does this for something vs nothing,” another person wrote under the YouTube video.
WK Kellogg did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In the full CNBC interview that aired, Pilnick was asked about “the potential” for his cost-cutting solution to “land the wrong way.”
“It’s landing really well right now,” he answered. “Over 25% of our consumption is outside the breakfast occasion. A lot of it’s at dinner and that occasion continues to grow. Cereal for dinner is something that is probably more on trend now and we would expect to continue as that consumer is under pressure.”

2024-02-21T00:02:04.666Z,"Capital One-Discover merger could put a bigger squeeze on credit card users, experts warn",NBC News,"Capital One’s $35.3 billion deal to buy Discover is a long way from being completed.
But consumer advocates and some lawmakers are already raising questions about how the proposed merger could affect credit-card users — many of whom are already under pressure from high interest rates and record debts.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., a longtime proponent of tighter financial regulation, called for federal officials to block the deal.
“The merger of @CapitalOne and @Discover threatens our financial stability, reduces competition, and would increase fees and credit costs for American families,” Warren, who is also the chair of the Senate Banking Subcommittee on Economic Policy, posted on X.
Industry groups and experts warned against a shrinking credit card market dominated by a handful of large players, which they said are more likely to squeeze customers.
“We should be worried about the functionality of the credit card market in general. This merger probably heightens that,” said Adam Rust, director of financial services at the Consumer Federation of America, a national network of consumer advocacy groups.
While analysts generally say the merger stands a decent shot at securing regulatory approval, “it would face gale-force headwinds from a Washington that is deeply skeptical of consolidation [and] anxious regarding consumer-facing issues in an election year,” Isaac Boltansky, director of policy research at BTIG, a global financial services firm, said in a statement.
But blocking the tie-up could be seen as helping Visa and Mastercard, the credit card giants some policymakers have criticized as a duopoly in need of a shakeup from more serious rivals.
Both Visa and Mastercard grew their revenues by 11% and 12.5%, respectively, between late 2022 and the end of last year thanks to strong consumer spending. The four biggest card brands — Visa, Mastercard, American Express and Discover — saw more than $10 trillion in purchases in 2023, up 6.4% from the year before, according to the Nilson Report.
The top 30 credit card companies comprise about 95% of Americans’ credit card debt, BTIG estimates, which could fuel pushback over competition concerns.
Rust nodded to a report last week from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which found that the 25 largest credit card issuers already charge customers interest rates eight to 10 points higher than small- and medium-sized banks and credit unions.
“All those reasons point to some kind of imbalance, and it’s favoring large credit issuers,” said Rust. “It has to do with their marketing budgets, their ability to get their brands in front of consumers on television or send out mailers.”
If it goes through, the deal could further whittle down customers’ options to shop around for the best credit card, Rust and others warned.
“Consumers would always rather have more options, because more competition is generally better,” said Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst at LendingTree. But “if Capital One sees that there’s a bunch of overlap between what they have and what Discover brings to the table, and they want to combine the two instead of keeping them as separate brands, you could end up seeing some of those offers get reduced,” he said.
The average credit card interest rate in the U.S. is 24.61%, according to LendingTree, the highest since the credit marketplace began tracking monthly rates in 2019. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said earlier this month that credit card debts entering “serious delinquency” jumped from 4% to over 6% from the last quarter of 2022 to the same period last year, at a time when total consumer debt has hit a whopping $17.5 trillion.
The National Community Reinvestment Coalition, an advocacy group that looks to funnel private investment into underserved communities, also wasted no time criticizing the merger.
“It is very difficult to imagine how federal regulators could allow Capital One to buy Discover given the requirement that mergers benefit the public as well as insiders,” CEO Jess Van Tol said in a statement Tuesday. “The deal also poses massive antitrust concerns, given the vertical integration of Capital One’s credit card lending with Discover’s credit card network.”
Representatives for Capital One and Discover didn’t respond to requests for comment. The credit card industry has pushed back on accusations that it isn’t sufficiently competitive. A banking industry group said last week in response to the CFPB’s report that borrowers have plenty of card terms, perks and features to choose from.
Experts expect it would take at least a year for a merger to be completed, and potentially longer for the full consumer impact to come into view.
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a financial industry watchdog, moved last month to enhance its review of proposed combinations. That could throw up more hurdles for Capital One and Discover, Rust said, potentially by involving more entities in the review process, such as local community groups in various cities where the companies operate.
The Biden administration has tightened its scrutiny of big mergers and acquisitions, but last spring’s collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic Bank put extra attention on the banking sector. The Department of Justice has said it’s focused on guarding against “excessive market power” as it reviews deals alongside bank regulators.
If the Capital One-Discover deal isn’t blocked, some credit card rates may well be lower by the time it’s completed, with the Federal Reserve expected to begin cutting interest rates later this year. But borrowers shouldn’t wait to pay down any existing high-interest debt, said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate. “It’s going to stay high-cost credit card debt, regardless of who acquires whom,” he said.
There could be a silver lining for customers of both companies should the merger go through: rewards.
Card issuers like Capital One have claimed the proposed Credit Card Competition Act — which would require them to allow merchants to use at least two card networks to process card transactions — would drive up their costs so much they’d have to curtail credit card rewards programs.
Acquiring Discover would give Capital One “an opportunity for more revenue and exposure,” LendingTree’s Schulz said, which could offset potential cost increases and help fund generous rewards.

2024-02-27T14:45:43.036Z,Macy's is closing 150 stores nationwide as it seeks 'bold new chapter' with greater focus on luxury,NBC News,"Macy's plans to close approximately 150 stores nationwide as part of a massive reorganization that will see it pivot to a greater focus on luxury sales.
The retailer on Tuesday announced an initiative it's calling a ""bold new chapter"" that will involve shuttering ""underproductive"" locations, including approximately 50 by the end of the company's current fiscal year.
In an email, a Macy's spokesperson declined to comment about which specific stores are closing. In a statement obtained by NBC News on Tuesday, San Francisco Mayor London Breed said she had learned that Macy's 400,000 square-foot flagship location in the city's Union Square will eventually be part of the closures, though not in the initial round of 50.
The closures will leave approximately 350 Macy's locations, as well as Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury beauty and skin care stores.
The company sees those latter brands as its future: It said it plans to take advantage of its leadership position in the luxury market, where it said Bloomingdale’s and Bluemercury have been ""outperformers"" within the Macy’s portfolio.
The company plans to build out 15 new Bloomingdale’s stores and at least 30 new Bluemercury stores, along with roughly 30 Bluemercury remodels, over the next three years.
“We are making the necessary moves to reinvigorate relationships with our customers through improved shopping experiences, relevant assortments and compelling value,” CEO Tony Spring said in a news release.
Macy's has been under pressure from investor activists seeking an outright sale of the company due to its decadelong underperformance, with Macy's real estate considered its most valuable asset.
However, Macy's recently rejected a takeover offer, saying it undervalued the firm.
Wall Street's immediate reaction to Tuesday's announcement was negative, with shares trading more than 2% lower in premarket action.

2024-02-05T18:49:29.953Z,Mortgage rates jump back over 7% as stronger economic data rolls in,NBC News,"The average rate on the popular 30-year fixed mortgage crossed over 7% on Monday for the first time since December, hitting 7.04%, according to Mortgage News Daily.
It comes after the rate took the sharpest jump in more than a year Friday, after the January employment report came in much higher than expected. Rates then moved up even more Monday after a monthly manufacturing report came in high as well.
Mortgage rates have been on a wild ride since the summer, briefly crossing to a 20-year high of 8% in October. Rates then fell sharply, as investors saw more and more evidence that the Federal Reserve would end its latest phase of interest rate increases.
Mortgage rates do not follow the Fed directly, but they follow loosely the yield on the 10-year Treasury, which is heavily influenced by the central bank’s impression of the economy at any given time.
“The rapid increase in rates over the past two days is actually not too surprising given the fact that the market was widely seen as overly optimistic on the Fed rate cut outlook. The Fed has repeatedly pointed to economic data having the final say in that outlook and data has been shockingly unfriendly to rates as of Friday morning’s jobs report,” said Matthew Graham, chief operating officer at Mortgage News Daily.
As mortgage rates fell over the past two months, buyers seemed to be returning to the market. That coincided with a slight uptick in the number of homes for sale. Total inventory, however, is still historically low and is keeping competition high. It is also keeping home prices stubbornly hot.
High prices and low supply combined to make 2023 the worst for home sales since 1995. Most predict 2024 will be better.
“The strong job market is good news for the spring buying season as higher household incomes are a necessary component, but it also means that mortgage rates are not likely to drop much further at this point,” said Michael Fratantoni, chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association.
Mortgage applications to purchase a home had been rising steadily, but fell back in the last few weeks, as mortgage rates edged higher. With the all-important spring housing market closing in, rates are more important than ever, given high and still-rising home prices.
The median price of an existing home sold in December (the most recent data) was $382,600, according to the National Association of Realtors, an increase of 4.4% from December 2022. That was the sixth consecutive month of year-over-year price gains. The median price for the full year was $389,800, a record high.
Given how high prices are, even small rate swings are having an outsized effect on monthly payments, which are the final determination of affordability. Just a half percentage point swing can cost or save a buyer more than $200 a month on the median-priced home. So what next?
“The future of rates in 2024 is all about ifs and thens,” said Graham. “If we see more data like last Friday’s jobs report, rates will have a hard time getting back below 7%. But inflation is even more important than the labor market. If inflation comes in cooler than expected, it could balance the outlook.”

2024-03-04T12:38:52.872Z,Apple hit with more than $1.95 billion E.U. antitrust fine over music streaming,NBC News,"The European Commission, the European Union’s executive arm, on Monday hit Apple with a 1.8 billion euros ($1.95 billion) antitrust fine for abusing its dominant position on the market for the distribution of music streaming apps.
The commission said it found that Apple had applied restrictions on app developers that prevented them from informing iOS users about alternative and cheaper music subscription services available outside of the app.
Apple also banned developers of music streaming apps from providing any instructions about how users could subscribe to these cheaper offers, the commission alleged.
This is Apple’s first antitrust fine from Brussels and is among one of the biggest dished out to a technology company by the E.U.
The European Commission opened an investigation into Apple after a complaint from Spotify in 2019. The probe was narrowed down to focus on contractual restrictions that Apple imposed on app developers which prevent them from informing iPhone and iPad users of alternative music subscription services at lower prices outside of the App Store.
Apple’s conduct lasted almost 10 years, according to the commission, and “may have led many iOS users to pay significantly higher prices for music streaming subscriptions because of the high commission fee imposed by Apple on developers and passed on to consumers in the form of higher subscription prices for the same service on the Apple App Store.”
The fine will ramp up tensions between Big Tech and Brussels at a time when the E.U. is increasing scrutiny of these firms.
Last year, the commission designated Apple among other tech firms such as Microsoft and Meta as “gatekeepers” under a landmark regulation called the Digital Markets Act, which broadly came into effect last year.
The term gatekeepers refers to massive internet platforms which the E.U. believes are restricting access to core platform services, such as online search, advertising, and messaging and communications.
The Digital Markets Act aims to clamp down on anti-competitive practices from tech players, and force them to open out some of their services to other competitors. Smaller internet firms and other businesses have complained about being hurt by these companies’ business practices.
These laws have already had an impact on Apple. The Cupertino, California-based giant announced plans this year to open up its iPhone and iPad to alternative app stores other than its own. Developers have long-complained about the 30% fee Apple charges on in-app purchases.

2024-03-06T15:34:15.803Z,Russian oligarch's yacht costs U.S. taxpayers close to $1 million a month,NBC News,"A mega-yacht seized by U.S. authorities from a Russian oligarch is costing the government nearly $1 million a month to maintain, according to new court filings.
The U.S. Department of Justice is seeking permission to sell a 348-foot yacht called Amadea, which it seized in 2022, alleging that it was owned by sanctioned Russian billionaire Suleiman Kerimov. The government said it wants to sell the $230 million yacht due to the “excessive costs” of maintenance and crew, which it said could total $922,000 a month.
“It is excessive for taxpayers to pay nearly a million dollars per month to maintain the Amadea when these expenses could be reduced to zero through [a] sale,” according to a court filing by U.S. prosecutors on Friday.
The monthly charges for Amadea, which is now docked in San Diego, California, include $600,000 per month in running costs: $360,000 for the crew; $75,000 for fuel; and $165,000 for maintenance, waste removal, food and other expenses. They also include $144,000 in monthly pro-rata insurance costs and special charges including dry-docking fees, at $178,000, bringing the total to $922,000, according to the filings.
The battle over Amadea and the costs to the government highlight the financial and legal challenges of seizing and selling assets owned by Russian oligarchs after the country’s invasion of Ukraine. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said last week that the European Union should use profits from more than $200 billion of frozen Russian assets to fund Ukraine’s war effort.
Her comments echoed government calls in the spring of 2022 to freeze the yachts, private jets and mansions of Russian billionaires in hopes of putting pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin and raising money for the war effort.
Yet, nearly two years later, the legal process for proving ownership of the Russian assets and selling them has proven to be far more time-consuming and costly. In London, Russian billionaire Eugene Shvidler has waged a court battle over his private jets that were impounded, and Sergei Naumenko has been appealing the detention of his superyacht Phi.
The battle over Amadea began in April 2022, when it was seized in Fiji at the request of the U.S. government, according to the court filings.
Though the U.S. alleges that the yacht is owned by Kerimov, who made his fortune in mining, attorneys for Eduard Khudainatov, an ex-Rosneft CEO who has not been sanctioned, say he owns the yacht, and have sought to take back possession of the vessel.
In court filings, Khudainatov’s attorneys have objected to the U.S. government’s efforts to sell the yacht, saying a rushed sale could lead to a distressed sale price and that the maintenance costs are minor relative to the potential sale value.
Khudainatov’s attorneys refuse to pay the ongoing maintenance costs as long as the government pursues a sale and forfeiture. However, they say their client will reimburse the U.S. government for the more than $20 million already spent to maintain the yacht if it’s returned to its proper owner.
In court papers, the government says Kerimov disguised his ownership of Amadea through a series of shell companies and other owners. They say emails between crew members show Kerimov “was the beneficial owner of the yacht, irrespective of the titleholder of the vessel.”
The emails show that Kerimov and his family ordered several interior improvements of the yacht, including a new pizza oven and spa, and that between 2021 and 2022, when the boat was seized, “there were no guest trips on the Amadea that did not include either Kerimov or his family members,” according to the court filings.
The government also says Kerimov has been trying to sell Amadea for years, so a sale would be in keeping with his intent.
“This is not a situation in which a court would be ordering sale of a precious heirloom that a claimant desperately wishes to keep for sentimental reasons,” the government said in filings.
Even if Amadea were sold quickly, the proceeds wouldn’t automatically go to the government. Under law, the money would be held while Khudainatov and the government continue their battle in court over the ownership and forfeiture.

2024-02-28T16:54:03.772Z,Former FTX chief Sam Bankman-Fried seeks no more than six years in prison as sentencing trial awaits,NBC News,"Lawyers for Sam Bankman-Fried, the former head of the collapsed cryptocurrency exchange FTX, have requested a sentence of just five to six years in prison in the wake of his conviction last year on seven counts of fraud.
U.S. probation officials have recommended a sentence of 100 years for Bankman-Fried's role in orchestrating what prosecutors described as an elaborate, multibillion-dollar fraud. He is scheduled to be sentenced March 28.
In a 98-page memo filed Tuesday, Bankman-Fried's lawyers portray him as suffering from an array of neurological and personality issues that could not be overcome, turning him into a ""tragic"" figure.
""Sam presents at times as a paradox,"" the lawyers write. ""Not because he is deliberately deceiving or conniving, but rather because that is how he is 'wired' as a human. He has an exceptional IQ, but difficulty with conventional styles of communication, especially around emotion.""
They add that those who know Bankman-Fried know he is ""selfless, altruistic, and cares about those less fortunate.""
""Well before ... FTX ever existed, Sam committed his life to philanthropy, pledging to earn money and give it away, with the goal of 'helping the world’s poorest people,'"" the lawyers write, citing another statement made by a Bankman-Fried character witness.
Bankman-Fried was not motivated by greed or material concerns, the lawyers write — a notion seemingly belied by the lavish style he and his colleagues enjoyed in the Bahamas while they ran FTX, which included living in a $35 million penthouse.
The lawyers further allege that the loss to FTX customers was ultimately zero — and indeed, representatives for the bankruptcy estate of FTX said this month that they expect to fully repay customers and creditors with legitimate claims.
Bankman-Fried is being held at a detention facility in New York City. Citing the statement of a fellow inmate, the lawyers say Bankman-Fried's neurodiversity and lack of physical stature, along with the high-profile nature of his crimes, may put him at risk of physical harm in prison.
""Sam being the 'least physically intimidating person' … has and will lead to him being frequently targeted for hazing, harassment, and assault more so than the average inmate,"" the lawyers write.
Prosecutors have until March 15 to respond to the memo.

2024-02-09T21:21:16.554Z,"S&P 500 closes above 5,000 for first time ever, notches fifth straight winning week",NBC News,"Stocks rose on Friday after December’s revised inflation reading came in lower than first reported, and the S&P 500 closed above 5,000 level as strong earnings and economic news chugged on.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 90 points, or 0.2%, while the S&P 500 rose 0.5%. The Nasdaq Composite added 1.2%.
For the week, the S&P added 1.4%, while the Nasdaq’s gained 2.3%. Both indices notched their fifth straight winning week and 14th winning week in 15. The Dow finished 0.1% lower.
“At the end of the day, we’re still seeing whopping good news on an economic front, and the market is reacting to that,” said Dana D’Auria, co-chief investment officer at Envestnet. “The longer that story plays out, the more likely it seems to the market that we actually are sticking a landing here.”
A solid earnings season, easing inflation data and a resilient economy have charged 2024′s market rally, setting the S&P 500 up for a fifth consecutive week of gains. It’s also propelled the index above the 5,000 level after first touching above the milestone during Thursday’s session. The S&P first crossed 4,000 in April 2021.
“A close above this closely watched level will undoubtedly create headlines and further feed fear of missing out (FOMO) emotions,” said Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial. “Outside of a potential sentiment boost, round numbers such as 5,000 often provide a psychological area of support or resistance for the market.”
A revision lower in December’s consumer price index also helped sentiment. The government adjusted the figure to a 0.2% increase, down from a 0.3% increase initially reported. Core inflation figures, excluding food and energy, were the same. Treasury yields briefly traded lower following the release of the revised figures. January’s CPI figures are due next week.
Megacap technology stocks gained again on Friday, contributing to the S&P’s march above 5,000. Nvidia and Alphabet added more than 2% each. Cloudflare skyrocketed 19.5% on strong earnings, boosting the broader cloud sector in tandem. Semiconductor stocks also rose, with the VanEck Semiconductor ETF edging up 2.2%.
The back half of the fourth-quarter earnings reporting period pressed on, with PepsiCo falling 3.6% on mixed results. Take-Two Interactive slumped 8.7% on a disappointing outlook, while Pinterest dropped 9.5% after issuing a weaker-than-expected forecast and missing revenue estimates.
Despite these negative prints, earnings have so far proven more robust than expected. A total of 332 S&P companies have reported results, with about 81% of them reporting earnings above analyst expectations, according to LSEG. That compares to a 67% beat rate in a typical quarter since 1994.

2024-03-05T15:26:18.521Z,"Bitcoin prices hit all-time high, soaring to nearly $69,000",NBC News,"The price of bitcoin hit an all-time high of about $68,800 Tuesday, surpassing the previous record reached in November 2021.
The cryptocurrency has gained approximately 50% in 2024, and has recovered more than 300% since hitting a post-pandemic low of about $16,500 in December 2022.
The latest rally is being fueled by hopes that the launch of bitcoin exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, will expand the pool of bitcoin buyers.
The Securities and Exchange Commission approved ETFs in January to make it easier for investors to gain exposure to the price movements of bitcoin as part of diversified portfolios without having to go through the sometimes-onerous process of owning the digital coins themselves.
The ETFs have collectively already attracted billions of dollars of investments.
The cryptocurrency world is also banking on a price rally coming after a technical event known as ""halving"" occurs in April. That causes the rate of supply of new bitcoin to decline. So if demand remains unchanged or even grows, the price goes up.
Bitcoin remains highly controversial, and many mainstream investment experts and market regulators urge caution about investing in it. For instance, SEC Chair Gary Gensler said the agency's ETF approvals were not an endorsement of bitcoin, calling it a “speculative, volatile asset.”
And in a blog post in January, executives at the financial giant Vanguard echoed that view, saying cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are ""more of a speculation than an investment,"" which is why the company does not offer crypto products.
""With equities, you own a share of a company that produces goods or services, and many also pay dividends,"" Vanguard said. ""With bonds, you get a stream of interest payments. Commodities are real assets that meet consumption needs, have inflation-hedging properties, and can play a role in certain portfolios.""
""While crypto has been classified as a commodity, it’s an immature asset class that has little history, no inherent economic value, no cash flow, and can create havoc within a portfolio.""

2024-02-06T22:27:50.970Z,"ESPN, Fox and Warner Bros. Discovery to launch joint sports streaming platform this year",NBC News,"Walt Disney’s ESPN, Fox and Warner Bros. Discovery plan to launch a joint sports streaming service this fall, giving consumers a new way to access marquee live sports for the first time, the companies said Tuesday.
The platform, which will be owned by a newly formed company with its own leadership team, does not yet have a name or a price. Disney, Fox and Warner Bros. Discovery will each own a one-third stake.
Consumers would be able to subscribe directly via a new app. Subscribers would also have the ability to bundle the product with the companies’ streaming platforms Disney+, Hulu and Max.
The product will be a skinnier bundle of linear networks than a standard cable offering, specifically tailored for sports fans. It will consist of all the broadcast and cable networks owned by Disney, Fox and Warner Bros. Discovery that carry sports, along with ESPN+.
From Disney, that includes ESPN and its sister networks, such as ESPN2, ESPNU, SECN, ACCN, ESPNEWS, as well as the ABC broadcast network. Warner Bros. Discovery’s networks that showcase sports are TNT, TBS and TruTV. Fox will include the Fox broadcast station along with FS1, FS2 and BTN.
“The launch of this new streaming sports service is a significant moment for Disney and ESPN, a major win for sports fans, and an important step forward for the media business,” Disney Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger said in a statement. “This means the full suite of ESPN channels will be available to consumers alongside the sports programming of other industry leaders as part of a differentiated sports-centric service.”
The launch of the product will not stop ESPN from offering a full direct-to-consumer streaming product, which Disney is still researching, according to a person familiar with the matter. ESPN has previously said it plans on releasing that product this year or next year.
The competitors expect to form the joint service at a time when the value of sports media rights is spiking, but viewers have moved away from watching on traditional cable.
Disney, in particular, has suffered from a shift away from its ESPN network, and sought new ways to revive the business, including searching for strategic partners such as the National Football League and the National Basketball League.

2024-03-01T21:33:12.541Z,Walmart-linked Green Dot Bank receives proposed Federal Reserve order over allegedly faulty consumer practices,NBC News,"Green Dot Bank, best known for partnering with Walmart to provide basic digital banking services to customers, said it has received a proposed consent order from the Federal Reserve over allegedly faulty consumer protection and anti-money laundering practices.
In a filing this week, Green Dot said the consent order — a type of agreement with a regulator that can entail increased monitoring, specific directives and enforcement — relates to activities that stretch back as far as 2017. It noted new leadership had begun arriving in 2020, with current CEO George Gresham appointed in 2022 — but did not specify whether the order covered issues that had occurred since.
Green Dot estimated that its liability related to the proposed order could be $20 million, but warned investors that losses could reach as much as $50 million, according to the filing. Its stock closed down 2% Friday.
In an earnings call this week, Gresham said Green Dot does not  expect any “incremental restrictions to be placed on our business or operations.”
“We take regulatory compliance very seriously, and we have invested considerably in people, in time, and process improvement and product improvement and in money to improve our capabilities in this regard,” Gresham said, according to a transcript of the call. “We are not the same management team or the same company that we were in 2017.”
A Green Dot spokesperson provided an additional comment in an email: “We’re confident about our financial and regulatory positions today and are committed to partnering closely with our regulators to ensure customers are well-served and protected, and that our products are designed and marketed with our customers’ best interests at the forefront.”
A spokesperson for the Federal Reserve said the regulator did not have a comment on the matter.
NBC News reported last summer that some customers had found they were suddenly unable to access their accounts, or had them frozen or closed outright, often with minimal explanation or recourse.
Green Dot subsequently acknowledged that recent tech conversions in its operations had caused temporary outages for “very small segments of customers,” and that ones whom the bank confirmed had been affected were subsequently issued courtesy credits.
It’s unclear whether the proposed consent order is related to these recent customer issues.
In October, the Better Business Bureau noted Green Dot had not responded to an inquiry about a “pattern of complaints” regarding locked accounts and lack of customer support.
In an email, the Green Dot spokesperson said the company was not required to respond to BBB complaints since it is not a formal regulatory body, and Green Dot had stopped paying the BBB in 2022. She added Green Dot also informed the BBB about the company's technology-conversion period, during which complaints spiked, last fall.
Green Dot may be best known for the reloadable debit card it sells at Walmart under the brand Walmart MoneyCards. Thanks in part to this partnership, Green has opened some 67 million accounts over the past decade or so.
A Walmart spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment regarding Green Dot’s announcement of the proposed consent order.
Green Dot also partners with Turbotax and its parent company Intuit on a banking card that allows customers to access their IRS tax refunds.
In an email to NBC, the Green Dot spokesperson acknowledged that “a few isolated incidents” involving customers unable to access their tax refunds had been “quickly resolved,” noting the Green Dot platform had received a number of updates and improvements last year.
“We’re pleased with how quickly and efficiently refunds are being processed and customers are receiving access to their funds,” she said.
Green Dot also sometimes requires some customers, especially those with larger refunds or those who present other common risk indicators, to provide additional verification to access their money, the spokesperson said.
“A small portion” of refunds required these steps, she said, but they have now been fully processed and the funds have been deposited to customers.
Intuit did not respond to a request for comment regarding the news of the proposed consent order.
Green Dot further disclosed this week it is facing a proposed class action suit by a customer related to last year’s outages. The company said it has filed a motion to compel arbitration with the plaintiff and halt the suit, which was filed in October in Texas, where Green Dot is domiciled. Green Dot said it is awaiting a ruling from the District Court for Travis County, Texas on its motion.
Dave Mayo, CEO of FedFis, a financial institutions data analytics and strategy system; and founder of the Bankers Helping Bankers Association, said consent orders like the one Green Dot may now be facing are becoming increasingly common for new financial-technology players — but that this is a sign of a healthy, maturing market.
“None of this from what I’ve seen is life threatening to the institution, or presents a systemic risk in the banking system — we haven’t seen anything to get us concerned,” Mayo said. “When regulators get really involved and clean up — that’s actually a positive evolution.”

2024-02-22T19:26:38.744Z,"Credit cards are charging more 'excess' interest than ever, consumer watchdog says",NBC News,"Credit card companies are hiking rates to record highs to pad their profits, according to a government report released Thursday.
The share of annual percentage rates (APR) that reflects what card companies charge beyond their own lending costs has nearly doubled in the last decade, an analysis by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau finds. That cost borrowers an estimated $25 billion in 2023 alone, the watchdog agency said.
The average credit card APR has swelled from 22.8% in 2023 to about 12.9% in late 2013, according to the bureau. Those rates are at their highest level since the Federal Reserve started gathering data, and so are the profit margins credit card companies have generated from them.
The average APR margin — the share of interest rates card issuers charge beyond the “prime” rate, which generally covers their basic funding costs — has climbed to 14.3%, from 9.6% a decade ago, the CFPB report said.
The researchers estimated an average borrower with $5,300 in credit card debt would’ve paid at least an extra $250 last year thanks to that “excess” margin.
“This additional interest burden may push consumers into persistent debt, accruing more in interest and fees than they pay towards the principal each year — or even delinquency,” the report said.
The CFPB analysis arrives days after Capital One announced plans to acquire Discover Financial for $35.3 billion, drawing bipartisan opposition and concerns from consumer advocates. The new report, which said credit cards are far more profitable for financial firms than many of their other products and services, also comes a week after separate CFPB findings that the biggest lenders tend to charge steeper rates than smaller ones.
The agency has pointed to its research to suggest that industry consolidation risks harming consumers by driving up costs and reducing their options. The top 30 credit card companies make up an estimated 95% of Americans’ credit card debt, according to BTIG, a financial services firm.
“This timely report provides clear evidence to show how credit card companies aren’t just covering their costs — they are applying an additional ‘greedflation charge,’” Adam Rust, director of financial services for the Consumer Federation of America, said in a statement.
The Consumer Bankers Association, a trade group, slammed the CFPB’s findings and allegations that the industry isn’t competitive.
“The CFPB continues to double-down on its false narrative about the state of competition in the credit card market,” the association’s president and CEO, Lindsey Johnson, said in a statement Thursday.
“Try naming any other market that has 10 major participants: 10 auto manufacturers; 10 cellphone manufacturers; 10 internet service providers; 10 pizza delivery chains — much less 4,000 options that consumers can obtain by visiting a website on their smartphones,” she said.
It isn’t just consumers who have been squeezed by the Fed’s interest rate hikes, Bankrate Chief Financial Analyst Greg McBride pointed out. Lenders face higher borrowing costs, too, and “have to price for risk,” he said; their growing APR margins reflect that. Rising credit card delinquencies, which are at their highest level since 2012, are another “factor in why margins are as high as they are right now,” he said.
Both McBride and the CFPB report pointed to a 2009 law as a key source of the margin increases: The CARD Act’s reforms around back-end pricing motivated card issuers to account for risky borrowers up front, they said.
Some experts said card issuers could face growing scrutiny over their APR-setting practices, especially after lenders’ recent changes to overdraft policies have cut into their revenue. The three largest retail banks collected 25% less in overdraft fees last year ahead of a new CFPB proposal to overhaul them.
In the meantime, many cardholders remain under pressure. In a Bankrate survey released Thursday, more than a third of American households (36%) said they had more credit card debt than emergency savings. That’s the highest level since the poll was launched in 2011, with younger consumers more likely than older ones to have more card debt than funds stashed away.
“Financing purchases at 20% interest rates is a sign of the financial strain millions of households are feeling,” McBride said of the survey results.

2024-02-27T15:51:50.238Z,"Prices, jobs, access to groceries: What’s at stake as the FTC tries to kill the Kroger-Albertsons merger",NBC News,"The Biden administration’s move Monday to try to block the $24.6 billion deal to combine Kroger and Albertsons supermarket chains came as no surprise. This White House has launched some of the most aggressive antitrust policies in living memory.
The Federal Trade Commission’s lawsuit holds big stakes for the grocery industry, millions of shoppers and hundreds of thousands of store workers. Yet there’s plenty of debate over who has the stronger case — the companies or the regulators — and how the battle will shake out.
“The FTC’s position that Kroger and Albertsons currently compete with each other, and that keeps prices lower — this is the first time that we’re really hearing that,” said Phil Lempert, a food industry analyst and founder of SupermarketGuru.com.
These are a few of the factors hanging in the balance.
The two companies and the FTC have opposite predictions for what would happen to grocery prices if Kroger is allowed to buy Albertsons.
Federal regulators say the merger would “eliminate fierce competition” between the two chains, reducing the need to keep prices low to lure in shoppers. The FTC alleged one executive involved in the proposed deal described it as “basically creating a monopoly” in the market.
Kroger and Albertsons insist a combined company could better vie with big rivals in pressing suppliers for the best deals, then pass the value on to customers. Kroger said in a statement Monday that it’s committed to investing $500 million on cost reductions as soon as the merger closes, and cited its “long track record of reducing prices every year, with $5 billion invested to lower prices since 2003.”
Neil Saunders, managing director of the retail consultancy GlobalData, is skeptical of the FTC’s price prediction. From behemoths like Walmart, Costco and Amazon to dollar stores, regional chains and discounters like Aldi, grocers of many sizes already compete on price, he said.
“Grocery is a very low-margin business where volume is a prerequisite for delivering what the market wants,” Saunders said. “With this degree of competition, a merged Kroger and Albertsons poses few real threats.”
Lempert tends to agree. By combining forces, “a lot of the duplication between buying and merchandising, really at the executive level, gets diminished,” he said. “They can really become a much more efficient operator.”
Lempert also cast doubt on the FTC’s concerns that the merger could dent quality. Kroger and Albertsons have about 35,000 private-label store brands, he estimated, “and store brands have increased quality over the past probably 10 years.”
But consumer advocates took the FTC’s side.
“Concentration in grocery retail has already caused food prices to skyrocket,” said Stacy Mitchell, co-executive director at the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a nonprofit advocacy group for independent businesses. “This merger would have undoubtedly led to even more consolidation among processors and the closure of independent grocery stores, furthering the proliferation of food deserts in underserved rural and Black and brown communities across the country.”
Some labor advocates cheered the FTC’s push to block the merger as a potential victory for workers, who the agency estimated would number almost 700,000 in a combined company.
Seth Harris, a law and policy professor at Northeastern University, called it a sign that the agency “takes anticompetitive behavior in labor markets as seriously as it takes anticompetitive behavior in consumer product markets.”
“Huge employers merging so they can use their power to lay off workers or hold down wages is just as troubling as sellers combining to fix prices higher,” said Harris, who served as the Biden administration’s top labor adviser until 2022. “In both cases, working people are worse off.”
Kroger rejected allegations that merging with Albertsons would squeeze employees, vowing to invest $1 billion post-merger to raise wages and benefits. The companies also noted that their workforces are unionized, unlike their biggest competitors.
“This decision only strengthens larger, non-unionized retailers like Walmart, Costco and Amazon by allowing them to further increase their overwhelming and growing dominance of the grocery industry,” Kroger said in its statement. “As union membership continues to decline nationwide, especially in the grocery industry, this merger is the best way to secure union jobs.”
Other authorities share the Biden administration’s concerns about labor. A bipartisan group of attorneys general from eight states and Washington, D.C., backed the agency’s lawsuit Monday, and other state-level efforts have taken aim at the grocery chains on labor grounds.
Earlier this month, Colorado’s attorney general (who didn’t join the FTC’s effort but voiced support for it) backed local unions in a lawsuit alleging that Kroger and Albertsons had agreed not to poach each other’s employees during a strike seeking higher pay. The companies have denied the claims.
“The other retailers in the Denver area are nonunion,” Lempert noted. For regional labor leaders looking to maximize workers’ leverage, “it makes it harder to negotiate if there’s just one.”
The shadow of Walmart looms over the dispute. An FTC victory would crimp Kroger’s and Albertsons’ plan to better compete with the nation’s biggest grocer. Walmart’s stock recently hit an all-time high, and the company is now charting out plans to add more than 150 large-format stores over the next five years.
Walmart has found more success than many other big retailers in an era of inflation-fatigued consumers, including higher-income ones that have increasingly turned up searching for bargains.
But for now, “the average Walmart food shopper is very different than the average Kroger [or] Albertsons shopper,” said Lempert. The latter, he said, “wants more services, they want more prepared foods, they want a better retail experience. The average Walmart food shopper wants cheap prices.”
A geographic analysis by the mapping software provider Caliper found the merger could give Kroger greater access to younger, upwardly mobile customers in burgeoning metro areas — a cohort some experts see as a key target of Walmart’s expansion.
If the FTC prevails, “it leaves each company with some holes in their footprint,” said Michael Baker, managing director and senior research analyst at D.A. Davidson, a financial services firm. Kroger and Albertsons would “have to grow organically” while continuing as separate companies, he said, “but that becomes difficult because you have another competitor who is still in those markets.”

2024-02-05T19:12:45.686Z,Waiting for your tax refund? There are other ways to get cash back all year long,NBC News,"Inflation is slowing and consumer confidence is rising, but so is credit card debt. That’s where rewards programs can help.
Most cardholders have access to them and are taking advantage at an unprecedented rate: The six largest U.S. credit card issuers paid $67.9 billion in reward redemption and partner payments in 2022, up 24% from the year before, LendingTree found, as Americans’ spending vaulted back from pandemic lockdowns.
Unlike the one-time boost from a tax refund, experts say many of the rewards available lately — to users of credit cards, debit cards and even “buy now, pay later” loans — can provide ongoing budgetary relief.
“With high prices and high interest rates, everybody’s looking to save money,” said Ted Rossman, senior industry analyst at Bankrate. “The main message is to get money back for the things that you would have bought anyway.”
As with any credit card, it’s unwise to carry a monthly balance if you can avoid it, especially since the average interest rate for a new credit card is 24.59%, according to LendingTree. Those fees could erode any cash back to be earned.
But the perks are widely available. More than two-thirds of cardholders have access to cash back, according to a recent Morning Consult poll, and in most cases it’s the safest and least complicated form of rewards redemption, Rossman said.
Cash-back cards with no annual fees are increasingly popular, Rossman said. He pointed to the Wells Fargo Active Cash Card, which — on top of its unlimited 2% cash rewards rate — offers a $200 sign-up bonus after spending $500 within three months, plus no interest for 15 months. Its rewards redemption options are flexible: Users can cash out with a statement credit, for example, or a direct deposit into their checking or savings account.
“I might shade a little bit towards the statement credit just because then you lower your bill, and it’s just a little more seamless,” said Rossman.
The gains from rewards programs might seem incremental —  in some cases just a few dollars — but they’re one of few places many lower-income households can find relief. Among all U.S. cardholders, 75% of households earning less than $50,000 a year have reward cards, with cash back as the most common reward, Morning Consult found. Savings add up, too, especially when “stacking” card perks with existing discounts on offer.
Another popular option is the Chase Freedom Unlimited card, which lets users earn unlimited 1.5% cash back on all purchases. That rate jumps to 3% for certain spending categories that rotate quarterly, like dining and drugstores, and to 5% on travel purchases via the Chase Ultimate Rewards portal. (New cardmembers currently get a $200 bonus plus 5% on gas and grocery purchases.)
But there are some caveats. Depending on the card, redeeming points directly with a retailer can often mean less value per point than simply getting a statement credit or bank deposit, Rossman said. Plus, not every merchant qualifies. A LendingTree study last year found that while the right credit card can earn households more than $300 a year in grocery rewards, large chains such as Walmart and Costco are often excluded.
“Credit card rewards are fairly straightforward,” said Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst at LendingTree and author of the forthcoming book, “Ask Questions, Save Money, Make More: How to Take Control of Your Financial Life.” “But this is one particular instance where it can get a little bit tricky, because so many people do grocery shopping at places that aren’t exclusively grocery stores,” he said.
Schulz noted that consumers with poor credit aren’t locked out of card rewards: The highly ranked Discover Cashback Debit account, for example, offers 1% cash back on up to $3,000 in purchases each month, which can save users up to $360 per year.
Consumers can often find rewards and discounts for their recurring monthly bills, experts said.
Payment options are an easy place to start. Utilities are often looking to lower their card processing fees, and many already provide credits for setting up automatic payments. Verizon, for example, offers a $10 monthly discount to its mobile and FiOS customers who do this, but Rossman suggests comparing any potential cash-back or points rewards first.
“If I’m paying $200 a month for internet, cable and phone and I’m getting 2% cash back on a credit card, that’s only a $4 benefit,” he said, so in this case it would make sense to switch to autopay.
Buying a home is more expensive than renting one in 46 of the top 50 U.S. metro areas, but some tenants can still find some rewards in their rent payments.
The Bilt Rewards program lets anyone open an account, pay rent through its app, and earn points that can be redeemed for discounts on flights, fitness classes, rent itself or even a home down payment. In addition to its free credit-reporting feature — the company says 24 months of on-time payments can result in a 40 to 60 point credit score jump — Bilt will even send a physical check to pay your landlord, as some don’t accept electronic payments.
There are some catches with the Bilt program: If you don’t live in a Bilt-associated building, you won’t earn rewards unless you have the Bilt World Elite Mastercard credit card, which has its own stipulations. For example, users must make at least five purchases on the card per month to get rewards. (Your monthly rent payment counts.)
Even so, the Bilt card “fills a really big hole,” Rossman said. “Rent is the biggest monthly expense for so many households, and it’s not something that they’ve been able to maximize from a rewards standpoint.”
In general, Schulz said, “people have more power in these situations than they think they do,” especially by asking open-ended questions of customer service. “Instead of asking, ‘Can I get a lower interest rate on this credit card?’ you can ask, ‘Whom on your team can I speak with about potentially lowering my rate?’” he said.
While “buy now, pay later” programs come with risks of their own, consumers are flocking to the services to help extend their cash flow. Now, some providers are launching their own perks to reward users for good behavior.
Afterpay has partnered with the gift-card company Nift — which has a network of over 12,000 direct-to-consumer brands — to let customers select a gift upon making their second on-time payment. Perks range from discounts for restaurants and meal-delivery kits to gift cards for sneakers and teeth-aligners. Klarna also offers a free-to-join rewards club where users can earn a point for every dollar spent, then redeem them at a number of retailers.
These offerings are mainly designed to keep buy now, pay later customers spending, said Sheridan Trent, director of market intelligence for TSG, a consulting firm focused on electronic payments. But she said they could encourage users to avoid amassing an unwieldy number of payment plans on multiple platforms.
“It is good to give people some financial incentive to be paying it back in a responsible manner,” she said.

2024-01-31T19:46:09.389Z,Biogen to stop selling controversial Alzheimer's drug Aduhelm,NBC News,"Biogen will stop developing its Alzheimer’s treatment Aduhelm, a drug once seen as a potential blockbuster before stumbling soon after its launch a couple years ago.
The drugmaker said Wednesday that it will end a study of the drug needed for full approval from the Food and Drug Administration, and it will stop sales of Aduhelm.
Patients taking doses of Aduhelm available through the commercial market can continue until November. A company representative said there are about 2,500 people worldwide taking Aduhelm.
Biogen said it will turn its focus more to other treatments for Alzheimer’s, a fatal, mind-robbing disease. The company also is helping Japanese drugmaker Eisai sell another Alzheimer’s treatment, Leqembi, which already has full FDA approval.
Leqembi is the first medicine that’s been convincingly shown to slow the cognitive decline caused by Alzheimer’s disease, though only modestly. Regulators have approved it for patients with mild dementia and other symptoms caused by early Alzheimer’s.
Aduhelm was the first new Alzheimer’s disease drug introduced in nearly two decades. The FDA granted accelerated approval for it in 2021. But regulators required an additional study before they would consider full approval.
Initially priced at $56,000 a year, analysts predicted it would quickly become a blockbuster drug that would generate billions for Biogen.
But doctors were hesitant to prescribe the intravenous drug, given weak evidence that the drug slows Alzheimer’s. Insurers have blocked or restricted coverage, and the federal government’s Medicare program imposed strict limits on who could get it.
That proved especially challenging for Biogen because most U.S. Alzheimer’s patients are old enough to qualify for the federal program, which covers patients age 65 and older.
The drug wound up generating millions, not billions, in quarterly sales for Biogen, and the company announced in 2022 that it would largely shut down marketing of Aduhelm.
Last year, Biogen started an unsuccessful search for outside financing or partners to help with Aduhelm. That was done as part of a review the company did of its research and development program.
Biogen said it had considered during that review the time and investment that would be required for that additional study and likely advancements in the field before Aduhelm received full approval.

2024-03-12T15:03:10.850Z,Over 1 in 10 high school seniors report using delta-8 THC,NBC News,"More than 11% of high school seniors report using delta-8 THC — a compound closely related to the psychoactive chemical in marijuana that’s legal in many states thanks to a loophole in the 2018 farm bill — according to a study published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
The study, led by researchers at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California, is one of the first to offer a nationwide snapshot of teenage use of delta-8, a little-researched cannabis product with psychoactive effects that has grown in popularity in recent years.
The researchers looked at data from the Monitoring the Future survey, a nationwide survey run by the University of Michigan and funded by National Institute on Drug Abuse, which asks adolescents about substance use and attitudes toward drugs. Specifically, the researchers focused on responses from February through June 2023 about delta-8 and marijuana use from nearly 2,000 high school seniors.
Nearly 31% of the high school seniors reported having used marijuana in the past year, and more than 1 in 10 reported having used delta-8 THC.
“We know high school students naturally want to explore and try new ‘exciting’ things, like e-cigarettes, alcohol or marijuana,” said senior study author Adam Leventhal, director of the University of Southern California Institute for Addiction Science. “It’s not surprising that we’re seeing that they’re using delta-8. We just didn’t expect it to be so high.”
Delta-8 tetrahydrocannabinol is only slightly chemically different from delta-9 THC, which is the type of THC that is typically found in marijuana and what people most likely think of as responsible for the drug’s high.
Delta-8 is sometimes referred to as “diet weed” or “weed-lite,” because it’s believed to have weaker psychoactive effects than delta-9. The problem, Leventhal said, is that there isn’t enough research to say that definitively.
“There have been some trends for consumers to say online that the effects might be less robust than marijuana, but I think it’s difficult to put any credence in that at this point,” he said.
Delta-8 THC has garnered attention in recent years thanks to a loophole in the 2018 farm bill, which legalized hemp, defined as a cannabis plant that contains less than 0.3% delta-9 THC. (Hemp and marijuana are both cannabis plants; the difference between the two is how much delta-9 they contain.) The farm bill, however, made no mention of delta-8 — an omission that made it possible for vendors to sell delta-8 as long as it came from hemp plants, not marijuana plants.
“I don’t think anyone thought this was going to happen when the farm bill passed,” said Ziva Cooper, director of the Center for Cannabis and Cannabinoids at UCLA. “The genie is kind of out of the bottle at this point.”
The new study found that delta-8 use by high school seniors was higher in the South and the Midwest and in states where recreational marijuana isn’t legal. Delta-8 was also more likely to be used in states where there are no regulations on its use. It is banned or severely restricted in 24 states and Washington, D.C., according to CBD Oracle, a cannabis consumer research company.
In places without legal marijuana markets, companies may look to market delta-8 products as substitutes, Leventhal said. The same goes for the consumer, he said, who may turn to delta-8 where it’s easier to buy than marijuana.
Still, many questions remain around delta-8 THC and possible effects it may have. Compounding matters is the lack of uniformity of the products on the market: Doses can vary widely in concentration, and there’s no guarantee a product contains what’s actually on the label, experts say.
While research on delta-8 THC is limited, given its chemical similarity to delta-9, there’s reason to believe it may carry some of the same risks on the developing adolescent brain, said Dr. Scott Hadland, an addiction specialist at Mass General for Children in Boston.
“We know delta-9 THC appears to have an impact on the structure and function of the brain when young people use it heavily,” Hadland said. “It’s linked to things like early onset psychosis, risk for schizophrenia and anxiety and depression in young people.”
Delta-8 isn’t the only cannabinoid that has entered the market that has experts concerned, Cooper said.
“We don’t know very much about them, but people are using them, and they’re proliferating,” she said, referring to other synthetic cannabinoids.
Closing the loophole on delta-8 will ultimately require legislative action, Hadland said.
“We want to make sure that these products aren’t available to adolescents,” he said.  “The current situation is such that, in many states, adolescents can access these products with no age restrictions, and that’s really concerning.”

2024-03-08T11:45:41.000Z,"In an unusual move, FDA postpones approval decision for Lilly’s Alzheimer’s drug",NBC News,"The Food and Drug Administration has pushed back its approval decision deadline for Eli Lilly’s experimental Alzheimer’s drug donanemab.
Lilly applied to the FDA for approval of the drug in July, after late-stage clinical trial data showed it slowed the progression of Alzheimer’s by 29% after 18 months, compared to a placebo.
The results were comparable to those seen with Leqembi, a similar Alzheimer’s drug approved by the FDA last year.
The FDA was initially set to decide on donamemab's approval by early next week, according to a source familiar with the agency's planning.
However, in an ""unexpected"" move, it shifted gears and decided it wants input from its independent advisory committee before making a final decision, Lilly said in a statement Friday.
According to Lilly, the FDA told the company that it wants to “further understand topics” related to the drug’s safety and effectiveness. The FDA has not yet set a date for the advisory committee meeting, the statement added.
If Lilly’s drug had been approved, it would have been the third approval in the United States of a new class of Alzheimer’s drug aimed at slowing the progression of the disease. The others are Leqembi, from Japanese drugmaker Eisai and Massachusetts-based drugmaker Biogen, and Aduhelm, from Biogen.
An estimated 6.7 million Americans ages 65 and older were living with Alzheimer's in 2023, according to the Alzheimer's Association.
All three of the drugs are monoclonal antibodies that work by targeting amyloid in the brain, considered a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease.
While the medications appear to modestly slow the disease in clinical trials, they have been hampered by concerns of potentially life-threatening side effects, including brain swelling and brain bleeding.
This group of Alzheimer's drugs has long been considered controversial.
Biogen’s Aduhelm was granted an accelerated version of approval in 2021.
That approval came despite the FDA advisory committee rejecting the drug, saying that there wasn't enough evidence showing that it was effective at slowing the disease.
Later, an 18-month congressional investigation found that the FDA failed to adhere to its own standards and that its approval of Aduhelm was “rife with irregularities,” putting the agency under further scrutiny.
What’s more, Aduhelm initially cost $56,000 a year, threatening to raise Medicare premiums, before the company decided to cut that cost in half. With accelerated approval, the drug is only covered by Medicare if people are enrolled in a clinical trial.
The drug was never granted full approval by the FDA, and earlier this year the company took the drug off the market.

2024-01-12T13:00:40.000Z,Florida's plan to import cheaper drugs from Canada faces pushback — from Canada,NBC News,"The plan to allow Florida to import cheaper prescription drugs from Canada is already facing outrage from Canadians who claim it could make their own drug supply shortages worse. And experts in the U.S. have doubts the program will ever help people in Florida get a cost break on medications for conditions like heart disease and diabetes.
After years of federal efforts to lower prescription drug prices, is a shaky plan to import them from Canada the best the U.S. can do?
“The U.S. needs to solve its own drug pricing problem, and not rely on other countries to do it for them,” said Dr. Joel Lexchin, a professor emeritus at the School of Health Policy and Management at York University in Toronto.
Under a new policy the Food and Drug Administration approved last week, the Florida government will be able to purchase prescription drugs in bulk directly from wholesalers in Canada, where drugs are often cheaper than in the U.S.
“It’s almost laughable that the U.S. thinks that they’re going to solve their problems about prices with Canadian drug supply, which is already stretched to the limit,” said Dr. Jacalyn Duffin, a professor emerita of medical history and medicine at Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario.
The push to allow states to buy prescription drugs from Canada in bulk has been in the works since at least 2019, when the Trump administration launched preliminary plans.
The Biden administration has taken its own steps to lower health care and prescription drug costs, including signing the Inflation Reduction Act, which lowered the cost of insulin for people on Medicare, among other provisions. However, this is the first action by the FDA to allow mass drug importation.
On Monday, the Biden administration appointed Stacy Sanders to become the first chief competition officer in the Department of Health and Human Services, with a priority of eliminating what it calls “corporate greed” in health care.
“This work just builds on the things that we are already doing,”  Sanders said about the FDA’s move in an interview. “We’re going to continue to use any and all avenues as an agency to work to bring down prices and ramp up competition.”
Sanders didn't say whether the Canadian importation plan would make a significant dent in prescription drug prices in the U.S. Instead, she noted that the Inflation Reduction Act is a “central part” of the Biden administration's agenda.
“Our goal is really just to build on and amplify that work as much as possible,” she said.
When asked about Canada’s opposition, Sanders referred the question to the FDA.
The FDA did not respond to a request for comment.
At least eight other states — Texas, Colorado, North Dakota, Vermont, Wisconsin, Maine, New Hampshire and New Mexico — have passed similar laws, but many first need authorization from the FDA. Colorado submitted its proposal to the FDA in 2022 and said it will submit an updated proposal to the agency early this year.
The FDA rejected a proposal from New Hampshire in 2022.
While the U.S. only recently gained the authority to negotiate drug prices with drug companies, the Canadian government has been engaging in such negotiations for years, which has helped control and limit drug price increases in its country.
Since the FDA's decision, the Canadian government has been taking steps to prevent the exportation of prescription drugs to the U.S. that are in short supply, Anne Genier, a spokesperson for Health Canada, the country’s public health agency, said in a statement.
That includes, Genier said, informing wholesalers in Canada that they are obligated under the country’s law to not distribute drugs to another group “unless the person holding the license has reasonable grounds to believe that the distribution will not cause or worsen a shortage of the drug in Canada.”
“Bulk importation will not provide an effective solution to the problem of high drug prices in the U.S.,” she said.
According to Global News, a news outlet in Canada, Canadian Health Minister Mark Holland said at media conference in Nova Scotia on Wednesday that there is “no way Florida, or any other foreign jurisdiction, will be allowed to threaten Canada’s drug supply.""
Currently, 10% to 15% of drugs on the Canadian market are in short supply, Lexchin said.
Canada may not have to worry for a while, said Lawrence Gostin, director of the O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University.
That’s because, he said, Florida needs to fulfill specific criteria to start importing drugs, including providing the FDA with details about the drugs intended for import, verifying their authenticity through testing to prevent counterfeits and adjusting the labeling to align with FDA-approved standards.
Additionally, the FDA outlined that Florida must submit a quarterly report to the agency on the imported drugs. The reports, the agency said, should include information on the drugs imported, the financial savings incurred, and any safety or quality concerns that may come from the new policy.
The office for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Florida Department of Health did not respond to requests for comment.
Canada’s resistance and regulatory hurdles mean people in Florida could wait years for cheaper medications, if they get them at all, said Stacie Dusetzina, a health policy professor at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee.
“There are so many additional steps that are necessary and unwilling partners in those steps that it feels very unlikely that this would actually result in an importation of drugs in the near future or maybe ever,” she said.
AARP has pushed hard for the U.S. to allow states to import lower-priced prescription drugs.
Jeff Johnson, the state director of AARP Florida, said the state still needs to figure out its protocol for testing the prescription drugs as well as the process for relabeling the ones it plans to import from Canada.
He noted that alongside the 2019 Florida program permitting drug importation from Canada, there was another program that would have expanded the scope to include importation from a wider range of countries. That program was never implemented, he said.
“I think that if this becomes a U.S. versus Canada issue, what’s likely to happen is the discussion expands to try to look more broadly across other countries that similarly pay a whole lot less for their prescriptions than Americans,” he said.
Canada has limited options, and while the Canadian government may not directly influence U.S. policy, Lexchin from York University suggested that Canada could impose export restrictions, similar to measures European countries implemented on Covid vaccines during the pandemic.
“I don’t see a problem with imposing export restrictions,” he said. “And certainly the Canadian government has indicated that if necessary, they’ll do that.”

2024-02-16T21:22:31.564Z,FDA approves groundbreaking treatment for advanced melanoma,NBC News,"The Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved a new cancer therapy that could one day transform the way a majority of aggressive and advanced tumors are treated.
The treatment, called Amtagvi, from Iovance Biotherapeutics, is for metastatic melanoma patients who have already tried and failed other drugs. It’s known as TIL therapy and involves boosting the number of immune cells inside tumors, harnessing their power to fight the cancer.
It’s the first time a cellular therapy has been approved to treat solid tumors. The drug was given a fast-track approval based on the results of a phase 2 clinical trial. The company is conducting a larger phase 3 trial to confirm the treatment’s benefits. The therapy’s list price — the price before insurance and other potential discounts — is $515,000 per patient.
“This is going to be huge,” said Dr. Elizabeth Buchbinder, a senior physician at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. Melanoma is “not one of those cancers where there’s like 20 different” possible treatments, she said. “You start running out of options fast.”
Friday’s approval is only for melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, but experts say it holds promise for treating other solid tumors, which account for 90% of all cancers.
“It is our hope that future iterations of TIL therapy will be important for lung cancer, colon cancer, head and neck cancer, bladder cancer and many other cancer types,” said Dr. Patrick Hwu, chief executive of the Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Florida. Moffitt has been involved with Iovance’s clinical trials of TIL therapy.
TIL stands for tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, which are immune cells that exist within tumors. But there are nowhere nearly enough of those cells to effectively fight off cancer cells. TIL therapy involves, in part, extracting some of those immune cells from the patient’s tumor and replicating them billions of times in a lab, then reinfusing them back into the patient.
It’s similar to CAR-T cell therapy, where healthy cells are taken out of a person’s body and then modified in a lab to fight cancers. That’s usually used for hard-to-treat blood cancers such as leukemia and lymphoma. With TIL therapy, the cells used are already programmed to recognize cancer — no lab modifications needed — they just need a boost in numbers to fight it.
Like CAR-T, TIL therapy is a one-time treatment, though the entire process can take up to eight weeks. The TIL cells are first harvested from the tumor through a minimally invasive procedure and then grown and multiplied in the lab, a process that takes 22 days, according to Iovance.
While that’s happening, patients are given chemotherapy to clear out their immune cells to make room for the billions of new melanoma-fighting TIL cells. Once the TIL cells are reinfused back into the body, patients get a drug called interleukin-2 to further stimulate those cells.
Hwu said that most side effects in patients undergoing TIL therapy are not from the reinfusion of cells, but from the chemotherapy and the interleukin-2. These can include nausea and extreme fatigue, and patients are also vulnerable to other illnesses because the body is depleted of disease-fighting white blood cells.
Putting billions of cells back into the body is not entirely risk-free, however, said Dr. William Dahut, chief scientific officer of the American Cancer Society. It’s possible that the body’s immune system could overreact in what’s known as a cytokine storm, which can cause flu-like symptoms, low blood pressure and organ damage. “There are risks for immune-related side effects, which could be serious,” he said.
Common side effects associated with Amtagvi can include abnormally fast heart rate, fluid buildup, rash, hair loss and feeling short of breath, the FDA said.
Those side effects can be managed, said Dr. Steven Rosenberg, chief of the surgery branch at the National Cancer Institute. “They’re a small price to pay for a growing cancer that would otherwise be lethal.”
Overall, Dahut said the approval of TIL therapy is “meaningful.”
“What’s nice about this is that patients will receive a wide variety of tumor fighting lymphocytes that will be able to have the capacity to overcome resistance and actually be a living therapy over time, too, to target additional cancer cells should they develop,” Dahut said.
In addition to melanoma, Dahut said that TIL therapy is most likely to be useful in cancers that respond to drugs that “take the brakes off the immune system,” called checkpoint inhibitors.
“Those would be things like non-small cell lung cancer, kidney cancer, maybe bladder cancer, that we know are responsive to immune-based therapies to begin with,” he said. “Many of those patients relapse, so another immune-based therapy that works in a different way, seems to me, the most likely way for this to be effective.”
Much more research is needed, and it may be years before TIL therapy is approved for other types of cancer.
One of Iovance’s clinical trials investigating TIL therapy for non-small cell lung cancer was forced to pause when a participant died. While the death is under investigation, the company said it may have been the result of either chemotherapy or interleukin 2 — therapies meant to knock down each patients’ immune system before they can get the reinfusion of their TIL cells.
The therapy is not expected to work for every metastatic melanoma patient. Clinical trial data that Iovance submitted to the FDA showed that tumors shrank in about a third of patients who received TIL therapy.
Of those patients, about half saw their tumors shrink for at least one year, Dr. Friedrich Graf Finckenstein, chief medical officer of Iovance Biotherapeutics. “Some of these patients even had their tumor completely disappear,” he said.
Another study, conducted in the Netherlands, did a head-to-head analysis of TIL therapy and another form of immunotherapy, called ipilimumab. Twenty percent of the patients who received TIL had complete remissions, compared with 7% of patients who got ipilimumab. Iovance was not involved with the Dutch trial.
The goal of the therapy, Hwu said, “is to get rid of the cancer and have it stay away. These immune cells stay in the body and live in the body for decades.”
The technology has been in development and studied for nearly 40 years. It was Rosenberg who pioneered TIL therapy — first describing how it could shrink melanoma tumors in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1988.
“I’ve been waiting for a very long time to see this given to patients, because I know that it can cure some patients that have metastatic melanoma that cannot be affected by any other treatment,” Rosenberg said.
It’s worked so far for Dan Bennett, 59, of Clermont, Florida. Bennett was diagnosed with melanoma in 2011 after his daughter noticed a suspicious mole on his neck that had changed color.
Despite surgery, chemotherapy and radiation, his cancer kept returning. In 2014, his doctors at Moffitt recommended he try TIL therapy.
“At first, we were pretty leery about it because it was unproven,” Bennett said. Ten years later, Bennett is convinced the TIL therapy is the reason he has survived so long with stage 4 melanoma, which usually has a five-year survival rate of 22.5%.
“I would recommend any experimental drug if it’s your last opportunity,” he said. “You owe it to yourself and your family to do whatever you can to stay alive and to be a productive member of society.”
Buchbinder, the Dana-Faber doctor, was not involved with Iovance’s TIL therapy trial for melanoma, but she is scheduled to begin similar trials with other drugmakers.
“We literally have patients right now waiting for approval because they are hoping they’ll be able to go on it,” Buchbinder said. “It is definitely a practice-changing therapy.”

2024-02-10T13:10:40.000Z,How to get back on track with your New Year’s resolutions,NBC News,"Six weeks into 2024, many of us are already feeling behind on the New Year’s resolutions we set.
According to a survey of more than 5,000 U.S. adults conducted by the Pew Research Center last month, 41% of those who made resolutions had already called it quits on some or all of those goals.
“Just because you fell off the trail of your resolution pursuit doesn’t mean you can’t get back on,” said Deborah Carr, a sociology professor at Boston University. “If you failed in January, it doesn’t mean you’re a failure.”
NBC News asked seven experts — registered dietitians and professors of psychology, sociology or behavioral science — for their suggestions about how to get back on track. Their advice: Refine your goals to be specific and achievable, make your resolutions fun by incorporating things you already enjoy, link up with an accountability buddy or perhaps forgo New Year’s resolutions altogether.
Here are some research-backed strategies to try for the rest of the year.
Setting too broad a goal for the new year is a recipe for failure, said Ayelet Fishbach, a professor of behavioral science and marketing at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.
Resolutions like “I want to exercise more” can feel overwhelming to maintain because there’s no objective way to track progress, Fishbach said. Instead, she suggested, narrow your exercise goals to working out for 150 minutes a week or going to the gym three times weekly.
“Without any specifics, it’s hard to feel empowered by what you did or motivated by what you still need to do because you never quite set a number,” Fishbach said. “So set a resolution where you can know where you stand.”
Research suggests that keeping track of progress can help people stick to goals. A 2021 review of studies involving older adults and patients with chronic diseases found that monitoring progress was key to exercising consistently. Meanwhile, a 2015 review involving nearly 20,000 participants found that tracking progress increased the likelihood of succeeding at goals such as quitting smoking, losing weight or changing diets.
Many people set resolutions in pursuit of long-term goals like improving overall health or fitness, Fishbach said. But to keep up with a goal, she said, enjoying the process is more important than focusing on the desired result.
“We are able to think about the future more than any other animal, as far as we know. So we do plan for the future, but we are still animals,” Fishbach said. “We still live in the present.”
Wendy Wood, a professor emerita of psychology at the University of Southern California who researches how habits guide behavior, said her knees and back weakened with age, so she bought herself an elliptical machine to incorporate low-impact cardio into her routine. But using the elliptical was painfully boring, she said, and as a result “it turned into a clothes hanger for a long time.”
To get back on track, Wood began watching “trashy TV shows” while she exercised.
“It made working out on the elliptical fun,” Wood said. “I was able to add something to it that made it more enjoyable, and I started repeating it, and I now use it regularly.”
Research backs that up: A 2020 study followed people in Norway who had recently joined fitness clubs. After one year, the participants who exercised regularly were more likely to report that they enjoyed the feeling of exercise compared to those who didn’t exercise consistently.
Fishbach’s 2016 analysis also found that while people who pursued long-term goals like improved health may at first be motivated by future rewards, immediate rewards like enjoying a workout were more strongly associated with persistence toward a goal. Another study of hers from the same year found that gym-goers who chose the most enjoyable weightlifting exercises completed more sets than those who chose the weightlifting exercises they found most effective for their health goals.
Making resolutions fun doesn’t apply only to fitness goals, said Patricia Bannan, a registered dietitian. Bannan said experimenting with healthy recipes can make nutrition-related goals more enjoyable.
“I do a recipe where you just open a date, you add some peanut butter or some nut butter in there, you can even put a little dark chocolate on top, you put them in the fridge. It tastes like a Snickers bar,” she said.
Experts agree that it’s also helpful to have someone hold you to a resolution.
Hengchen Dai, an associate professor of organizational behavior and behavioral decision-making at the UCLA Anderson School of Management, said her goal is to be asleep before 12 a.m.
She typically succeeds if she stops work and turns off her computer by 11 p.m., she said. That gives her enough time to get ready for bed by 11:30 p.m. and be asleep before the clock strikes midnight. But when she loses track of time, she said, her daughter reminds her of her goal.
“She’ll say: ‘Mama, don’t forget to sleep. Turn off your PC,’” Dai said.
Some studies suggest that having someone hold your feet to the fire is associated with increased chances of success. A 2018 study in North Carolina found that people who had “buddies” during weight loss programs lost more weight and reduced their body mass indexes and waist sizes more than those without buddies. Those who perceived their buddies as attentive, caring and encouraging saw the largest reductions in BMI and waist size.
Another 2018 study in Chile found that people who had peers holding them accountable for saving money deposited money into savings accounts more than three times as often as those who didn’t have anyone holding them to it.
“People really need the support and encouragement of others to set themselves up for success,” Carr said.
Don’t feel pressured to pursue long-term goals just because it’s the start of a new year, Dai said. Her research suggests that people are also motivated to chase goals after events such as birthdays, anniversaries, holidays or simply the start of a new week or month.
Dai calls that the “fresh start effect.” People are more likely to pursue goals after special time markers because they feel separated from their past mistakes, which can feel like a blank slate, she said.
Wood said the top of a new year isn’t necessarily the best time to make a goal if nothing in your life has changed recently. She said she doesn’t set New Year’s resolutions.
Forming new habits is easiest when you’re in a new environment because you haven’t settled into a routine yet, she said.
In that sense, Wood said, it may be easier to set goals after moving homes, starting new relationships or jobs, taking vacations or transferring schools.
“That’s why it’s tiring when we move. We have to find a dry cleaner, we have to figure out where’s the best grocery store, we have to make all these decisions. But it’s an opportunity,” she said. “That’s the best time to try to change your behavior to make resolutions, because the old habits aren’t constantly being activated and competing with your new resolution.”

2024-01-25T22:59:16.879Z,Evidence mounts that Covid in pregnancy can cause health issues in babies,NBC News,"Just over four years since Covid emerged, it has become increasingly clear that infections in pregnant mothers can lead to serious health risks in infants.
The latest finding: Babies born to mothers who had Covid during pregnancy had ""unusually high rates"" of respiratory distress at birth or shortly thereafter, according to a study published Wednesday in the journal Nature Communications.
The authors defined respiratory distress as having at least two out of four symptoms: a slow breathing rate, pale or bluish skin, flaring nostrils or a retraction of the chest with each breath.
The study enrolled 221 pregnant women with Covid — mostly Black or Hispanic women in Los Angeles. None of the nearly 200 babies studied, who were born between April 2020 and August 2022, tested positive for Covid at birth. Around 17% were diagnosed with respiratory distress — higher than the average among newborns, which estimates put around 5% to 7%.
""The average duration of a hospital stay for these infants was about 24 days. They were quite sick,"" said Dr. Olivia Man, the lead author of the study.
Other effects of Covid during pregnancy, according to prior research, include an increased risk of severe illness and death for the mother, preterm birth, stillbirth and neurodevelopmental issues in the first year of a child’s life.
A 2022 study on those developmental issues found that Covid during pregnancy was associated with delayed speech or motor skills, though the link isn’t fully understood. A follow-up study found that the association was only statistically significant in male babies, while another study found no association at all.
""We don’t know if these early speech and motor delays will go on to be matched by later neurodevelopmental diagnoses like autism or ADHD,"" said Dr. Andrea Edlow, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital who conducted some of that research.
These risks aren’t exclusive to Covid. Having the flu during pregnancy increases the odds of preterm birth and birth defects, and some studies have also linked bacterial and viral infections during pregnancy to a risk of autism and depression in children.
""There are various infections that affect fetuses in different ways, but we’ve not had something like this that has affected a generation all at the same time,"" said Dr. Shahnaz Duara, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine.
""Twenty years from now, the kids who were born during the pandemic, we will be looking at them in a different way,"" she said. ""Because it’s not the odd kid here and there — it’s waves upon waves upon waves of women who have had Covid during pregnancy.""
In the new study, the timing of a mother’s infection didn’t seem to have an effect on whether a baby experienced respiratory issues, but her vaccination status did. Infants born to unvaccinated mothers had three times the odds of respiratory distress than those whose moms had received at least one mRNA vaccine dose.
As for why babies exposed to Covid in the womb may develop health issues, inflammation is the leading hypothesis.
When a pregnant person gets Covid, their body may ramp up the production of cytokines — proteins involved in the immune response — that trigger inflammation. This could increase inflammation in their baby as well.
It’s possible that these inflammatory proteins cross the placenta. But the experts interviewed said the likelier explanation is that a mother’s inflammation activates immune cells in the placenta, which then activate immune cells in the infant.
Dr. Mary Prahl, an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco said there appears to be ""some sort of signaling on the infant side that’s saying, 'Hey, something’s wrong. Let’s release all of our cytokines and our inflammatory markers to fight what’s happening.'""
Indeed, the new study found elevated levels of inflammatory proteins in blood samples taken from the newborns.
""What we think is happening is that Covid creates this sort of inflammatory cascade in the mother, and that these infants are responding to their mother’s own inflammation,"" said Man, who conducted the research as a medical student at the University of California, Los Angeles.
""The risk of transmitting the actual virus in utero from mother to child is very low,"" she added.
Man’s study found, in particular, that the inflammatory response in infants disrupted the normal function of cilia — hairlike structures that remove pathogens or particulate matter from the lungs.
""The implications would be that these children may be less likely to clear future infections or they may have significant difficulty breathing later in life,"" she said.
In theory, Man added, long-term consequences could include asthma. Her study also found elevated levels of an antibody called immunoglobulin E, which have been linked to allergies. But more research is needed.
Of course, not all babies whose mothers get Covid in pregnancy experience negative outcomes.
""We certainly don’t want to scare pregnant people,"" Edlow said.
Premature birth can raise the risk of developmental delays and breathing issues on its own — though 38% of the babies with respiratory distress in Man’s study were born full term.
Edlow noted, as well, that infants born between 37 and 39 weeks still have an increased risk of mild respiratory distress, so ""it would be very hard to tease apart how much of that is actually due to some inflammation in the neonates that’s from Covid.""
Covid vaccines are safe at any point in pregnancy, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention doesn’t specify an ideal trimester.
Duara said protection from vaccines tends to wane after four to six months, so she suggested that ""somewhere between 12 and 18 weeks is probably a good time to get it because you will still have immunity by the time your baby’s born.""
Getting vaccinated during pregnancy, she added, tends to give newborns higher antibody levels than a Covid infection in pregnancy does, so even pregnant mothers who get Covid should get the shot if eligible.
""If it’s time for you to get another booster, take it,"" Duara said.
Edlow, meanwhile, said research suggests that vaccinating mothers in the early third trimester maximizes the antibody levels transferred to babies, though she cautioned against waiting for that reason.
""If you’ve never been vaccinated, you shouldn’t be trying to time your Covid vaccine to optimize antibody protection for your neonate,"" she said. ""You should be thinking about yourself.""

2024-02-10T17:33:52.125Z,"As Biden’s memory issues draw attention, neurologists weigh in",NBC News,"Since a report released on Thursday by special counsel Robert Hur described President Joe Biden as an “elderly man with a poor memory,” there have been significant misperceptions about the cognitive changes associated with aging, neurologists say.
The report on Biden’s handling of classified documents noted that the president hadn’t remembered the exact time frame that he served as vice president and was struggling to recall the period when his late son, Beau Biden, had passed away. Biden defiantly rejected the changes in a press conference late Thursday, saying “my memory’s fine.”
There’s also been scrutiny of other recent events when the 81-year-old president mixed up names of foreign leaders.
However, neurologists say blanking on the names of acquaintances or having difficulty remembering dates from the past, especially when under stress, can simply be part of normal aging.
“If you asked me when my mother passed away, I couldn’t necessarily tell you the exact year because it was many years ago,” Dr. Paul Newhouse, clinical core leader for the Vanderbilt Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center, said.
Almost every older patient has trouble remembering people’s names, Newhouse said.
“I think it’s by far the most universal complaint of every person as they age,” Newhouse said.
In Newhouse's experience, this type of forgetfulness doesn’t actually predict who ends up having memory disorders. Only a person’s doctor or neurologist can make that diagnosis, not outside observers, brain experts say.
Dr. Dennis Selkoe, co-director of the Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, agreed that forgetting names doesn’t actually provide much insight into potential memory problems. In fact, stress and a lack of sleep, can interfere with memory, no matter how old someone is.
“Naming proper nouns is not an adequate basis to make a conclusion about whether an individual has a more consistent and more concerning substantive progressive memory disorder,” Selkoe said.
It’s normal for older brains to have more difficulty retaining new information and then retrieving the information, but mental processes like decision-making and judgment can actually improve with age, said Dr. Thomas Wisniewski, director of NYU Langone Health’s Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center and its Center for Cognitive Neurology.
“Although the raw power of memory has some degree of decline, perhaps wisdom can increase because the individual has a greater backlog of experiences and different situations as to what is the best thing to do,” Wisniewski said.
The problem isn’t having trouble remembering names or calling someone by the wrong name, but when someone’s memory is fuzzy about recent or past experiences, said Newhouse. Issues with episodic memory — memory for events in time or if a person doesn’t remember going shopping, for example — can be a sign of a progressive disorder, but not always.
Wisniewski said he becomes concerned when people don’t even recognize that they are forgetting things.
“They forgot that they went shopping and they’re unaware that they’ve forgotten,” he said.
Overall, neurologists tend to worry less about a patient’s ability to remember remote memories from many years ago and more troubled by an inability to recall more recent events. That’s because dementia first affects the part of the brain that’s responsible for short-term memories, as opposed to long-term memories, said Newhouse.
“What I’m more concerned about is, can you remember what happened yesterday? Or an hour ago?” Newhouse said.
While the conversation surrounding aging is often framed around a person’s diminishing memory or executive functioning, there are cognitive benefits that come with growing older, Selkoe said.
“There is a type of emotional intelligence and ability to handle many different kinds of experiences in life that come with greater longevity,” he said. “People can make decisions more carefully and more rationally.”

2024-01-18T22:36:57.628Z,"N.Y. midwife fined for giving 1,500 children homeopathic pellets instead of vaccines",NBC News,"A New York midwife has been fined $300,000 for giving homeopathic pellets to 1,500 children instead of their required vaccinations for diseases like hepatitis, measles and polio.
The penalty, announced by the state's Department of Health on Wednesday, came after an investigation found that Jeanette Breen had entered nearly 12,500 false vaccine records into New York's Immunization Information System since 2019.
It's the first settlement of its kind for a scheme to create false immunization records, the department said.
The pellets Breen administered were taken orally as a series and supplied by an out-of-state homeopath, the department said in a  release. They are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration or Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as an immunizing agent.
Erin Clary, a public information officer with New York's health department, said the nature of the scheme suggests that the affected children's parents or guardians ""sought out and paid Breen related to their children’s immunizations and immunization records,"" but that the parents or guardians were not the subject of the investigation.
Breen told NBC News that she had no comment. Her attorney David Ekew wrote in an email that when Breen was informed of the investigation, she ""fully cooperated.""
""She paid the fine, entered into the stipulation of settlement and intends to fully comply with the requirements of the agreement. From her perspective, this matter is over, done with, and closed and she is now moving on with her life,"" Ekew said.
The children whose vaccine records were falsified ranged in age from around 4 to 18 and attended 300 different schools, mostly in Long Island where Breen practiced. Their immunization records have been voided, so they will have to receive all the required vaccinations before returning to the classroom.
None of the fake records were for Covid vaccines. Rather, the list included tetanus, hepatitis B, chickenpox and the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) shot, among others.
By law, New York requires health care providers to submit accurate vaccination information to its immunization system. In 2019, the state eliminated religious and other nonmedical exemptions to vaccine mandates for schoolchildren, following a series of major measles outbreaks that sickened more than 1,100 people. Breen’s falsification scheme appears to have started several months after New York’s rule changed.
Currently, a measles outbreak in Philadelphia has led nine people to be diagnosed. None had immunity, meaning they either never got vaccinated or had not contracted measles before.
Dr. Arthur Caplan, head of the division of medical ethics at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine, said he had heard of Breen before the penalty was announced because her name was mentioned in Facebook groups where users discussed how to dodge vaccination requirements.
""I saw people saying, 'If you want to avoid a vaccination but still be able to send your kids to school, go here,'"" Caplan said. ""She put so many people at risk for communicable diseases by lying.""
Breen has paid $150,000 of her fine. The rest was suspended, contingent on her compliance with state laws and the terms of the agreement, which prohibits her from accessing the New York State Immunization Information System and from administering any vaccine that would be reported there.
But Caplan said the state should go further.
“She has been found guilty and fined a huge amount for lying and promoting quackery so her license should go,” he said. “She’s dishonest and putting innocent people at risk.”
Eskew did not comment on questions about whether Breen should lose her license.
The New York State Education Department, which is responsible for prosecuting misconduct among medical professionals — including the loss of a license  — said it could not comment on Breen’s case for confidentiality reasons.
The New York State Association of Licensed Midwives denounced the vaccine fraud in a statement, saying it opposes ""any actions that harm the public and stands firm against outliers in our profession who operate outside clinical and moral standards.""
""It is the hope that the recent news stories concerning one NYS midwife will not detract from the vital work that over a thousand NYS midwives are doing every day,"" it added.
Although Breen's penalty is a first in New York, a California doctor was arrested in 2021 for falsifying Covid vaccination records after administering similar homeopathic pellets.

2024-03-01T20:36:59.881Z,CVS and Walgreens to start dispensing the abortion pill mifepristone,NBC News,"CVS and Walgreens announced on Friday that they will soon start dispensing mifepristone, one of the two drugs used for medication abortions, in states where abortion is allowed.
The two large pharmacy chains said they had received certification to dispense mifepristone, following a rule change the Food and Drug Administration finalized in January 2023.
The FDA decision broadened the availability of abortion pills by allowing pharmacies to dispense them to patients in person or or by mail, though neither CVS nor Walgreens are sending the medication by mail yet. Previously, patients were required to pick up the medication in person at a clinic, medical office or hospital.
Mifepristone is the first of two pills used in medication abortions. The second is misoprostol.
The FDA policy still requires pharmacies to meet certain requirements and complete a set of forms to get certified to sell mifepristone — that's the process CVS and Walgreens have completed.
Walgreens said it will begin dispensing mifepristone pills within a week — consistent with state laws — in select locations in California, Illinois, Massachusetts, New York and Pennsylvania.
“We are beginning a phased rollout in select locations to allow us to ensure quality, safety, and privacy for our patients, providers, and team members,” Walgreens said in a statement.
CVS said it is “working with manufacturers and suppliers to secure the medication and are not yet dispensing it” in any of their pharmacies.
The statement added that pharmacies will begin to fill prescriptions in Massachusetts and Rhode Island in the “weeks ahead,” then “will expand to additional states, where allowed by law, on a rolling basis.”
CVS and Walgreens said mifepristone will be only dispensed at their physical pharmacy locations, though Walgreens added that home delivery via a courier service will be available for customers at select locations in accordance with state and federal laws.
Pharmacies in states where abortion is banned will not sell mifepristone.
Medication abortion made up more than half of all U.S. abortions in 2020, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that advocates for abortion access.
Following the CVS and Walgreens announcements, President Joe Biden issued a statement praising the change.
“With major retail pharmacy chains newly certified to dispense medication abortion, many women will soon have the option to pick up their prescription at a local, certified pharmacy—just as they would for any other medication,” Biden said. “I encourage all pharmacies that want to pursue this option to seek certification.”
CVS and Walgreens’ announcements come as the Supreme Court is poised to hear oral arguments in March in a high-stakes case that takes aim at FDA policies that have expanded access to mifepristone in recent years. It will be the first significant abortion case before the Supreme Court since its decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization overturned the constitutional right to abortion.

2024-01-13T12:00:00.000Z,"As new the Covid variant surges, what to know about testing and accuracy",NBC News,"The U.S. is currently in the midst of a Covid wave, fueled by the JN.1 variant that’s driving up hospitalizations and deaths across the country. For most people, however, the new variant doesn’t seem to be causing worse symptoms.
That’s left many wondering whether we need to keep swabbing our nasal passages with Covid tests at the first sign of congestion or achiness? How well do at-home rapid tests work against the new variant?
Here’s what to know:
Influenza and some cold viruses are circulating along with Covid. So there are good reasons to know which virus you’ve got, particularly if you are at higher risk of getting really sick.
“It’s important to know if you have Covid versus the flu versus something that’s not viral at all — like strep throat — because they have different treatments,” said Dr. Abraar Karan, an infectious disease physician at Stanford Medicine. “They have different treatments, and the sooner you get treated the better outcome you’ll have.”
For a healthy 25-year-old, there is still some utility in getting tested. If somebody in the home has a weak immune system or is fighting cancer, for example, it’s important to isolate if it’s Covid.
“Remember for all these viruses or bacterial infections, contagiousness is different and how sick you may get is different.” Karan said.
Joseph Petrosino, a chair of molecular biology and microbiology at Baylor College of Medicine, acknowledged that while it may not be as necessary for young, healthy people to take an at-home test, it can be helpful to know if it’s Covid in case someone ends up with lingering symptoms.
“There are healthy people, runners or people who work out, who do get long Covid as well,” he said. “You just really never know — it’s hard to predict just based on comorbidity factors alone.”
Otherwise, for someone who is low-risk, getting a positive Covid test won’t change much about treatment. Whether it’s Covid, a cold or flu, get plenty of rest, hydration and stay away from others.
There is no data that the JN.1 variant should have any effect on the results of an at-home rapid test, experts say.
“I have not seen anything to suggest that the newer variants have evaded detection on tests,” said Karan. “Certainly this has happened in the past with other diagnostics earlier in the pandemic, but at this point the tests should pick up these variants.”
Susan Butler-Wu, a clinical pathologist at Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California, said that while she hasn’t seen data for this specific variant, if it’s anything like other variants, it won’t be an issue. Rapid tests actually look for a part of the virus that is less likely to mutate and dodge the tests.
“There’s always this fear that we’re going to have some mutation that’s now going to make the tests not work, but so far that’s not really the case,” said Butler-Wu.
In the early days of the pandemic, before most people had some kind of immunity either after infection or from the vaccines, an individual’s viral load would be highest when symptoms first appeared.
Now, the levels of virus may actually be highest a few days into the illness, according to a study published last fall in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases from researchers at Harvard Medical School. They found that in those with pre-existing immunity, the level of virus peaks around the fourth day of symptoms.
This means that if someone tests too early in the illness, it may show up negative.
“Their symptoms could be caused by their immune response,” Karan said. “So you’re getting some inflammation and that’s causing symptoms, and that’s also preventing the virus from building up quite as fast, and so your initial test could be negative.”
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still recommends testing immediately if you believe you’ve been exposed to Covid and are showing symptoms such as congestion, cough or body aches.
If you’ve been exposed but don’t have any symptoms, the CDC says to wait five days.
There is a misconception that rapid tests are “one and done,” says Butler-Wu.
“If you’re symptomatic and the first one is negative, you need to repeat it,” she said.
The official guidance from the CDC is that if you have symptoms, take a rapid test, and if it’s negative repeat it 48 hours later.
At-home rapid tests are a good way to know if someone is contagious.
Simply put, rapid tests require a higher level of virus to turn positive, and higher levels of virus typically mean somebody is more contagious.
There are some limitations to the tests, however.
Karan said that while early on in the course of the illness they can be good proxies for contagiousness, they aren’t as reliable at the end of an illness.
There is data where rapid tests were positive, but when they got people’s samples, the virus couldn't be cultured — meaning that those people were unlikely to be contagious, Karan said.
A 2022 study from researchers at Harvard Medical School suggested that only half of people who test positive after five days are actually contagious.
“After that time period, if your rapid test is positive it’s not a guarantee you’re still contagious.”

2024-02-08T19:16:08.588Z,CDC report finds teens use drugs — often alone — to ease stress and anxiety,NBC News,"Teenagers with suspected substance use problems say they turn to drugs because of a crushing need to relax and escape worries, according to research published Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The new findings follow reports of rising anxiety and depression among the nation's youth, including unprecedented levels of hopelessness.
Because those conditions are often linked to substance use in adolescence, said Sarah Connolly, lead author of the new report and an epidemic intelligence service officer within the CDC's Division of Overdose Prevention, ""it might make sense that teens are looking for ways to reduce stress and anxiety.""
Connolly's study, the first of its kind, expands on limited research previously done on why kids use drugs. It is based on data from the National Addictions Vigilance Intervention and Prevention Program. It includes self-assessments from 15,963 teenagers, ages 13 to 18, who answered questions online about their motivations for drug and alcohol use from 2014 through 2022.
The findings do not reflect why teenagers might experiment with drugs for the first time; all were flagged for substance use disorder and subsequent treatment.
Nearly three-quarters — 73% — said they used ""to feel mellow, calm or relaxed."" Forty-four percent used drugs, such as marijuana, as sleep aides.
The same percentage cited drug use as a way to ""stop worrying about a problem or forget bad memories."" And 40% said they used to cope with depression or anxiety.
Dr. Leslie Walker-Harding, chief academic officer and senior vice president at Seattle Children's Hospital, said that 75% of young people with a substance use disorder also have a mental health condition.
""We know that the two go together,"" she said. ""If you have a kid who you think might not be using very much, but say they're using to feel less depressed or to stop worrying, that's a really big warning sign"" that they need help.
The findings are consistent with previous research and point to an ongoing need for mental health services that target kids.
It's important to understand why teens use or misuse drugs, so the right resources and education can help them, Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, wrote in an email.
""Early prevention interventions are crucial to support teens who may turn to drug use to cope with stress, anxiety or depression,"" Volkow said. Neither Volkow nor Walker-Harding were involved with the new research.
The majority — 84% — used a form of marijuana. This comes amid growing evidence linking cannabis use and psychotic disorders.
Less than half (49%) said they drank alcohol and 19% of surveyed teens reported misusing prescription drugs like pain relievers and sedatives.
""We worry about kids using cannabis, alcohol and nicotine because we know long term, it's going to take a toll on their mental health and their physical health,"" said Dr. Sharon Levy, chief of the Division of Addiction Medicine at Boston Children's Hospital. ""What's really scary is the opioids, because the consequences of opioid use are immediate and can be fatal."" Levy was not involved with the CDC report.
Half of the teens said they did drugs by themselves, without anyone else around — greatly increasing their risk for deadly overdoses, ""especially given the proliferation of counterfeit pills resembling prescription drugs and containing illegal drugs,"" the study authors wrote.
""Parents need to know this,"" Walker-Harding said. ""A lot of kids, when they die and overdose in their home, they're in their room and nobody saw it happening.""
Addiction experts, including those at the CDC, urge parents and caregivers to educate kids about the risks of using drugs alone. That includes providing naloxone to reverse opioid overdoses.
""Sometimes people perceive that this is a hard conversation. It's only hard because of our own internal difficulty with it,"" Walker-Harding said. ""Kids will talk if they think somebody's willing to listen.""
Levy advised examining the culture of drugs and alcohol in the U.S.: ""If you're happy, drink to celebrate. If you're stressed, drink to relax. Oh my gosh, this candidate that I don't like is winning. I better go have a drink.""
""You hear that all the time. This is the soup kids are swimming in,"" she said. ""Parents are one of the very few potential places for counterbalance.""

2024-02-08T19:53:46.356Z,Fungus that sparked deadly meningitis outbreak aggressively attacked the brainstem,NBC News,"The fungus behind a spate of deadly meningitis cases last year linked to medical clinics in Mexico was found to have aggressively attacked the base of patients’ brains, researchers said Wednesday in a report published in The New England Journal of Medicine.
Fungal meningitis was reported in as many as 24 patients from the United States who visited two medical clinics in Matamoros, Mexico. Many came from Texas. Twelve died.
All of the patients had undergone cosmetic procedures — such as breast implants, butt lifts or liposuction — that required epidural anesthesia. It was later discovered that the epidural was contaminated with a fungus called Fusarium solani; the epidural, experts said, introduced the fungus into the patients’ cerebrospinal fluid, a liquid found in and around the spinal cord and brain that provides nourishment and protection and removes waste.
In the report, researchers from the University of Texas System and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scrutinized the electronic health records, imaging and pathology reports of 13 of the patients. They found that the fungus, which has a predilection for sticking to blood vessels, was rampant in the vessel-rich brainstem.
“What we ended up seeing is, literally, this fungus eating through blood vessels and causing clotting as well,” said Dr. Luis Ostrosky, division director of infectious diseases at UTHealth Houston and one of the paper’s authors.
As a result, patients suffered strokes, brain hemorrhages and increased pressure within the brain as inflammation blocked the flow of the spinal fluid.
“Seeing how the brain stem was impacted in very specific ways, which were unexpected and unusual, is an important finding and potentially could help alert clinicians to future cases” and lead to better and quicker diagnosis and treatment, said Dr. Celeste Philip, the senior public health adviser of health and medical affairs at the American Public Health Association. Philip was not involved with the new report.
Getting treatment early is critical, said Dr. Katrina Byrd, an infectious disease expert and epidemic intelligence officer at the CDC. “If we can catch infection early, the length of the treatment is shorter and the effect of the infection on the body is less severe,” she said.
Many of the patients in the Matamoros outbreak were not evaluated and treated for a month or more after the onset of meningitis symptoms, such as chronic headache, light and sound sensitivity and fever. Some were turned away from emergency departments and were told that they probably had post-epidural headaches. Others, some without health insurance, ignored their symptoms.
Six of the surviving patients received an experimental antifungal drug late in the outbreak after it was discovered through lab tests that the fungal strain was resistant to current drugs, said Dallas Smith, an epidemiologist with the Mycotic Diseases Branch in the CDC’s National Center for Zoonotic and Emerging Infectious Diseases, who led the agency’s efforts on the outbreak. A seventh patient also received the drug but died.
He noted that it is difficult to grow the fungus in the lab from spinal fluid; the sample that was successfully cultured came from the brain of a patient who had died.
Survivors, as well as some who died, also received steroids for inflammation, shunts to divert backed-up spinal fluid and other advanced treatments to address the attack on the brainstem.
It remains unclear exactly how the fungus entered the epidural solution at the Matamoros clinics, but the CDC has a theory. The morphine that was mixed with the anesthesia most likely was contaminated, said Smith.
Because of drug shortages, morphine is hard to come by in Mexico, and so the anesthesiologist, who moved between both clinics, likely purchased it on the black market, said Smith, who was an author on the new report.
Several weeks ago, the CDC was able to grow the Fusarium fungus from the spinal fluid of a patient in Tennessee and compare it to the fungus cultured last year from the brain autopsy. The two patients had each visited a different clinic, yet the strains were genetically almost identical. That finding supports the theory that the fungus was introduced into the epidural by contaminated morphine and not poor hygiene during surgery, Smith said.
Either way, the fungus was directly delivered into the epidural space of the spine, “and that’s why we got this devastating mortality rate,” he said.
Despite the unusual and severe nature of the outbreak, experts warned that there are likely more to come.
“This is probably not our last fungal outbreak,” said Ostrosky, who is also chief of infectious diseases and epidemiology at Memorial Hermann Health System in Houston. A similar outbreak occurred in Durango, Mexico, at the end of 2022.
Clinicians should ask patients with symptoms of meningitis, which can be caused by bacteria, a virus or fungi, about their recent medical history, said Smith.
“Do they have exposure to epidurals? Do they have a recent history of medical tourism?” Smith said. If the answers are “yes,” then the patients should be tested for fungal meningitis, he said.
Byrd offered several tips for people who are considering going abroad for medical treatment, where it can be less expensive than in the U. S. These include:
“Even if you’re not having symptoms, a good plan of care is, upon your return, to check in with a health care provider,” Byrd said.

2024-01-17T17:23:57.552Z,"When to come out of Covid isolation, according to experts",NBC News,"Covid symptoms may change, but the appearance of a pink line on a rapid test means one thing for sure: five days of isolation.
The guidance, from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has been in place since late 2021. At the moment, the agency doesn’t appear to be making any changes to the policy.
But in some cases, telling people to isolate after a positive test may have an unintended effect.
Dr. Victoria Valencia, interim director for the Health Center for Student Care at Tulane University in New Orleans, said that she and her staff saw an uptick in Covid when students returned to campus in August. But that is no longer the case, as students now tend to decline Covid testing.
“Students are afraid of being diagnosed with Covid” because they don’t want to isolate, Valencia said.
So is five days of isolation really best? Here’s what experts say.
The current recommendation to isolate for five days is a “hangover” from when the CDC moved from a 10-day isolation recommendation to five days in late 2021, just as the first wave of omicron was taking hold in the U.S., said Harvard University epidemiologist Bill Hanage.
“It was not a reflection of evidence-based” science, he said. “It was there to stop everything from falling apart.”
At that time, a large chunk of the population was testing positive all at once because of the highly contagious variant. Recommending that everyone stay home — and out of work — for 10 days would have brought the country to a halt once again, so the five-day plan was put in place.
“If you look at the safety of the public, and the need to have society not disrupted, this was a good choice,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, former scientific adviser to the Biden administration, said at the time about the isolation recommendation.
There was also evidence that people are most contagious during those first five days of infection. That remains the most reliable scientific data, experts say.
“We know that most people with Covid-19 shed enough virus that they are likely still contagious for at least five days,” Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University School of Public Health, wrote in an email.
When the Covid public health emergency expired in May 2023, health officials in Oregon decided it was also time to pull back on the five-day isolation recommendation. Instead, the Oregon Health Authority suggested that people with Covid stay home only until they’ve gone without spiking a fever for 24 hours and are generally feeling better.
In January of this year, California health officials issued the same guidance.
“The ending of the public health emergency declaration doesn’t change biology,” Nuzzo said when Oregon changed its isolation recommendations. “I don’t see a biological reason to end the five-day isolation period.”
People with the flu are most contagious the first three or four days after the illness begins, according to the CDC. People who test positive for influenza are advised to stay home “until at least 24 hours after their fever is gone” without the use of fever-reducing drugs, such as Tylenol.
A common cold virus is most contagious within the first few days but can continue to spread for up to two weeks, according to Johns Hopkins All Children’s Hospital research.
Like other viruses, people with Covid have varying degrees of sickness.
A set number of days to isolate is “dumb if you think about it from a medical perspective,” said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious diseases specialist at the University of California, San Francisco.
“If you’re feeling fine the entire five days and have absolutely no symptoms, staying at home by yourself is not the same as somebody who’s had symptoms and then after five days, they’re going out and coughing on everyone,” Chin-Hong said. “The symptoms approach makes more sense, not just for Covid, but for lots of other infectious diseases that people don’t normally isolate for.”
Saskia Popescu, an assistant professor of epidemiology and public health at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, said that while a person’s risk of spreading Covid is in the first five days of infection, “we know increasingly, that even without symptoms, or upon their resolution, people can still shed infectious virus.”
Popescu said that means that while the risk is lower after Day 5, it doesn’t mean there’s zero risk. “You should still try and stay home,” she said. “And if you absolutely need to, you can wear a mask.”
“Covid is a very unique infectious disease,” Popescu added. “Forty to 50% of cases are asymptomatic, or have such mild symptoms that people don’t even realize they have symptoms.”
In a study published in JAMA Pediatrics in October, researchers found that children ages 7 to 18 were infectious for a median of three days after a positive Covid test. By Day 5, the majority of the kids were no longer infectious.
“My personal view is that five days is more than sufficient” for isolation, said senior study author Neeraj Sood, a professor of health policy, medicine and business at University of Southern California. Based on the findings, “maybe you could go with something a little shorter for kids.”
An earlier study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine in July 2022, found that adults were infectious for a median of five or six days.
Popescu, who wasn’t involved with either study, said the findings on children will probably be used moving forward for a lot of school-based decisions.
“It’s helpful to see the three days,” Popescu said.
On an individual level, common sense should rule, Hanage said. If you’re sick, stay away from people most at risk for severe complications, such as older relatives.
“You wouldn’t want to give them something that would make them badly ill — whether it’s Covid, flu or even food poisoning,” he said.
Popescu agreed.
“From an infectious disease perspective, we want people to stay home if they have symptoms,” she said. “And just because you don’t have Covid doesn’t mean that you don’t have another infectious disease that could pose a risk to those around you.”
Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist and former assistant professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, urged people to do the best they can and take precautions where possible.
""Nobody's perfect,"" Mina said. ""If you can decrease your chances of spreading to others, that's really good. That alone is very, very good. So if you can't isolate for five days, or it's been five days, but you recognize that you might still be infectious, wear a mask as much as you can, don't attend really densely packed events, and stay away from vulnerable people.""

2024-03-06T14:06:50.460Z,"After decades of failures, researchers have renewed hopes for an effective HIV vaccine",NBC News,"The world needs an HIV vaccine if it ever hopes to beat a virus that still infects over 1 million people a year and contributes to hundreds of thousands of deaths.
Despite 20 years of failures in major HIV vaccine trials — four this decade alone — researchers say recent scientific advances have likely, hopefully, put them on the right track to develop a highly effective vaccine against the insidious virus.
But probably not until the 2030s.
“An effective vaccine is really the only way to provide long-term immunity against HIV, and that’s what we need,” Dr. Julie McElrath, the director of the vaccine and infectious disease division at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle, said Monday at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections in Denver.
All current HIV vaccine action is in the laboratory, animal studies or very early human trials.
Researchers at the retrovirus conference presented favorable results from two HIV vaccine studies. One found that a modification to the simian version of HIV spurred production of what are known as broadly neutralizing antibodies against the virus in monkeys. Another showed promise in the effort to coax the immune system’s B cells to make the powerful antibodies in humans.
“These trials illustrate as a proof of concept that we can train the immune system. But we need to further optimize it and test it in clinical trials,” Karlijn van der Straten, a Ph.D. student at the Academic Medical Center at Amsterdam University, who presented the human study, said at a news conference Monday.
Still, the scrappy scientists in this field face a towering challenge. HIV is perhaps the most complex pathogen ever known.
“The whole field has learned from the past,” said William Schief, who leads Moderna’s HIV vaccine efforts. “We’ve learned strategies that don’t work.”
The cost has already been immense. Nearly $17 billion was spent worldwide on HIV -vaccine research from 2000 to 2021. Nearly $1 billion more is spent annually, according to the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS and the nonprofit HIV group AVAC.
“Maintaining the funding for HIV vaccines right now is really important,” said Dr. Nina Russell, who directs HIV research at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. She pointed to the field’s own “progress and the excitement” and to how “HIV vaccine science and scientists continue to drive innovation and science that benefits other infectious diseases and global health in general.”
Case in point: Covid. Thanks to HIV research, the mRNA vaccine technology was already available in 2020 to speed a coronavirus vaccine to market.
In strong contrast to Covid, the HIV vaccine endeavor has spanned four decades. Only one of the nine HIV vaccine trials have shown efficacy: a trial conducted in Thailand and published in 2009 that reported a modest 31% reduction in HIV risk.
HIV vaccine researchers subsequently spent years seeking to retool and improve that vaccine strategy, leading to a series of trials that launched in the late 2010s — only to fail.
Researchers have concluded those latest trials were doomed because, aside from prompting an anti-HIV response based in immune cells, they only drove the immune system to produce what are known as non-neutralizing antibodies. Those weapons just weren’t strong enough for such a fearsome foe.
Preventing HIV through vaccination remains a daunting challenge because the immune system doesn’t naturally mount an effective defense against the virus, as it does with so many other vaccine-preventable infections, including Covid. An HIV vaccine must coax from the body a supercharged immune response with no natural equivalent.
That path to victory is based on a crucial caveat: A small proportion of people with HIV do produce what are known as broadly neutralizing antibodies against the virus. They attack HIV in multiple ways and can neutralize a swath of variants of the virus.
Those antibodies don’t do much apparent good for people who develop them naturally, because they typically don’t arise until years into infection. HIV establishes a permanent reservoir in the body within about a week after infection, one that their immune response can’t eliminate. So HIV-positive people with such antibodies still require antiretroviral treatment to remain healthy.
Researchers believe that broadly neutralizing antibodies could prevent HIV from ever seeding an infection, provided the defense was ready in advance of exposure. A pair of major efficacy trials, published in 2021, demonstrated that infusions of cloned versions of one such antibody did, indeed, protect people who were exposed to certain HIV strains that are susceptible to that antibody.
However, globally, those particular strains of the virus comprise only a small subset of all circulating HIV. That means researchers can’t simply prompt a vaccine to produce that one antibody and expect it to be effective. Importantly, from this study they got a sense of what antibody level would be required to prevent infection.
It’s a high benchmark, but at least investigators now have a clearer sense of the challenge before them.
Also frustrating the HIV vaccine quest is that the virus mutates like mad. Whatever spot on the surface of the virus that antibodies target might be prone to change through mutation, thus allowing the virus to evade their attack. Consequently, researchers search for targets on the virus’ surface that aren’t highly subject to mutation.
Experts also believe warding off the mutation threat will require targeting multiple sites on the virus. So researchers are seeking to develop a portfolio of immune system prompts that would spur production of an array of broadly neutralizing antibodies.
Prompting the development of such antibodies requires a complex, step-by step process of coaxing the infection-fighting B cells, getting them to multiply and then guiding their maturation into potent broadly neutralizing antibody-producing factories.
Dr. Carl Dieffenbach, the head of the AIDS division at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said numerous recent technological advances — including mRNA, better animal models of HIV infection and high-tech imaging technology — have improved researchers’ precision in designing, and speed in producing, new proteins to spur anti-HIV immune responses.
Global collaboration among major players is also flourishing, researchers said. There are several early-stage human clinical trials of HIV-vaccine components underway.
Three mRNA-based early human trials of such components have been launched since 2022. Among them, they have been led or otherwise funded by the global vaccine research nonprofit group IAVI, Fred Hutch, Moderna, Scripps Research, the Gates Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, the U.S. Agency for International Development, and university teams. More such trials are in the works.
On Friday, Science magazine reported concerning recent findings that among the three mRNA trials, a substantial proportion of participants — 7% to 18%, IAVI said in a statement — experienced skin-related symptoms following injections, including hives, itching and welts.
IAVI said in its statement that it and partners are investigating the HIV trials’ skin-related outcomes, most of which were “mild or moderate and managed with simple allergy medications.”
Researchers have shown success in one of those mRNA trials in executing a particular step in the B-cell cultivation process.
That vaccine component also generated “helper” CD4 cells primed to combat HIV. The immune cells are expected to operate like an orchestra conductor for the immune system, coordinating a response by sending instructions to B cells and scaling up other facets of an assault on HIV.
A complementary strategy under investigation seeks to promote the development of “killer” CD8 cells that might be primed to kill off any immune cells that the antibodies failed to save from infection.
Crucially, investigators believe they are now much better able to discern top vaccine component candidates from the duds. They plan to spend the coming years developing such components so that when they do assemble the most promising among them into a multi-pronged vaccine, they can be much more confident of ultimate success in a trial.
“An HIV vaccine could end HIV,” McElrath said at the Denver conference. “So I say, ‘Let’s just get on with it.”
Dr. Mark Feinberg, president and CEO of IAVI, suggested that the first trial to test effectiveness of the vaccine might not launch until 2030 or later.
Even so, he was bullish.
“The field of HIV vaccine development is in a better place now than it’s ever been,” he said.

2024-03-07T20:51:35.179Z,Two Alabama fertility clinics say they will resume IVF services after bill to protect doctors passes,NBC News,"Two Alabama fertility clinics that paused in vitro fertilization services last month expect to resume them now that state lawmakers have passed a bill to protect doctors and clinics that discard embryos as part of routine IVF services.
The bill ""provides the protections that we need to start care — or resume care, really,"" said Dr. Janet Bouknight, an IVF provider at Alabama Fertility, which suspended IVF services Feb. 22 after the state Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos are considered unborn children.
Bouknight said the clinic does around 10 egg retrievals and 10 frozen embryo transfers per week, so around 40 patients may not have received promised care during the pause in IVF services.
Dr. Warner Huh, chair of the University of Alabama at Birmingham Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, said in a video statement that the bill ""provides some protections and will therefore allow UAB to restart in vitro fertilization treatments, also known as IVF.""
""While UAB is moving to promptly resume IVF treatments, we will continue to assess developments and advocate for protections for IVF patients and our providers,"" he continued.
But the Center for Reproductive Medicine at Mobile Infirmary — the fertility clinic involved in the lawsuit that led to the Alabama Supreme Court decision — said it will not resume IVF services.
""We are not reopening until we have legal clarification on the extent of immunity provided by the new Alabama law,"" the center and its affiliate health care system, Infirmary Health, said in a statement on Thursday.
They added that ""at this time, we believe the law falls short of addressing the fertilized eggs currently stored across the state and leaves challenges for physicians and fertility clinics trying to help deserving families have children of their own.""
After the court ruling on Feb. 16, IVF providers were concerned that they could face legal repercussions for getting rid of embryos — a common part of IVF, because some embryos have genetic abnormalities or are no longer needed. That prompted three Alabama clinics to suspend IVF services.
After that, legislators from both parties called for legal safeguards to protect IVF providers in the state.
The bill that passed Wednesday evening offers civil and criminal “immunity"" to doctors, clinics and other health care personnel who provide IVF. Gov. Kay Ivey signed it into law before midnight Wednesday.
Meghan Cole, a patient at Alabama Fertility, had been planning to start a family via a surrogate because she has a blood disorder that prevents her from safely carrying a pregnancy. But the planned embryo transfer procedure was canceled after the clinic paused its IVF services.
Now that the clinic intends to start offering IVF again, Cole said, she wants to move forward with the transfer.
The last few weeks have been “a roller coaster of emotions,” she said, “from being completely devastated to having hope and now being excited to continue the journey.”
But Cole worries about what might happen in Alabama in the future.
“While this is a win for us right now and a Band-Aid to get us back on track, we’re still planning to move our embryos out of the state,” she said. “I don’t trust what the state’s going to do and don’t want to have to either keep my embryos in storage in perpetuity or not be allowed to discard them.”
The law passed on Wednesday says that “no action, suit, or criminal prosecution for the damage to or death of an embryo shall be brought or maintained against any individual or entity when providing or receiving services related to in vitro fertilization.”
However, it does not specify whether frozen embryos created via IVF have the same rights as children under state law. For that reason, some legal experts and reproductive rights advocates worry it does not go far enough.
""While we are grateful for the actions of Alabama legislators, this legislation does not address the underlying issue of the status of embryos as part of the IVF process — threatening the long-term standard of care for IVF patients,"" Barbara Collura, the CEO of RESOLVE: The National Infertility Association, said in a statement.
The bill’s Republican sponsors characterized the legislation as a quick fix to allow IVF clinics to resume normal operations.
Bouknight said legislators understood ""the pressing need to get this fixed and to have a lasting solution.""
The bill may make companies that store and ship embryos more comfortable to operate in Alabama. At least one major embryo shipping company, Cryoport, paused operations there after the court decision. The company did not respond to an inquiry about whether it will resume services in Alabama.
Brad Senstra, the CEO of ReproTech — a company that offers long-term storage for embryos — said the company had been in talks with Alabama clinics about helping them with embryo storage before the ruling. After the state Supreme Court decision, he said, the company restricted employees from picking up embryo shipments from Alabama clinics in person.
But “Handling of embryos and storing them for patients is definitely providing services related to in vitro fertilization,” Senstra said, so he feels comfortable lifting the restriction.

2024-02-14T16:46:32.727Z,"'I was terrified': Black women may prefer Black OB-GYNs due to fear of discrimination, dying during pregnancy",NBC News,"Fear of discrimination and dying during pregnancy and childbirth may lead pregnant Black women to prefer seeing a Black obstetrician, a small study suggests.
Researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill conducted a series of interviews and focus groups with 32 Black women ages 27 to 34 about their past experiences with obstetric care, along with their perspectives about having a Black obstetrician. The study’s findings were presented Wednesday at the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine’s annual meeting in National Harbor, Maryland.
Women who spoke to the researchers brought up their fear that their pregnancies may kill them.
“I was so scared because I’m like, I might die with this pregnancy. Like that was the first thought in my head. I could very well die just from simply getting pregnant and because I decided to have a child,” one woman said in a focus group during the study.
Black women’s fear of dying during pregnancy and childbirth is a reflection of real-life risks. The maternal mortality rate of Black women in 2021 was 2.6 times higher than the rate of white women, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A 2022 report by the Pew Research Center also found that 71% of Black women ages 18 to 49 reported having at least one negative experience with health care providers in the past.
The discussions also revealed stark instances of racial stereotyping.
One woman said in an interview with the researchers that she was told  “abortion is an option, especially if you don’t know the dad.” She told the provider she did, in fact, know who her child’s father is. “I’m sorry, am I meant to be a single mother?” she told the interviewers.
Another woman said that a nurse kept asking if she needed a social worker or government assistance. “What in my profile is making you ask these questions, are these normal questions? Or are you asking me this because I’m Black?” the woman recalled saying.
The women in the study showed a clear preference for Black obstetricians, but noted how difficult this was to find, the researchers wrote in the study abstract. The findings have not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal.
“So because I was terrified, and this was my fourth C-section, I told my doctors because my doctor is a white woman and I told her I really would like a Black woman in there. Because you know, I’m just afraid,” one woman said in a focus group.
The idea that having a Black obstetrician might make Black patients feel safer during pregnancy care and childbirth has not been rigorously studied, said lead study author Dr. Nicole Teal, a maternal-fetal medicine subspecialist at UC San Diego Health.
Teal, who is white, said that many of the Black patients she’s interacted with have shared being uncomfortable with their prenatal care and have asked her what she’s doing to dismantle the maternal mortality crisis for Black women, which “pushed me in this direction,” she said of her research.
“Racial concordance between providers and patients has shown to improve outcomes in primary care, like with diabetes management, hypertension management and patient trust and satisfaction,” said Teal, who did the study when she was a maternal-fetal medicine fellow at UNC Chapel Hill, adding that she and her co-authors thought there might be a similar pattern for obstetric patients.
Dr. J’Leise Sosa, an OB-GYN based in Buffalo, New York, said the results from the study are “not surprising at all.” Many of the Black women under her care have expressed feelings of relief because of their shared identities, she said.
Sosa, who is Black, also has conversations with her patients about their previous experiences and fears, along with what they’re looking forward to in their pregnancies to see “where I could meet them that’s still medically safe to do,” she said, while still helping them feel comfortable.
“I am often met with this same phrase for my patients who are telling me, ‘I chose you because I trust you, because you’re an African American doctor,’” Sosa said. “‘I am afraid of the statistics I’m hearing about pregnant people and I want to be in a place where I feel safe and heard, and this is why I sought you out.’”
Feelings of relief are also evident in the patients of Dr. Joy Cooper, an OB-GYN and the CEO and co-founder of Culture Care, a telemedicine startup company that connects Black women with Black doctors. While previously working in clinics, Cooper said, she called patients’ reaction “the waiting to exhale,” a pun on the 1995 Black film, from the real-time reactions of patients discovering their OB-GYN is Black.
“Their shoulders relax, they sit back and it’s like ‘I’m going to be heard,’” Cooper said. “They just feel it as a feeling. It’s sometimes hard to describe.”
Not being heard was another major theme revealed in the study.
“I did not feel heard. I didn’t feel like they were taking me seriously,” one woman said.
Another spoke of talking to a white provider about her concerns “but I felt like she wasn’t listening to them, and she was just kind of brushing them off as in not taking me seriously.”
Sosa said there are very “literal and real effects” of not paying attention to pregnant Black patients and not investigating their concerns, including death and severe illness, which can cause long-term hospitalization resulting in physical and emotional trauma. Characteristics of racism are still embedded in the medical curriculum, she added, in methods such as the vaginal birth after cesarean calculator, which helps doctors determine the chances of a woman who previously had a cesarean section having a successful vaginal birth.
“There’s no evidence out there that says a Black person, a Latina person, a Native American person is somehow physiologically genetically at increased risk of C-sections,” she said. Yet, race is still embedded as a factor in the calculator.
Sosa said that hospitals also need to include patients’ experiences of discrimination in quality measures that help address patient satisfaction and community needs.
Both Teal and Cooper agree that recruiting and retaining more Black OB-GYNs is also crucial.
Many institutions cannot retain Black doctors because they’re hostile to Black people, Cooper said,“whether you work for the system, whether you’re getting your care for the system — and that is really the problem of racism in medicine.”
“That’s the part that no one wants to address,” she added.
Teal said she hopes the data from the study will push institutions to prioritize diversifying the workforce, adding that it’s clear many Black patients would prefer to have an obstetrician of the same race.
“So, as a field, we need to work to increase the number of Black OB providers, and that includes physicians, but also midwives,” she said.

2024-02-19T17:13:04.435Z,"High levels of niacin linked to heart disease, new research suggests",NBC News,"High levels of niacin, an essential B vitamin, may raise the risk of heart disease by triggering inflammation and damaging blood vessels, according to new research.
The report, published Monday in Nature Medicine, revealed a previously unknown risk from excessive amounts of the vitamin, which is found in many foods, including meat, fish, nuts, and fortified cereals and breads.
The recommended daily allowance of niacin for men is 16 milligrams per day and for women who are not pregnant is 14 milligrams per day.
About 1 in 4 Americans has higher than the recommended level of niacin, said the study’s senior author, Dr. Stanley Hazen, chair of cardiovascular and metabolic sciences at the Cleveland Clinic’s Lerner Research Institute and co-section head of preventive cardiology at the Heart, Vascular and Thoracic Institute.
The researchers currently don’t know where to draw the line between healthy and unhealthy amounts of niacin, although that may be determined with future research.
""The average person should avoid niacin supplements now that we have reason to believe that taking too much niacin can potentially lead to an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease,” Hazen said.
Currently, Americans get plenty of niacin from their diet since flour, grains and cereals have been fortified with niacin since the 1940s after scientists discovered that very low levels of the nutrient could lead to a potentially fatal condition called pellagra, Hazen said.
Prior to the development of cholesterol-lowering statins, niacin supplements were once even prescribed by doctors to improve cholesterol levels.
To search for unknown risk factors for cardiovascular disease, Hazen and his colleagues designed a multipart study that included an analysis of fasting blood samples from 1,162 patients who had come into a cardiology center to be evaluated for heart disease. The researchers were looking for common markers, or signs, in the patients’ blood that might reveal new risk factors.
The research resulted in the discovery of a substance in some of the blood samples that is only made when there is excess niacin.
That finding led to two additional “validation” studies, which included data from a total of 3,163 adults who either had heart disease or were suspected of having it. The two investigations, one in the U.S. and one in Europe, showed that the niacin breakdown product, 4PY, predicted participants’ future risk of heart attack, stroke and death.
The final part of the study involved experiments in mice. When the rodents were injected with 4PY, inflammation increased in their blood vessels.
The results are “fascinating” and “important,” said Dr. Robert Rosenson, director of metabolism and lipids for the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City.
The newly detected pathway to heart disease might lead to the discovery of a medication that could reduce blood vessel inflammation and decrease the likelihood of major cardiovascular events, he added.
Rosenson hopes that the food industry will take note and “stop using so much niacin in products like bread. This is a case where too much of a good thing can be a bad thing.”
The new information could influence dietary recommendations for niacin, said Rosenson, who was not involved with the Cleveland Clinic research.
Scientists have known for decades that a person’s cholesterol level could be a major driver of heart disease, said Dr. Amanda Doran, an assistant professor of medicine in the division of cardiovascular medicine at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Even when patients’ cholesterol levels were brought down, some continued to have a high risk of heart attacks and stroke, Doran said, adding that a 2017 trial suggested that the increased risk might be related to blood vessel inflammation.
Doran was surprised to learn that niacin could be involved in driving up the risk of heart disease.
“I don’t think anyone would have predicted that niacin would have been pro-inflammatory,” she said. “This is a powerful study because it combines a variety of techniques: clinical data, genetic data and mouse data.”
Finding the new pathway may allow future researchers to discover ways to reduce blood vessel inflammation, Doran said.
“It’s very exciting and promising,” she said.

2024-03-12T23:08:00.000Z,Chicago measles outbreak grows after more cases diagnosed in a migrant shelter,NBC News,"Three more people at a migrant shelter in Chicago have been diagnosed with measles, bringing the city's total to eight cases so far this year.
The Chicago Department of Public Health reported Tuesday that three additional people associated with the shelter had been diagnosed. On Monday it said two adults there were diagnosed. That followed a Sunday announcement that a young child residing at the shelter had been hospitalized with measles but was in “good condition.”
All eight measles patients in the city this year have been diagnosed since the beginning of March, according to the health department's statement Tuesday. All but one of them were described as being connected to the shelter, or Chicago’s “new arrivals mission,” the health department said.
The young child who was hospitalized attends Philip D. Armour Elementary School, a public school. The health department advised school-aged shelter residents not to attend school on Friday or Monday.
“Once a student’s vaccination status has been verified, students with confirmed vaccinations will be notified of the date to return to school,” Pedro Martinez, the CEO of Chicago Public Schools, said in a letter to families on Monday.
The school system said it is working with the health department to respond to the possible measles exposures.
""CPS provides multiple opportunities for vaccination as well as resources for community-based services and we work closely with families to help them be up-to-date on all vaccinations,"" it said in a statement.
The initial measles case detected at the shelter was a young child, not school-aged, who has recovered and is no longer infectious, according to the health department.
Chicago's first measles case this year, announced on Thursday, appears unrelated to the others: health officials said the Chicago resident was not infectious as of Wednesday.
The city's public health department said Tuesday that a team of experts from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had arrived to support efforts to control the spread of the disease.
The cases are the first in Chicago since 2019, though Cook County (which includes Chicago) recorded five cases in an apartment building last year.
Measles has spiked globally in recent months, partly due to a decline in vaccine coverage. The U.S. has recorded at least 45 cases this year, putting it on track to surpass 2023’s total of 58.
Pennsylvania tallied nine cases from December to January, and an outbreak in Florida swelled to 10 cases last month. However, the elementary school at the center of the Florida outbreak has not seen new cases since Feb. 16, according to the state health department.
Three cases have also been reported in California, and one child in Sacramento may have exposed around 300 people to measles at an emergency department on Tuesday.
The Chicago health department said vaccination teams have been screening people for measles at the migrant shelter, located in the city's Pilsen neighborhood, and administering vaccines since Friday. Over the weekend, nearly all the shelter residents were assessed and more than 900 got vaccinated, the department said.
Shelter residents who are still unvaccinated, were recently vaccinated or are unsure of their vaccination status were instructed to quarantine for 21 days.
“We have advised all unvaccinated and newly vaccinated residents of the quarantine period but some of those residents have left the shelter, and I want to acknowledge that,” Dr. Simbo Ige, Chicago public health commissioner, said in a statement on Sunday.
The health department said Monday that some shelter residents are being relocated to alternative sites or hotel spaces depending on their immunity status and quarantine requirements.
Measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccines will also be available to migrants in other shelters, officials said, and to migrants arriving in Chicago as part of their intake process.
If an unvaccinated person is exposed to measles and hasn’t developed symptoms yet, an MMR vaccine can ward off infection if administered within 72 hours. A preventive injection called immune globulin can be given within six days of exposure.
Measles is highly contagious: An infected person can spread the virus to up to 90% of the people close to them if those contacts aren’t immune, and people can remain contagious for roughly eight days.
In his letter, Martinez advised Chicago parents to make sure their kids' vaccine records are up-to-date at their schools. The Illinois Department of Public Health's Vax Verify tool allows parents to check vaccination records for those immunized in the state from 2007 onward.
Data from the Illinois State Board of Education indicates that hundreds of Chicago schools had less than 95% coverage for the MMR vaccine in the 2022-2023 school year.
Vaccination rates in schools have declined nationwide. The share of U.S. kindergartners who had received two doses of the MMR vaccine was 93% in the 2022–23 school year, down from 94% in the 2020–21 year, and 95% for nearly 10 years before that.
Children in the U.S. are expected to get their first measles vaccine between 12 and 15 months, and their second between 4 and 6 years old. One dose is 93% effective and two doses are 97% effective, according to the CDC.
Measles symptoms include a high fever, cough, conjunctivitis (pink eye) and runny nose. Two to three days after symptoms start, people usually notice tiny white spots in their mouth. Between days three and five, blotchy rash often develops from head to toe.
Symptoms typically last 10 days unless severe complications arise — these can include swelling of the brain, pneumonia or secondary bacterial infections.
Roughly 1 to 3 out of every 1,000 children infected with measles die from respiratory and neurological complications. In rare cases, measles can lead to blindness or long-term vision problems.

2024-02-25T18:45:41.000Z,"Newly approved drug protects against multiple food allergies, giving an 'extra layer of comfort'",NBC News,"Kevin Wang and Annie Marqueling’s son Liam was 8 months old when he broke out in hives all over his body after eating a few bits of a scrambled egg. An allergy test revealed Liam was allergic to eggs, as well as peanuts and tree nuts, and for the next year, the entire family avoided foods that could trigger a dangerous reaction.
“We had to pay special attention to every single item that we brought to the house because it could potentially be a life-threatening allergen for him,” Wang said. “There’s multiple times where we’ve had to reach out and take a cookie before he takes a bite because we were unsure of the contents.”
Then, two years ago, Wang and Marqueling, who live in Palo Alto, California, found out about a clinical trial for a decades-old drug called omalizumab. The injectable drug was approved in 2003 under the name Xolair for allergic asthma and later expanded to include chronic hives, but now there was evidence it could also protect against severe allergic reactions to food.
They enrolled Liam in the trial.
The results were published Sunday in the New England Journal of Medicine. In order to participate in the clinical trial, patients had to be allergic to peanuts along with two other foods. After four months, many of the participants were able to tolerate small amounts of the foods they were allergic to, meaning an accidental exposure was no longer a life-threatening event.
Senior study author Dr. Sharon Chinthrajah, an associate professor of medicine and pediatrics at and acting director of the Sean Parker Center for Allergy and Asthma Research at Stanford University, noted that Xolair is not a cure, and patients still need to avoid the foods they are allergic to. “But it is a tremendous layer of safety,” she said.
“This therapy offers injections and offers an umbrella, a safety protection, to go out and live your lives normally to not be as afraid of accidental exposures and everyday living,” Chinthrajah said.
Earlier this month, the Food and Drug Administration expanded the approval for Xolair for certain kids and adults with food allergies, based on the results of the clinical trial.
“The very same day the FDA approved the drug, we were writing prescriptions for our food allergy patients,” Chinthrajah said.
Just over 6% of people in the U.S., including 6% of kids, have a food allergy, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About 40% of kids who have food allergies have a reaction to more than one food, according to a study in the Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.
Until now, only one medication, called Palforzia, has been available to protect against acute allergic reactions to food, and the drug only works for peanuts. In addition to peanuts, Xolair works for other common food allergies, including eggs, milk and wheat.
In the clinical trial, funded largely by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, Chinthrajah and her team recruited 180 people across 10 hospitals in the U.S. who were allergic to peanuts and at least two of the following foods: cashews, milk, eggs, walnuts, wheat or hazelnuts. The participants ranged in age from 1 to 55 years — about 40% were younger than 6 and most were younger than 18 — and 118 of them received a monthly or biweekly dose of Xolair. The rest got a placebo. The first 60 people to finish the initial stage of the trial — 59 of whom were younger than 18 — were extended for another 24 weeks.
By the end of the initial four-month period, about 80% of people who got the drug were able to eat small amounts of one of the foods they were allergic to without triggering their normal reaction. About two-thirds were able to tolerate two to three peanuts, “which is much larger than an average accidental exposure,” Chinthrajah said.
Nearly 70% could eat small amounts of two of their three allergic foods without a reaction. Nearly half could tolerate small amounts of all three.
“One of the biggest things for kids and even adults living with food allergies is fear of accidental exposure,” said Dr. Ruchi Gupta, the founding director of the Center for Food Allergy & Asthma Research at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. “This gives peace of mind at least for those small amounts that they may come into contact with.”
When a person with a food allergy eats that food — or sometimes even comes into contact with it — their immune system releases a flood of antibodies called IgE. These antibodies attach themselves to certain cells, triggering a systemwide reaction. Xolair is an antibody drug that acts as a sponge, binding to IgE antibodies and preventing them from latching onto these cells.
“The drug’s ability to do this is finite,” however, Gupta said. For that reason, the drug is meant to prevent reactions to small accidental exposures to allergic foods rather than allowing a person to indulge in them.
Marqueling and Wang don’t know whether Liam, now 5, got the actual drug or the placebo during the clinical trial.
Now, however, he can tolerate small amounts of peanuts and tree nuts, so they believe it was the real thing.
The trial has changed their experience as parents.
“We have this extra layer of comfort knowing that he is protected in these accidental exposures that mom and dad can’t always be around for,” Wang said.
Xolair isn’t meant for everyone with food allergies. It only works for people whose food allergies are Type I, meaning the person always produces IgE antibodies when they are exposed to the food they are allergic to, and it isn’t always effective — 20% of the people in the study were not able to tolerate even small amounts of their trigger foods even when taking the medication.
All experts stressed that people taking the drug should still be cautious.
“I think it will help mitigate fear and anxiety, but definitely still avoid the allergen and carry an EpiPen,” said Dr. Asal Gharib Naderi, an allergist and immunologist at Keck Medicine at the University of Southern California who wasn’t involved with the trial.
In rare instances, people can go into anaphylactic shock after taking Xolair, but Gharib Naderi said this typically happens when people are starting on the drug, usually within the first three doses. These early doses are given in a doctor’s office, where the patient can be monitored for a reaction. Later doses can be taken at home.
In the U.S., Xolair is made by drugmakers Genentech and Novartis. A spokesperson for Genentech said the estimated monthly list price for the drug is around $2,900 for children and $5,000 for adults. The actual out-of-pocket cost to patients is typically lower, the spokesperson said, based on insurance and other financial assistance programs.
While Xolair could previously be prescribed off-label for food allergies, insurance companies rarely cover off-label uses. With the FDA’s expanded approval, doctors hope insurance companies will be more likely to cover it for food allergies.
“I don’t want a drug like this to increase the disparities we already see in food allergies,” Gupta said. “There are quite a few more treatments on the heels of Xolair, and we need to make sure those are accessible.”
It’s currently unclear how long someone would need to be on Xolair for food allergies, but that is the subject of additional research.
“This could potentially be a lifelong therapy,” Chinthrajah said.
CORRECTION (Feb. 26, 2024, 3:54 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated what the drug Xolair was initially approved for in 2003. It was approved only for asthma, not asthma and chronic hives.

2024-01-15T10:30:40.000Z,Medical mistakes are more likely in women and minorities,NBC News,"Charity Watkins sensed something was deeply wrong when she experienced exhaustion after her daughter was born.
At times, Watkins, then 30, had to stop on the stairway to catch her breath. Her obstetrician said postpartum depression likely caused the weakness and fatigue. When Watkins, who is Black, complained of a cough, her doctor blamed the flu.
About eight weeks after delivery, Watkins thought she was having a heart attack, and her husband took her to the emergency room. After a 5½-hour wait in a North Carolina hospital, she returned home to nurse her baby without seeing a doctor.
When a physician finally examined Watkins three days later, he immediately noticed her legs and stomach were swollen, a sign that her body was retaining fluid. After a chest X-ray, the doctor diagnosed her with heart failure, a serious condition in which the heart becomes too weak to adequately pump oxygen-rich blood to organs throughout the body. Watkins spent two weeks in intensive care.
She said a cardiologist later told her, “We almost lost you.”
Watkins is among 12 million adults misdiagnosed every year in the U.S.
In a study published Jan. 8 in JAMA Internal Medicine, researchers found that nearly 1 in 4 hospital patients who died or were transferred to intensive care had experienced a diagnostic error. Nearly 18% of misdiagnosed patients were harmed or died.
In all, an estimated 795,000 patients a year die or are permanently disabled because of misdiagnosis, according to a study published in July in the BMJ Quality & Safety periodical.
Some patients are at higher risk than others.
Women and racial and ethnic minorities are 20% to 30% more likely than white men to experience a misdiagnosis, said Dr. David Newman-Toker, a professor of neurology at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and the lead author of the BMJ study. “That’s significant and inexcusable,” he said.
Researchers call misdiagnosis an urgent public health problem. The study found that rates of misdiagnosis range from 1.5% of heart attacks to 17.5% of strokes and 22.5% of lung cancers.
Weakening of the heart muscle — which led to Watkins’ heart failure — is the most common cause of maternal death one week to one year after delivery, and is more common among Black women.
Heart failure “should have been No. 1 on the list of possible causes” for Watkins’ symptoms, said Dr. Ronald Wyatt, chief science and chief medical officer at the Society to Improve Diagnosis in Medicine, a nonprofit research and advocacy group.
Maternal mortality for Black mothers has increased dramatically in recent years. The United States has the highest maternal mortality rate among developed countries. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, non-Hispanic Black mothers are 2.6 times as likely to die as non-Hispanic white moms. More than half of these deaths take place within a year after delivery.
Research shows that Black women with childbirth-related heart failure are typically diagnosed later than white women, said Dr. Jennifer Lewey, co-director of the pregnancy and heart disease program at Penn Medicine. That can allow patients to further deteriorate, making Black women less likely to fully recover and more likely to suffer from weakened hearts for the rest of their lives.
Watkins said the diagnosis changed her life. Doctors advised her “not to have another baby, or I might need a heart transplant,” she said. Being deprived of the chance to have another child, she said, “was devastating.”
Racial and gender disparities are widespread.
Women and minority patients suffering from heart attacks are more likely than others to be discharged without diagnosis or treatment.
Black people with depression are more likely than others to be misdiagnosed with schizophrenia.
Minorities are less likely than whites to be diagnosed early with dementia, depriving them of the opportunities to receive treatments that work best in the early stages of the disease.
Misdiagnosis isn’t new. Doctors have used autopsy studies to estimate the percentage of patients who died with undiagnosed diseases for more than a century. Although those studies show some improvement over time, life-threatening mistakes remain all too common, despite an array of sophisticated diagnostic tools, said Dr. Hardeep Singh, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine who studies ways to improve diagnosis.
“The vast majority of diagnoses can be made by getting to know the patient’s story really well, asking follow-up questions, examining the patient, and ordering basic tests,” said Singh, who is also a researcher at Houston’s Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center. When talking to people who’ve been misdiagnosed, “one of the things we hear over and over is, ‘The doctor didn’t listen to me.’”
Racial disparities in misdiagnosis are sometimes explained by noting that minority patients are less likely to be insured than white patients and often lack access to high-quality hospitals. But the picture is more complicated, said Dr. Monika Goyal, an emergency physician at Children’s National Hospital in Washington, D.C., who has documented racial bias in children’s health care.
In a 2020 study, Goyal and her colleagues found that Black kids with appendicitis were less likely than their white peers to be correctly diagnosed, even when both groups of patients visited the same hospital.
Although few doctors deliberately discriminate against women or minorities, Goyal said, many are biased without realizing it.
“Racial bias is baked into our culture,” Goyal said. “It’s important for all of us to start recognizing that.”
Demanding schedules, which prevent doctors from spending as much time with patients as they’d like, can contribute to diagnostic errors, said Karen Lutfey Spencer, a professor of health and behavioral sciences at the University of Colorado-Denver. “Doctors are more likely to make biased decisions when they are busy and overworked,” Spencer said. “There are some really smart, well-intentioned providers who are getting chewed up in a system that’s very unforgiving.”
Doctors make better treatment decisions when they’re more confident of a diagnosis, Spencer said.
In an experiment, researchers asked doctors to view videos of actors pretending to be patients with heart disease or depression, make a diagnosis, and recommend follow-up actions. Doctors felt far more certain diagnosing white men than Black patients or younger women.
“If they were less certain, they were less likely to take action, such as ordering tests,” Spencer said. “If they were less certain, they might just wait to prescribe treatment.”
It’s easy to see why doctors are more confident when diagnosing white men, Spencer said. For more than a century, medical textbooks have illustrated diseases with stereotypical images of white men. Only 4.5% of images in general medical textbooks feature patients with dark skin.
That may help explain why patients with darker complexions are less likely to receive a timely diagnosis with conditions that affect the skin, from cancer to Lyme disease, which causes a red or pink rash in the earliest stage of infection. Black patients with Lyme disease are more likely to be diagnosed with more advanced disease, which can cause arthritis and damage the heart. Black people with melanoma are about three times as likely as whites to die within five years.
The Covid pandemic helped raise awareness that pulse oximeters — the fingertip devices used to measure a patient’s pulse and oxygen levels — are less accurate for people with dark skin. The devices work by shining light through the skin; their failures have delayed critical care for many Black patients.
Seven years after her misdiagnosis, Watkins is an assistant professor of social work at North Carolina Central University in Durham, where she studies the psychosocial effects experienced by Black mothers who survive severe childbirth complications.
“Sharing my story is part of my healing,” said Watkins, who speaks to medical groups to help doctors improve their care. “It has helped me reclaim power in my life, just to be able to help others.”

2024-01-11T20:06:25.815Z,Philadelphia measles outbreak has hospitals on alert after child was sent to day care despite quarantine instructions,NBC News,"At least eight people have been diagnosed with measles in an outbreak that started last month in the Philadelphia area. The most recent two cases were confirmed on Monday.
The outbreak began after a child who'd recently spent time in another country was admitted to the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) with an infection, which was subsequently identified as measles. The Philadelphia Department of Public Health considers the case to be ""imported"" but did not say from where.
The disease then spread to three other people at CHOP, two of whom were already hospitalized there for other reasons.
Two of those infected at the hospital were a parent and child. The child had not been vaccinated and the parent was offered medication usually given to unvaccinated people that can prevent infection after exposure to measles, but refused it, the Philadelphia Inquirer first reported.
Despite quarantine instructions, the child was sent to day care on Dec. 20 and 21, the health department said.
At that day care facility, called Multicultural Education Station, four more people got infected. A day care staff member said its administrator was unavailable for comment.
Health officials in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, warned on Thursday that a person with measles visited two healthcare facilities there on Jan. 3, which in turn exposed others. No cases have been confirmed in the county, however.
None of the people in Philadelphia who've been diagnosed was immune to measles, the city's health department said, which means they either never got a measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine or had not contracted measles in the past. The health department declined to offer specifics about the patients' ages or vaccination status, however.
The outbreak has led four people to be admitted to the hospital in addition to the two who were already hospitalized, the department said.
Philadelphia hospitals are on high alert for new cases, since measles is very contagious. An infected person can infect up to 90% of the people close to them if those contacts aren’t immune. People can remain contagious for roughly eight days (four days before the disease's signature rash appears and four days after).
The virus can also survive up to two hours in the air after an infected person leaves an area.
“With those who’ve had a rash, certainly we’ve been on the highest alert, but we are asking everybody about exposures to people with measles,” said Dr. Doug Thompson, chief medical officer at St. Christopher’s Hospital for Children in Philadelphia.
Thompson said the hospital has seen three measles patients in the current outbreak — all between 1 and 2 years old. None had been vaccinated, he added.
Measles usually causes a high fever, cough, runny nose and red, watery eyes. Then a red, blotchy rash may form three to five days later.
Roughly 1 in 5 unvaccinated people who gets measles is hospitalized, and 1 to 3 out of every 1,000 children with measles dies from severe complications such as pneumonia or swelling of the brain.
People who've been vaccinated and get exposed shouldn’t worry about getting sick, Thompson said. One dose is 93% effective at preventing measles, and two doses are 97% effective, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The protection is lifelong.
At least 93% of children in Philadelphia have been fully vaccinated against measles by age 6. Children get their first dose between 12 and 15 months and their second between 4 and 6 years old.
For people who get exposed and aren't immune, a vaccine can still ward off infection if administered within 72 hours. Another option is a preventative injection called immune globulin, which delivers antibodies. It must be given within six days of exposure.
Thompson estimated that more than 15 people who may have been exposed to measles at St. Christopher’s have received immune globulin.
""If somebody was at the hospital sitting in the same room with that patient — in the waiting room, let's say — and they were deemed at risk, we brought them into our emergency department and we gave them the immune globulin,"" he said.
A smaller number of people exposed at the hospital received a measles vaccine, Thompson said.
The U.S. effectively eliminated measles in 2000, though there are occasional outbreaks that originate in other countries.
From October to December 2022, the CDC confirmed 85 cases of locally acquired measles in Ohio. Earlier that year, four Ohio residents had brought measles to the U.S. after traveling to East Africa, but the CDC could not definitively link the outbreak to those cases.
New York experienced a large outbreak in 2018 and 2019 that began when unvaccinated travelers returned to the U.S. from Israel. The CDC confirmed 242 cases in the state, excluding New York City, from October 2018 to April 2019, as well as 33 cases in New Jersey.
Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said the recent outbreaks are likely a result of declining vaccination rates.
""Measles is the most contagious of the vaccine-preventable diseases, so when you lower immunization rates, that’s the first disease to come back,” he said.
For nearly 10 years, the share of U.S. kindergartners who had received two doses of the MMR vaccine was 95%. But that rate fell to  93% in the 2022–23 school year. The number of people claiming vaccine exemptions for their kids has risen in the last year.
Offit pointed to misinformation about vaccine safety, opposition to vaccination requirements and parents' fears about taking their kids to the doctor during the Covid pandemic as factors that have driven the trend.
People also seem to have forgotten how contagious measles can be, he said.
""People falsely think that you're only going to get measles if you come in direct contact with somebody who has measles. That's not true,"" Offit said. ""It's these very fine, aerosolized droplets which contain measles that hang in the air like a ghost. And until they settle, you're at risk.""

2024-02-09T17:54:10.545Z,Novo Nordisk settles two lawsuits over copycat versions of Ozempic and Wegovy,NBC News,"Novo Nordisk said Friday it settled two lawsuits against two businesses claiming to offer compounded versions of its blockbuster drugs Ozempic and Wegovy.
The drugmaker has filed a total of 12 lawsuits against clinics, med spas and compounding pharmacies in the U.S. that claim to offer semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy.
Novo Nordisk holds the patent on semaglutide, and the drugmaker does not supply the ingredient to outside groups, leaving some experts wondering what exactly is being sold to consumers.
The two businesses in the settlements — Cosmetic Laser Professionals Med Spa and Nuvida Rx Weight Loss, both based in Florida — are permanently banned from claiming that their compounded drugs are medicines approved by the Food and Drug Administration, according to Novo Nordisk.
They are also permanently banned from using any Novo Nordisk trademarks or logos in their products as well as any ""misleading"" advertising, the drugmaker said. Both businesses are required to make the changes immediately.
The settlements come as states have been cracking down on compounded versions of the drug, which they say may contain other ingredients that are not approved by the FDA.
Late last year, Novo Nordisk said that it had conducted tests on  compounded products allegedly being sold as semaglutide from two Florida pharmacies. One sample, the drugmaker claimed in a lawsuit filed in November, had a level of unknown impurities of 33%. Another sample had lower levels of the active ingredient than described on the label, along with impurities, according to a separate lawsuit.
The FDA and the World Health Organization have also sounded the alarm about counterfeit versions of the drug.
CORRECTION (Feb. 13, 2024, 1:43 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated how long the two businesses were given to make the changes required in the settlements. They must be implemented immediately, not within a year.

But the agency also said officials cannot definitively rule out that “a small risk may exist” and that they’ll continue to look into reports regarding more than a dozen drugs, including Ozempic, Wegovy and Mounjaro. Patients taking the drugs should report any concerns to health care providers, the FDA said.
The review follows a recent federally funded study that showed that people taking semaglutide, the medication in Ozempic and Wegovy, had a lower risk of suicidal thoughts than those taking other drugs to treat obesity and diabetes. The review came after European regulators said they were investigating anecdotal reports that people taking semaglutide had thoughts of self-harm.
“Our preliminary evaluation has not found evidence that use of these medicines causes suicidal thoughts or actions,” the FDA report said.
The agency is analyzing reports related to more than a dozen drugs approved since 2005 that are known as GLP-1 receptor agonists. The medications help control blood sugar levels and reduce the risk of heart disease in people with type 2 diabetes. Some of the drugs are also used to help people with obesity or who are overweight shed pounds.

2024-01-22T16:27:37.534Z,World's first malaria vaccine program for children starts in Cameroon,NBC News,"Cameroon will be the first country to routinely give children a new malaria vaccine as the shots are rolled out in Africa.
The campaign due to start Monday was described by officials as a milestone in the decades-long effort to curb the mosquito-spread disease on the continent, which accounts for 95% of the world’s malaria deaths.
“The vaccination will save lives. It will provide major relief to families and the country’s health system,” said Aurelia Nguyen, chief program officer at the Gavi vaccines alliance, which is helping Cameroon secure the shots.
The Central Africa nation hopes to vaccinate about 250,000 children this year and next year. Gavi said it is working with 20 other African countries to help them get the vaccine and that those countries will hopefully immunize more than 6 million children through 2025.
In Africa, there are about 250 million cases of the parasitic disease each year, including 600,000 deaths, mostly in young children.
Cameroon will use the first of two recently approved malaria vaccines, known as Mosquirix. The World Health Organization endorsed the vaccine two years ago, acknowledging that that even though it is imperfect, its use would still dramatically reduce severe infections and hospitalizations.
The GlaxoSmithKline-produced shot is only about 30% effective, requires four doses and protection begins to fade after several months. The vaccine was tested in Africa and used in pilot programs in three countries.
GSK has said it can only produce about 15 million doses of Mosquirix a year and some experts believe a second malaria vaccine developed by Oxford University and approved by WHO in October might be a more practical solution. That vaccine is cheaper, requiring three doses, and India’s Serum Institute said they could make up to 200 million doses a year.
Gavi’s Nguyen said they hoped there might be enough of the Oxford vaccines available to begin immunizing people later this year.
Neither of the malaria vaccines stop transmission, so other tools like bed nets and insecticidal spraying will still be critical. The malaria parasite mostly spreads to people via infected mosquitoes and can cause symptoms including fever, headaches and chills.

2024-02-02T19:37:04.645Z,Washington state faces first outbreak of a deadly fungal infection that's on the rise in the U.S.,NBC News,"Four people in Washington state have tested positive this month for a rare fungal infection that can be deadly.
It's the state's first known outbreak of the fungus, called Candida auris, according to Seattle and King County health officials, though one locally acquired case was detected there in July. No deaths have been reported.
The cluster comes as Candida auris continues to spread in the U.S.: Case numbers have risen every year since 2016.
The pathogen is resistant to some common antifungal medications, and it tends to infect people with weakened immune systems. It's often detected among hospital patients who use catheters, breathing tubes or feeding tubes.
Three of the people who tested positive in Washington were patients at Kindred Hospital Seattle First Hill, a long-term acute care hospital. Their cases were detected through a routine screening program that aims to identify infections before symptoms develop.
A fourth patient had previously received care at Kindred but tested positive at a health care facility in Snohomish County, the public health department for Seattle and King County told NBC News.
The department announced Tuesday that it was notified of the first case on Jan. 10, followed by two more on Jan. 22 and a fourth on Jan. 26. All but one of the patients tested negative for Candida auris when they were admitted to Kindred, suggesting they contracted the fungus sometime afterward.
The health department said one patient developed an infection, which means the fungus entered a part of the body where it would most likely cause symptoms (such as the bloodstream, the ears or an open wound).
The others were colonized with Candida auris — a term used for situations in which people carry the fungus on their bodies and could spread it to others but don’t necessarily get sick from it. People colonized with Candida auris are still at risk of developing infections.
Kindred Hospital Seattle First Hill said in a statement that all three affected patients there are asymptomatic so far and ""were appropriately isolated from the rest of the patient population with extra clinical and cleaning precautions to prevent spread.""
Candida auris was first identified in Japan in 2009. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention requested in 2016 that U.S. laboratories report it, and a review of records subsequently identified cases dating to 2013.
Since reporting began, the sharpest increase came from 2020 to 2021, when the number of Candida auris cases rose 94%.
As of December 2022, the fungus had been detected in 36 states. In total, the CDC recorded more than 5,600 Candida auris infections from 2013 to 2022, while more than 13,000 others identified through screenings didn’t have signs of infection.
The CDC attributes Candida auris' rise to increased screening and poor infection control and prevention practices in health care facilities — a challenge most likely made worse by staffing shortages and lengthy patient stays during the Covid pandemic.
""It will reach into every corner of the country for sure,"" said Dr. Peter Pappas, a professor of medicine at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. ""The question is going to be how well can we control it?""
Around 90% of Candida auris strains in the U.S. are resistant to the medication most commonly used to treat other fungal infections. Most strains of Candida auris can be treated with drugs from one of the three main classes of antifungal medicines, but some are resistant to all three.
According to the Seattle and King County health department, Washington's first case was in a Pierce County resident who had been admitted to a hospital there, then transferred to Kindred Hospital Seattle First Hill.
Kindred is the only facility in Washington that screens all new admitted patients for Candida auris — part of a state-led program launched in 2022. The tests involve swabbing the armpits and the groin, which are oily parts of skin that the fungus likes to colonize.
""This is the first time we’ve been able to identify multiple cases in one setting thanks to the screening program. But it’s difficult to say to what extent C. auris is circulating,"" said Sharon Bogan, a spokesperson for the Seattle and King County health department.
Pappas said the four cases could be a sign that C. auris is spreading more widely in the Seattle area.
""By the time it shows up in a hospital, you know it’s been in the community for quite some time,"" he said. ""It’s just unclear how long that would be.""
Pappas added that most of the time, it's easy to distinguish an infection from colonization, though ""there are gray areas.""
""Those with invasive infections have infections that just have to be treated. Otherwise, the consequences could be pretty, pretty dramatic,"" he said.
The mortality rate of a severe Candida auris infection in the U.S. is 30% to 60%, but healthy people usually don’t get infected.
Dr. Arturo Casadevall, the chair of molecular microbiology and immunology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said people should actually be reassured when they hear of new cases picked up by active surveillance in their states.
""In a way, it’s disheartening to know that it’s there. But can you imagine if you didn’t have surveillance?"" he said.
He added that ""most people shouldn’t have to worry about getting it just because it’s in the community.""
People can get Candida auris through direct contact with a person carrying the fungus or by touching surfaces or objects that have been contaminated with it. Studies have shown that the fungus can live on surfaces for at least two weeks.
""Once this stuff gets into a hospital, it’s kind of hard to get it out,"" Casadevall said.
CLARIFICATION (Feb. 2, 2024, 2:35 p.m. ET): This article has been updated to indicate that one of the patients left Kindred Hospital before testing positive for Candida auris. A statement from the hospital has been added, as well.

2024-02-09T02:08:28.602Z,"Robotic device burned a woman’s small intestine during surgery, lawsuit alleges",NBC News,"A robotic device burned and tore a woman’s small intestine while she was undergoing surgery for colon cancer, according to a wrongful death lawsuit filed this week in Florida.
The woman, Sandra Sultzer, developed abdominal pain and fever after her surgery in September 2021 and needed additional procedures to close the tear, the lawsuit said. The suit said she died in February 2022 because of the small intestine injury.
Her husband, Harvey Sultzer, is suing the maker of the device, Intuitive Surgical, for damages.
The suit alleges that Intuitive Surgical knew the robot had insulation problems that might cause electricity to leak out and burn internal organs but didn’t disclose that risk to the Sultzers or the public.
It also claims that Intuitive sells its robots to hospitals that have no experience in robotic surgery and doesn’t properly train surgeons in how to use the device, known as the da Vinci. Intuitive does offer a training program, but an NBC News investigation in 2018 found that it can’t legally require surgeons to complete it.
Intuitive Surgical didn’t respond to a request for comment. Jack Scarola, a Florida attorney representing Harvey Sultzer, said neither he nor his client had any comment beyond the allegations in the suit.
Issues of such a nature go back more than a decade, according to the lawsuit.
The suit alleges that Intuitive has received thousands of reports about injuries and defects associated with the da Vinci but has “systematically underreported” injuries to the Food and Drug Administration.
A 2014 financial report that Intuitive filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission said the company at the time was a defendant in around 93 lawsuits.
The plaintiffs in about 93 suits ""allege that they or a family member underwent surgical procedures that utilized the da Vinci Surgical System and sustained a variety of personal injuries and, in some cases, death as a result of such surgery,"" the company wrote.
The company added that it also set aside $67.4 million in the first quarter of 2014 and $9.6 million in the second quarter so it could settle a number of product liability claims.
A case that went to trial in 2017 involved the use of the da Vinci robot during a woman’s hysterectomy. Intuitive said the claim was without merit, and it was settled for an undisclosed amount. A jury previously ruled in favor of Intuitive in a case in 2013 that alleged the company failed to provide sufficient training to doctors.
In its 2023 annual report, the company told the SEC that it was a defendant in ""a number of individual product liability lawsuits"" involving the same allegations.
Many doctors consider robotic surgery to be safe, but there’s debate about whether it’s more effective than traditional surgery. The technology is meant to make procedures more precise and less invasive, which in theory would lead to shorter and less painful recoveries.
Intuitive introduced the first version of the da Vinci system in 1999, when robotic surgery was still relatively novel. The FDA approved the system a year later.
According to Sultzer’s lawsuit, Intuitive received hundreds of complaints and reports about its da Vinci robot from July 2009 to December 2011. Many of the reports mentioned cracks or slits on a rubber tip used to cover da Vinci’s metal instruments, the suit said, adding that the defects allowed electricity to escape without surgeons’ knowledge.
In 2011, researchers from the University of Western Ontario flagged safety concerns with the device’s surgical instruments in a study. The researchers tested 37 instruments and found that all of them had “energy leakage,” which in some cases they determined was sufficient to cause electrical burns.
Then, in July 2013, the FDA sent a warning letter to Intuitive, citing several examples of its failure to comply with federal regulations. One of the examples involved the company’s sending letters to clients about how to use its tip covers — a response to complaints and reports of patient injuries.
“Though the field action was undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device, you failed to report the field action to the FDA as required,” the FDA letter said.
By the time the letter was sent, Intuitive had already recalled the tip covers. A subsequent letter from the FDA in 2014 said Intuitive had addressed the violations cited in the warning.
But other adverse events associated with the da Vinci robot have been reported since then.
An NBC News analysis in 2018 identified more than 20,000 adverse events related to the da Vinci in the last 10 years, based on reports filed to the FDA’s MAUDE database, which tracks issues with medical devices. Most of the reports were related to malfunctions, some of which were minor. But 2,000 reports cited injuries, and 274 involved deaths.
In total, more than a dozen patients told NBC News in 2018 that they were burned or injured during procedures that involved the da Vinci. One woman’s medical records showed that her colon was damaged and her uterus was burned during a 2015 hysterectomy involving the robot.
Intuitive responded to the allegations at the time, saying the device’s safety was backed by scientific evidence.
“While any surgery regardless of modality carries risk, the best evidence of the safety and efficacy of robotic-assisted surgery can be found in the more than 15,000 peer-reviewed scientific publications that are fully grounded in scientific method and that, in aggregate, support the safety and efficacy of our systems,” it said.

2024-03-07T18:44:25.073Z,Weight-loss drugs like Wegovy are meant for long-term use. What happens if you stop?,NBC News,"Millions of Americans who have dropped pounds and boosted their health using popular obesity drugs like Wegovy are facing a new dilemma: What happens if they stop taking them?
Many worry, rightly, that they’ll regain weight and revert to old habits. In clinical trials, patients who paused the drugs put back on most of the weight they lost.
But others are gambling on a do-it-yourself strategy to ease off the drugs and stay slim by stretching out doses, taking the medication intermittently or stopping and starting again only if needed.
“To me, it’s a help, it’s an aid,” said Donna Cooper, 62, of Front Royal, Virginia, who lost nearly 40 pounds in nine months using Wegovy along with diet and exercise. “At some point you have to come off of them. I don’t want to be on them forever.”
More than 3 million prescriptions for the new medications are dispensed each month in the U.S., according to recent data from the health technology company IQVIA. They include semaglutide, the drug in Ozempic and Wegovy, and tirzepatide, the drug in Mounjaro and Zepbound.
But many people don’t stick with it. One recent study published in the journal Obesity found that just 40% of patients who filled a prescription for Wegovy in 2021 or 2022 were still taking it a year later.
Doctors who treat obesity stress that the disease is a chronic condition that must be managed indefinitely, like heart disease or high blood pressure. The new injection drugs work by mimicking hormones in the gut and the brain to regulate appetite and feelings of fullness. They were designed — and tested — to be taken continuously, experts said.
“We are not an injection shop,” said Dr. Andres Acosta, an obesity researcher and medical adviser at the Mayo Clinic. “I don’t think they should be used in intermittent fashion. It’s not approved for that. They don’t work like that.”
Despite that directive, some patients who achieved their health and weight goals with the drugs are looking for an off-ramp, said Dr. Amy Rothberg, a University of Michigan endocrinologist who directs a weight-management and diabetes treatment program.
“Many of them want to step down or de-escalate their dose,” she said. “And they’re also wanting to ultimately discontinue the medication.”
The reasons for pausing the drugs can vary, said Dr. Katherine Saunders, an obesity expert at Weill Cornell Medicine and co-founder of the obesity treatment company Intellihealth. Some patients don’t like side effects such as nausea and constipation. Others want to stop for holidays or special occasions — or just because they don’t want to take the weekly shots indefinitely.
One of Saunders’ patients, a 53-year-old New York man, lost 70 pounds last year using Mounjaro. He told Saunders he wanted to take “a breather” from the medication to see how his body reacted. On her advice, he has been stretching out injections to every 10 days or two weeks, instead of weekly, since December.
Other patients have been forced to ration or halt doses because the drugs are costly — $1,000 to $1,300 per month — and insurance coverage varies or because demand has far outstripped supply, Rothberg noted.
“It’s being imposed on them,” she said. “By necessity they have to go off the medication and kind of figure it out.”
But hoping the drugs’ benefits will last even after stopping them ignores the fundamental biology of obesity, experts said. The disease affects the way the body processes and stores energy, causing it to accumulate weight. The new drugs alter that process and when patients stop, the disease returns, often with a vengeance.
Many people dropping off the medications report a sharp rise in symptoms of obesity. They include so-called food noise or intrusive thoughts of food; raging hunger; and decreased feelings of fullness when they eat.
“These drugs are just a super-suppressor of these native signals,” Rothberg said. “And we should expect that’s going to occur.”
Tara Rothenhoefer, 48, of Trinity, Florida, lost more than 200 pounds after joining a clinical trial for Mounjaro nearly four years ago. She now takes the lowest dose of the drug every four to eight weeks, but she worries when her weight fluctuates by a few pounds.
“It scares the daylights out of me to see the numbers on the scale going up,” she said.
Some patients who stop the drugs and start again find they can’t tolerate the medication, winding up with severe gastrointestinal side effects, Acosta said. Others find the drugs don’t work as well when they restart them, Saunders added. But there’s no data on the long-term effects of intermittent use.
“I don’t think it’s a strategy that will work for most individuals, but it could be an option for select patients,” Saunders said.
Donna Cooper has heard that people gain back weight when they stop the drugs, but she hopes to be an exception. She’s on her last box of Wegovy injections. Once she’s done, Cooper said she’ll just continue with a strict diet and exercise plan.
I just needed a crutch to get everything back in order,” said Cooper, who has gone from a size 16 to a size 10. “And I am excited to be done.""

2024-01-19T23:26:47.930Z,A downed power line in Oregon killed 3 people. Here’s what to do if facing that danger.,NBC News,"A deadly winter storm has hammered the Pacific Northwest this week, creating slippery, icy conditions.
Three people in Portland, Oregon — a woman, her boyfriend and her 15-year-old brother — were electrocuted Wednesday after slipping on ice near a live power line. A large tree branch likely fell onto utility wires, then knocked one of those wires onto the couple’s SUV.
Ice buildup can weigh down tree branches and power lines, causing them to snap and fall — thereby putting people at risk of electrocution.
According to Portland Fire & Rescue, the couple exited their SUV after the line fell onto their car, and at some point, their feet touched the ground while their bodies were still touching the vehicle.
“They became part of the active electrical circuit which resulted in their deaths,” the fire department said in a news release.
The Associated Press reported that the man and woman — who was pregnant — each slipped on icy concrete as they attempted to retrieve their 9-month-old baby from the car. The woman’s teenage brother was electrocuted when he came out to help.
The baby survived after an 18-year-old neighbor removed the infant from his father’s chest.
The news has prompted safety experts to share tips on how to approach dangerous situations involving live wires.
If a power line falls on your car while you're inside, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention advises staying in the vehicle, keeping the ignition on and calling 911.
That's because the ground near a downed power line can be energized, as can any standing water nearby. (Although perfectly pure water does not conduct electricity, the water we encounter in the real world almost always has something dissolved in it.) Even fallen branches or trees should be avoided because live wires can get entangled in them, and wood can conduct electricity when wet.
“The only time you ever want to exit the car near downed power lines is if the vehicle is catching fire,” said Michael Morse, a professor of electrical engineering at the University of San Diego. In that case, he suggested, try to push the door open and jump from the vehicle without touching the car and the ground at the same time.
“I’ve sadly done a number of cases where people exiting vehicles are killed because they touch an electrically live vehicle while touching the earth and they become a direct conduit,” Morse said.
The Electrical Safety Foundation, an organization that publishes safety tips to prevent electrically related deaths, suggests that to seek help without leaving a car, people can try honking the horn but should instruct others not to get too close.
If you’re driving and approach a downed power line, do not drive over it, the foundation says. Morse said you can back the car away from the line if it’s safe to do so, but generally people should sit tight and call 911.
“When you see a downed power line, stay at least 35 feet away, which is about three car lengths or so,” said Daniel Majano, program manager at the Electrical Safety Foundation.
Most people can’t tell the difference between a power line and a telecommunication or cable line, Majano said, so you should assume any downed line is dangerous and call local authorities.
Morse, who has consulted for roughly 600 legal cases involving electrical injuries, said the young woman who rescued the baby on Wednesday was lucky not to have been injured.
“Your average citizen shouldn’t go rushing into an electrically dangerous area because they may in fact cause their own death and contribute nothing to saving somebody,” he said.
Touching someone who’s in contact with a downed wire could be deadly, because human bodies can conduct and spread electricity, according to utility company National Grid.
The Electrical Safety Foundation says the proper way to move away from a downed wire is to shuffle with small steps, keeping both feet together and on the ground at all times to minimize the chances of being shocked.
In general, the Electrical Safety Foundation advises people to stay at least 10 feet away from any power line, even if it hasn’t fallen.
“Let’s say you’re clearing snow off your roof or you’re doing some sort of home improvement,” Majano said. “The electricity can jump from those power lines to, let’s say, a metal ladder or a paintbrush.”

2024-01-30T19:25:30.704Z,"Medicare to kick off first drug price negotiations, and it could get heated",NBC News,"The government is set to begin negotiating prices on the 10 costliest prescription drugs covered by Medicare this week, setting the stage for a fierce tug of war between U.S. officials and drugmakers as the Biden administration attempts to lower soaring prescription drug costs for older adults.
Medicare provides health insurance coverage to more than 65 million people in the U.S., according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS.
The negotiations, as mandated by the Inflation Reduction Act, are slated to run through Aug. 1 before final prices are announced on Sept. 1. It's uncharted territory for Medicare, which has never before been able to directly haggle with drugmakers over prices.
“I expect negotiations to be intense,” said Lawrence Gostin, director of the O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University. “Big Pharma is likely to dig in its heels and use a variety of strategies, including fierce negotiations.”
By Thursday, the CMS is expected to send its first pricing offer to each drug company that makes the 10 selected drugs, said Juliette Cubanski, a Medicare expert with KFF, a nonpartisan group that studies health policy issues.
The 10 drugs under negotiation are:
An analysis published in January by the Commonwealth Fund, a research group focused on health care, found that the U.S. retail prices — prices charged by pharmacists to patients or insurers before discounts or rebates — for the 10 drugs were three to eight times higher compared to other countries of similar size and wealth.
Another report from the Commonwealth Fund, published in September, found that in 2022, more than 1 in 7 older adults with Medicare said that they didn’t fill a prescription because of the high cost of drugs.
The negotiations will begin in earnest Thursday morning, when Medicare presents its opening price offer for the drugs. Both sides will have the opportunity to go back-and-forth, making counter offers over several months before they agree on a final price, Cubanski said.
The new prices will go into effect in 2026.
A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said the Biden administration will disclose only the final negotiated prices, not the opening bids.
Julie Masow, a spokesperson for Novartis, told NBC News in a statement that the drugmaker does not plan to make the government’s initial pitch public.
Allison Schneider, a spokesperson for Novo Nordisk, said the company “intends to evaluate CMS’s initial offer and will decide how to respond.”
The makers of the remaining eight drugs did not respond to requests for comment.
It remains unclear how steep the price cuts will be, said Stacie Dusetzina, a health policy professor at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. The Inflation Reduction Act established a minimum price discount of 25% for a drug that is 9 to 12 years old. For older drugs, the minimum discounts could be as high as 60%, she said.
Dusetzina said she expects that if a company is initially asked for a discount of around 25% on the price of its drug, they would likely agree to it.
“That is the best-case scenario,” she said. “There’s nowhere to go.”
While at the lower end, 25% “would actually be a pretty big discount,” she added.
Imbruvica, a blood cancer drug, for example, cost the federal government about $2.9 billion in 2020 alone. A 25% discount would provide the government savings of around $560 million, according to an analysis published in the Journal of Managed Care & Specialty Pharmacy.
Those savings are expected to trickle down to older adults who are prescribed the drugs through lower out-of-pocket costs at the pharmacy counter, said Gretchen Jacobson, vice president of the Medicare program at the Commonwealth Fund.
People on Medicare could also see lower monthly premiums, Cubanski said.
Adults on Medicare will likely see more savings in the next several years. In 2027, negotiated prices will go into effect for 15 more drugs, followed by another 15 drugs in 2028 and 20 more in each subsequent year.
Of course, none of this will happen if the drugmakers are successful in their lawsuits seeking to dismantle the Inflation Reduction Act, Gostin said.
In June, Merck announced a lawsuit against the federal government over the negotiation provision. Other drugmakers, including Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca, have since filed similar suits. On Wednesday, a district court in Delaware is scheduled to hear oral arguments in the AstraZeneca case.
“​​I see a rough ride for the Biden administration,” Gostin said.
In a statement, Alex Schriver, a spokesperson for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, or PhRMA, a group that represents the drug industry, said the negotiations are not in the best interests of patients.
“Government bureaucrats are operating behind closed doors to set medicine prices without disclosing for months how they arrived at the price or how much patient and provider input was used,” Schriver said. “This lack of transparency and unchecked authority will have lasting consequences for patients long after this administration is gone.”

2024-02-05T15:36:29.218Z,How the anti-vaccine movement is downplaying the danger of measles,NBC News,"As outbreaks of measles spread throughout the world, anti-vaccine activists aren’t just urging people not to get vaccinated — they’re taking a page from a well-worn playbook, falsely downplaying the dangers from the highly contagious respiratory disease.
“The truth is, measles is not a super severe serious illness when you’re a child,” Mary Holland, president of the country’s best-funded anti-vaccine organization, Children’s Health Defense, said last week on the group’s online morning show. Children’s Health Defense was founded by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who took a leave from the organization in April to run for president.
Holland, a lawyer, called government responses to recent outbreaks “fearmongering” and “crying wolf.”
“It’s a couple days of spots and then you move on,” she said.
But national health agencies warn the fear of measles is well-founded.
Measles — a disease so contagious it acts as a bellwether for threats from other infectious diseases — is marked by fever, flu-like symptoms and an itchy rash, and sometimes comes with dire complications including pneumonia, seizures and brain damage. For every 1,000 cases of  measles, about 200 children may be hospitalized, 50 may get pneumonia, one child may develop brain swelling along with deafness or disability, and between one and three may die.
Despite the availability of an incredibly effective vaccine, the disease is spreading worldwide. The reasons behind the surge are complex. For countries in Africa, the Middle East and Southeast Asia, there are issues of access; childhood vaccine campaigns suffered when Covid weakened already-stretched public health systems. Europe, the U.K. and the U.S. experienced similar, if smaller-scale, disruptions to their childhood vaccine programs during Covid. Rising vaccine skepticism plays a smaller but significant part.
Last month, the World Health Organization announced an “alarming” 45-fold increase in measles in Europe from 2022 to 2023, while health officials in the U.K. declared a “national incident” stemming from an outbreak of hundreds of cases in the West Midlands, warning of a likely spread to other regions. U.K. officials attribute the rise to a drop in vaccine uptake.
Across the U.S., state and regional health agencies have been announcing cases of measles in their communities. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued an advisory last week for providers to “stay alert” for measles cases, citing 23 confirmed cases since Dec. 1, mostly among unvaccinated children.
Anti-vaccine activists and influencers are unfazed.
Mother and wellness influencers with tens of thousands of followers on Instagram have reacted to the recent outbreaks with posts warning their audience not to buy into the hype. “As the news tries to fear-monger about the measles ‘outbreak,’” one home birth advocate posted, “remember that the vaccine is more dangerous than the actual illness.” (This is false.)
Other mom influencers posted memes tapping into nostalgia for a time when some parents intentionally exposed their young children to measles, mumps and rubella with “parties,” as the diseases were considered serious, but less harmful for young children. These planned contaminations largely ended with the availability of vaccines, which offered the preferable opportunity to avoid the diseases in childhood and beyond.
Before a measles vaccine became available in 1963, the U.S. saw an estimated millions of cases per year,  tens of thousands of related hospitalizations, and hundreds of deaths, according to the CDC. At the time, compared to polio and smallpox, measles was considered a milder disease, but riding a wave of success from those immunization efforts, the federal government launched a vaccine push to eradicate measles and by 1969, cases had fallen dramatically.
While pockets of distrust for vaccines have existed as long as vaccines themselves, certain events — most notably the publication of since-discredited research by disgraced doctor Andrew Wakefield — supercharged the anti-vaccine movement and have powered the enduring and false belief that vaccines lead to autism and other maladies.
The tactic of minimizing the threat of vaccine-preventable illnesses is nothing new. Anti-vaccine activists in the 1800s dismissed the dangers of smallpox as “senseless panic” ginned up by doctors and health officials. And during Covid — a disease that claimed over 1 million American lives — activists claimed through debunked documentaries and conspiracy-theory-laden books that the vaccines were more dangerous than the disease.
In 2019, as measles surged through the U.S. at a rate not seen in decades, then-President Donald Trump reversed his previously hesitant stance to urge parents to get their children vaccinated. In response, weeks later, the second best-funded anti-vaccine organization, the Informed Consent Action Network, released “Measles for Dumbies,” a video guide for how to “identify, understand and refute mainstream misinformation,” about what Del Bigtree, the group’s executive director and now director of communications for the Kennedy campaign, called “a benign childhood disease.”
By December 2019, a measles outbreak in Samoa — where anti-vaccine activists including Kennedy had advocated against measles-mumps-rubella vaccines — had killed dozens of children and babies, underscoring the consequences of low vaccination rates. Kennedy told NBC News last year that he discounts the official cause of those deaths, believing despite evidence to the contrary that the vaccine, not measles, was to blame.
Kennedy has made light of measles for years. In 2021, at an Amish country fair in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, he praised low vaccine rates and warned the audience that the government was “coming for the Amish.”
“I am a measles survivor,” Kennedy said sarcastically as the crowd roared with laughter. “It was extraordinary. I’m very, very lucky to have lived through that nightmare because we had to stay at home and watch TV the whole week with all of my brothers and sisters. It was horrible.”
“What is the cure for measles?” he continued. “Chicken soup and Vitamin A. Neither of those things can be patented.”
Kennedy went on to suggest that pharmaceutical companies were ignoring harms from the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine — a claim without evidence — to make “permanent customers” of injured children.
Asked for a comment, Stefanie Spear, the Kennedy campaign’s press secretary, said in an email: “The reason Mr. Kennedy was making light of measles infection is because his generation considered it a routine childhood illness.”
Spear added that measles deaths were relatively rare before the vaccine was invented. “Virtually every one of our grandparents who were alive before 1960 caught the measles and survived it,” she said. “We would not be having this conversation if our grandparents had died from measles.”
Nostalgic stories like Kennedy’s remain one of the anti-vaccine movement’s go-to modern talking points, illustrated most often by a piece of pop culture posing as evidence — a 50-year-old episode of “The Brady Bunch.” The clip, in which the Brady children contract and recover from measles with little fanfare or seeming concern from their sitcom parents, went so viral in 2019 that a former star from the show spoke out against it. The clip is going around again in anti-vaccine circles.
It’s a campaign fueled by selective memory, and one with senseless consequences, said Dr. Paul Offit, the director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and a frequent target of the anti-vaccine movement.
“Most everybody who was born before a vaccine was available had measles. I had measles as did all my friends. I lived, but not everybody did,” Offit said. “It is galling that people think if they don’t see somebody die right next to them then it never happened.”
Offit mentioned the 1991 measles outbreak in Philadelphia that started in a church community. By the time health officials had it contained, 1,400 people, mostly unvaccinated preschoolers, had been infected. Nine children died.
Measles means “suffering, hospitalizations, ICU admissions and the occasional death,” Offit said. “Kids with measles are sick. It’s a miserable illness.”
Less talked about, Offit said, is an extremely rare condition, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, or SSPE, a fatal disorder of the brain that can manifest about seven years after a measles infection.
“This is a preventable illness,” Offit said. ""We could eliminate this virus from the world if we wanted to.”
Elimination would rely on vaccines, which are widely available, safe, effective, and under constant threat by a growing anti-vaccine movement.

2024-01-17T14:03:12.126Z,Protein may help protect women against many types of chronic disease,NBC News,"A diet rich in protein — especially plant protein — may keep women healthier as they age, a new study suggests.
In an analysis of data from more than 48,000 women, researchers found that each 3% increase in the amount of plant protein consumed was associated with a 38% higher likelihood of staying healthy as the women got older, meaning fewer or no chronic diseases, better physical mobility and little cognitive decline, according to the report published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition on Wednesday.
“In particular, plant protein, seemed to be favorably associated with good mental health status and a lack of impairments in memory,” said the study’s lead author, Andres Ardisson Korat, a scientist at the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University.
“The advantage of consuming more plant protein — compared to other nutrients in the diet — is that plant protein is associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease and other chronic conditions,” he said, adding that plant protein also promotes good physical function by enhancing muscle synthesis.
Moreover, plant protein “comes from food sources that typically contain high-quality carbohydrates, containing more fiber, vitamins and minerals, and antioxidants,” Ardisson Korat said.
To see how protein consumption affects healthy aging, the researchers looked at surveys from more than 48,000 participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a long-term investigation into the risk factors for major diseases in women. The data, which was collected every four years from 1984 to 2016, tracked how frequently people ate certain foods. At the start of the study, the women were ages 38 to 59 and were in good physical and mental health.
For the new analysis, the researchers calculated protein intake by multiplying the number of times each food item was consumed by its protein content and then totaled the amount of protein across all food items.
For women to be categorized as healthy by the time they were between 70 to 93, they had to be free from the major chronic health conditions associated with aging in the U.S.: cancer (except for nonmelanoma skin cancer), Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, stroke, kidney failure, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS.
Adult women, 31 to 59, need the equivalent of 5 ounces to 6 ounces daily, according to the recommended dietary allowance. A 3% increase in protein in a 2,000-calorie diet — typical for middle-age women — is 60 calories or half an ounce of protein, Ardisson Korat said.
This amount of protein could be found in one cup of cooked beans or cooked lentils.
However, with every calorie of protein added to the diet, something else needs to be switched out, such as refined carbs or unhealthy fat, Ardisson Korat said.
Early in the study, the sources of plant proteins included bread, vegetables, pasta, potatoes, nuts, beans and peanut butter.
Plant foods that are relatively high in protein include:
The women who ate more plant proteins were 46% more likely to be healthy into their later years, the analysis showed. Women who consumed more animal protein, such as beef, chicken, milk, fish and cheese, however, were 6% less likely to stay healthy as they aged.
However, because the women in the Nurses' Health Study were mostly white, it’s unclear how the findings would apply to other groups.
The new report amplifies results of earlier studies that have shown that people who consume plant proteins, especially those who are vegetarians, tend to be healthier with lower cholesterol levels, a better ability to burn calories and lower levels of inflammation and dementia.
Nutrition studies are rarely done as controlled clinical trials, and the new research was based on food questionnaires, so it doesn't prove that increasing plant proteins helps with healthy aging.
However, the many years of follow-up provide confidence in the findings, said Marie-Pierre St-Onge, an associate nutrition professor at the Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York City.
She said the focus on prolonged health as opposed to disease or death was refreshing.
“While we all want an increased life expectancy, we really want those extra years to be in a healthy state,” St-Onge said.
Dr. Deepak Bhatt, a cardiologist who is the director of the Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital in New York City, said the finding about plant proteins is backed by other evidence that they are good for reducing heart attacks and cancer risk.
“I would encourage both women and men to adopt a plant-based diet,” he said.
Dr. Kathryn Lindley, a cardiologist who is the director of the Women’s Heart Center at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, noted that there could be other reasons people who were eating a lot of plant protein might have been healthier in their old age.
For example, the women eating more protein might have healthier diets overall or they might be living a healthier lifestyle overall, she said. Or they may have been able to afford more quality food choices and had better access to health care and exercise facilities.
Yet, even with limitations, the study is ""a good starting point,"" Lindley said.

2024-02-01T21:11:11.945Z,Why are Black men at greater risk for prostate cancer?,NBC News,"Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin apologized this week for not being more transparent about his prostate cancer diagnosis, acknowledging that the news had not only affected him but also shocked many others, “especially in the Black community.”
""It was a gut punch,"" Austin said Thursday at a news briefing.
The diagnosis — which was made public Jan. 9, about a week after he had been hospitalized with complications from cancer surgery, blindsiding even the White House — has renewed public discussion around prostate cancer in the Black community.
Why does it appear to be so prevalent in black men, how soon is too soon to seek screening, what are the early symptoms and when is an appropriate time to tell loved ones?
All men are at risk for prostate cancer, the second most common cancer among men in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The American Cancer Society estimates that in 2024, there will be nearly 300,000 new cases of prostate cancer and just over 35,000 deaths.
Whether prostate cancer is, in fact, more common in Black men than other groups remains an open question, said Dr. Abhinav Khanna, a urologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.
But it is sometimes more aggressive in Black men, he said.
Black men in the U.S., Khanna said, are two times more likely to die from prostate cancer than white men.
“Not all prostate cancer is lethal, but we have seen that black men do have a higher risk of dying from prostate cancer,” he said.
One potential reason is that Black men — depending on their socioeconomic status — may not get screened as vigilantly as white and Asian men do in the U.S., leading to more advanced cancer diagnoses and worse outcomes, said Dr. Ravi Munver, vice chairman of the department of urology at Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey.
A study published in the journal Cancer in 2022, for example, found that outcomes for Black men with prostate cancer are worse because they are less likely to be screened or to receive treatment.
Dr. Adam Murphy, an associate professor of urology at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago, said genetics can also play a role in prostate cancer risk.
Being of West African descent, for example, is a potential risk factor, Murphy said. Other risk factors include age and family history, he said.
“If you have first-degree relatives who have prostate cancer, or even secondary-degree relatives, it increases your risk a little bit,” he said. “And then there are related cancers that run in families like breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and other germline genetic mutations that can increase your risk, like Lynch syndrome.”
For the vast majority of men, there won’t be any signs or symptoms until the disease is far more progressed, experts said. Dr. Samuel Haywood, urologic oncologist at Cleveland Clinic, said symptoms include:
Before symptoms begin to appear, the only screening for prostate cancer is a blood test called a prostate-specific antigen, or PSA. In 2018 the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommended that men ages 55 to 69 should make an individual decision whether to get a PSA test. The task force advised against prostate cancer screening for men 70 and older.
Munver recommended that Black men who are at increased risk for prostate cancer should start screening at ages 40 to 45, aligning with recommendations from the American Urological Association.
“If it’s caught early, prostate cancer is very treatable, very curable,” said Khanna.
Munver understood why Austin didn’t tell the public about his diagnosis sooner.
Prostate cancer is a very sensitive issue for men, he said. It’s often only after they are diagnosed, or come to terms with their diagnosis or undergo treatment, that men are more comfortable talking about their diagnosis, he said.
“It’s a very personal issue,” he said. “They realize that prostate cancer is one of the cancers that’s very treatable or curable in men and not necessarily a death sentence.""
Murphy, of Northwestern Medicine, noted that there is also a stigma for men generally.
“The way that men engage with health care is very different than what women do because of a lack of having to go into see OB-GYN,” he said. “And so men are oftentimes lost after they graduate from high school or college.”
“I think what his action did was to kind of highlight the fact that even though he was duty bound to tell that fact, you know, to the White House, that same stigma persisted, that's how strong it was,” Murphy said.

2024-02-28T22:02:42.639Z,CDC recommends spring Covid booster for older adults,NBC News,"People at higher risk for the most severe complications of Covid — primarily those ages 65 and older — should get a booster shot this spring, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Wednesday.
The CDC's recommendation came hours after the agency's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted in support of the extra dose.
Another round of the vaccine given within the next few months would offer the best protection possible, the advisers said, ahead of another likely rise in illness this summer.
Over the past four years, there’s tended to be both a winter and a summer wave of Covid, with cases peaking in January and August, respectively, according to the CDC.
For that reason, advisers to the CDC said that the approach to Covid vaccination is still different from the strategy used for the flu, which typically only peaks during the winter.
“I hope that we are moving in the direction of getting more flu-like where there’s a really clear season, but I don’t think that we are there yet,” Megan Wallace, a CDC epidemiologist, said during a Wednesday meeting of the advisory committee.
The additional dose should be given at least four months after a previous dose for healthy older adults, or at least three months after a Covid infection. People with compromised immune systems may need additional shots.
“This gives us a great opportunity to remind people about the importance of vaccination,” said Marvia Jones, director of the Kansas City Health Department in Missouri, who was not involved in Wednesday’s ACIP meeting. “We certainly are concerned about the vulnerability of people in that age group when it comes to Covid-19.”
The spring booster will be the same shot that was approved last fall, which was formulated to target the XBB.1.5 subvariant. The vaccine is effective against the JN.1 subvariant, which is currently causing the vast majority — more than 96% — of new Covid infections in the United States.
On Wednesday, the advisory committee presented new data showing that the shot lowered the odds of being hospitalized with Covid in otherwise healthy people 65 years and older by up to 54%.
The CDC will publish additional details on that research Thursday.
Covid hospitalizations peaked at the beginning of January, with 35,000 hospitalizations a week. By Feb. 7, Covid hospitalizations had fallen to around 20,000 a week.
Throughout the last year, weekly hospital admissions for Covid never dipped below 6,000, the CDC said. The vast majority have been among older adults, 65 and older.
The number of Covid deaths are also decreasing. Still, at the lowest point last summer, the CDC reported about 500 Covid deaths a week.

2024-01-11T19:14:00.678Z,'Obamacare' sign-ups surge to a record 20 million,NBC News,"Some 20 million people have signed up for health insurance this year through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces, a record-breaking figure.
President Joe Biden will likely proclaim those results regularly on the campaign trail for months to come as former President Donald Trump, the Republican front-runner, vows to dismantle the Obama-era program.
The Biden administration announced Wednesday morning that 20 million have enrolled for coverage on the marketplace, days before the open enrollment period is set to close Tuesday.
The latest enrollment projections mean a quarter more Americans have signed up for coverage this year compared to last — another record-breaking year when 16.3 million enrolled in the program. Signs-ups spiked after Biden took office, with Democrats rolling out a series of tax breaks that give millions of Americans access to low cost plans, some with zero-dollar premiums.
“We must build upon this progress and make these lower health care premiums permanent,” Biden said in a statement. “But extreme Republicans have blocked these efforts at every turn.”
The nation’s top health official on Wednesday credited piqued interest in the coverage with an aggressive campaign to get people enrolled. The administration has worked with nonprofits across the the country, including in predominately Black and Latino communities, like South Florida, to get new people into coverage. The administration has also invested millions more dollars into hiring navigators who help people enroll, a program that was decimated while President Donald Trump, a longtime critic of so-called “Obamacare,” was in office.
“The previous administration made no effort to let people know what they could get,” Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said during an interview with MSNBC’s “ Morning Joe.” “We’re out there, we’re not waiting for them to come to us. We’re going to them.”
But the increased enrollment news that the Biden administration celebrated on Wednesday has not come without cost. Some of the millions of new enrollees have only turned to the marketplace because they have been booted off Medicaid, the nearly free health care coverage offered to the poorest Americans or those with disabilities. The health plans they purchase through the marketplace will have higher premiums and copays for services.
Roughly 14.5 million Americans have been recently kicked off Medicaid after the federal government lifted a 3-year ban that barred states from removing ineligible people from the government-sponsored health insurance. States began purging millions of people from Medicaid last year, during an error-plagued process that has left thousands of children and pregnant women erroneously without health insurance coverage in some states.
Trump, meanwhile, is regularly threatening on the campaign trail to undo the Biden administration’s work on former President Barack Obama’s signature health care law.
“Obamacare is a catastrophe, nobody talks about it,” Trump said at a rally in Iowa on Saturday. The former president went on to criticize the late Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona for blocking GOP efforts to scuttle the law more than five years ago.
Although open enrollment for health insurance plans purchased through the Affordable Care Act ends on Jan. 16., people who have been removed from Medicaid may be eligible to enroll through the end of July.

2024-03-02T00:22:04.190Z,Does yogurt reduce risk of diabetes? The FDA says it might.,NBC News,"Food makers can advertise that regularly eating yogurt may reduce the risk of Type 2 diabetes without objection from the Food and Drug Administration, the agency announced on Friday.
The decision came in response to a petition that Danone North America — the food giant behind major brands including Dannon, Activia, Wallaby Organic and Silk — submitted in 2018. The company sought FDA acknowledgement that it would not object if Danone marketed yogurt as able to reduce the risk of Type 2 diabetes.
The FDA confirmed on Friday that it will not oppose the claim, with some caveats. Any language to consumers must note that the evidence is limited and that eating two cups (three servings) of yogurt per week is the threshold for reducing the risk of Type 2 diabetes, it said.
Danone submitted its petition as part of a standard process for what the FDA calls “qualified health claims.” Such claims do not require the agency's approval, but companies petition the FDA to define the specific language they can safely use without the agency coming after them for making false claims.
Danone’s petition cited the nutrient profile of proteins, vitamins and low sodium in yogurt, alongside studies supporting the link between regular yogurt consumption and a reduced risk of diabetes and related conditions.
“The petition also noted that the evidence supports the health effects of yogurt as a food rather than related to any single nutrient or compound and thus is independent of fat or sugar content,” the FDA said in its announcement.
Sugar and fat levels in yogurt vary widely, of course. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that although some low-fat or unsweetened yogurts are low in calories and a healthy source of protein, vitamin D and calcium, flavored yogurts are often high in added sugars and should be limited. Research has long demonstrated a link between high consumption of added sugars and an increased risk of Type 2 diabetes.
Some of the evidence supporting yogurt’s health benefits comes from a 2022 study, which found that eating fermented dairy products, especially yogurt, “may offer protection against the development” of Type 2 diabetes.
Yogurt is also part of the Mediterranean diet, alongside other staples such as fresh produce, whole grains, olive oil and fish. A 2020 study found that adhering to the diet significantly reduced the risk of Type 2 diabetes. However, a 2016 study did not find any link between dairy consumption and the disease.
Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, who provided scientific feedback to Danone when the company drafted its petition, said the FDA’s decision is sensible, “given the growing evidence for health benefits of fermented yogurt in particular.”
But Mozaffarian, director of The Food as Medicine Institute at Tufts University, emphasized that food can’t be marketed as preventing or curing a disease outright — because then it would be considered a drug.
“I think that’s actually a significant problem both for the food industry and the FDA because now that we’re learning that food actually is medicine, and food can, in some cases, treat or cure disease, there’s no regulatory pathway to get there,” he said.

2024-03-07T10:00:40.000Z,Tennessee vaccine law pits parental rights against public health,NBC News,"Gayle Borne has fostered more than 300 children in Springfield, Tennessee. She’s cared for kids who have rarely seen a doctor — kids so neglected that they cannot speak. Such children are now even more vulnerable because of a law Tennessee passed last year that requires the direct consent of birth parents or legal guardians for every routine childhood vaccination. Foster parents, social workers, and other caregivers cannot provide permission.
In January, Borne took a foster baby, born extremely premature at just over 2 pounds, to her first doctor’s appointment. The health providers said that without the consent of the child’s mother, they couldn’t vaccinate her against diseases like pneumonia, hepatitis B, and polio. The mother hasn’t been located, so a social worker is now seeking a court order to permit immunizations. “We are just waiting,” Borne said. “Our hands are tied.”
Tennessee’s law has also stymied grandmothers and other caregivers who accompany children to routine appointments when parents are at work, in drug and alcohol rehabilitation clinics, or otherwise unavailable. The law claims to “give parents back the right to make medical decisions for their children.”
Framed in the rhetoric of choice and consent, it is one of more than a dozen recent and pending pieces of legislation nationwide that pit parental freedom against community and children’s health. In actuality, they create obstacles to vaccination, the foundation of pediatric care.
Such policies have another effect. They seed doubt about vaccine safety in a climate rife with medical misinformation. The trend has exploded as politicians and social media influencers make false claims about risks, despite studies showing otherwise.
Doctors traditionally give caregivers vaccine information and get their permission before delivering more than a dozen childhood immunizations that defend against measles, polio, and other debilitating diseases.
But now, Tennessee’s law demands that birth parents attend routine appointments and sign consent forms for every vaccine given over two or more years. “The forms could have a chilling effect,” said Dr. Jason Yaun, a Memphis pediatrician and past president of the Tennessee chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics.
“People who promote parental rights on vaccines tend to downplay the rights of children,” said Dorit Reiss, a vaccine policy researcher at the University of California Law-San Francisco.
Misinformation coupled with a parental rights movement that shifts decision-making away from public health expertise has contributed to the lowest childhood vaccine rates in a decade.
This year, legislators in Arizona, Iowa, and West Virginia have introduced related consent bills. A “Parents’ Bill of Rights” amendment in Oklahoma seeks to ensure that parents know they can exempt their children from school vaccine mandates along with lessons on sex education and AIDS. In Florida, the state's surgeon general recently defied guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by telling parents they could send unvaccinated children to a school during a measles outbreak.
Last year, Mississippi began allowing exemptions from school vaccine requirements for religious reasons because of a lawsuit funded by the Informed Consent Action Network, which is listed as a leading source of anti-vaccine disinformation by the Center for Countering Digital Hate. A post on ICAN’s website said it “could not be more proud” in Mississippi to “restore the right of every parent in this country to have his or her convictions respected and not trampled by the government.”
Even if some bills fail, Reiss fears, the revived parental rights movement may eventually abolish policies that require routine immunizations to attend school. At a recent campaign rally, former President Donald Trump, the likely GOP nominee, said, “I will not give one penny to any school that has a vaccine mandate.”
The movement dates to the wake of the 1918 influenza pandemic, when some parents pushed back against progressive reforms that required school attendance and prohibited child labor. Since then, tensions between state measures and parental freedom have occasionally flared over a variety of issues. Vaccines became a prominent one in 2021, as the movement found common ground with people skeptical of Covid vaccines.
“The parental rights movement didn’t start with vaccines,” Reiss said, “but the anti-vaccine movement has allied themselves with it and has expanded their reach by riding on its coattails.”
In Tennessee, anti-vaccine activists and libertarian-leaning organizations railed against the state’s health department in 2021 when it recommended covid vaccines to minors, following CDC guidance. Gary Humble, executive director of the conservative group Tennessee Stands, asked legislators to blast the health department for advising masks and vaccination, suggesting the department “could be dissolved and reconstituted at your pleasure.”
Backlash also followed a notice sent to doctors from Dr. Michelle Fiscus, then the state’s immunization director. She reminded them that they didn’t need parental permission to vaccinate consenting adolescents 14 or older, according to a decades-old state rule called the Mature Minor Doctrine.
In the weeks that followed, state legislators threatened to defund the health department and pressured it into scaling back covid vaccine promotion, as revealed by The Tennessean. Fiscus was abruptly fired. “Today I became the 25th of 64 state and territorial immunization program directors to leave their position during this pandemic,” she wrote in a statement. “That’s nearly 40% of us.” Tennessee’s Covid death rate climbed to one of the nation’s highest by mid-2022.
By the time two state legislators introduced a bill to reverse the Mature Minor Doctrine, the health department was silent on the proposal. Despite obstacles for foster children who would require a court order for routine immunizations, Tennessee’s Department of Children’s Services was silent, too.
Notably, the legislator who introduced the bill, Republican Rep. John Ragan, was among those simultaneously overseeing a review of the agency that would determine its leadership and budget for the coming years. “Children belong to their families, not the state,” said Ragan as he presented the bill at a state hearing in April 2023.
Democratic Rep. Justin Pearson spoke out against the bill. It “doesn’t take into account people and children who are neglected,” he told Ragan. “We are legislating from a point of privilege and not recognizing the people who are not privileged in this way.”
Rather than address such concerns, Ragan referenced a Supreme Court ruling in favor of parental rights in 2000. Specifically, judges determined that a mother had legal authority to decide who could visit her daughters. Yet the Supreme Court has also done the opposite. For instance, it sided against a legal guardian who removed her child from school to proselytize for the Jehovah’s Witnesses.
Still, Ragan swiftly won the majority vote. Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, a Republican, signed the bill in May, making it effective immediately. Deborah Lowen, then the deputy commissioner of child health at the Department of Children’s Services, was flooded with calls from doctors who now face jailtime and fines for vaccinating minors without adequate consent. “I was and remain very disheartened,” she said.
Yaun, the Memphis pediatrician, said he was shaken as he declined to administer a first series of vaccines to an infant accompanied by a social worker. “That child is going into a situation where they are around other children and adults,” he said, “where they could be exposed to something we failed to protect them from.”
“We have had numerous angry grandparents in our waiting room who take kids to appointments because the parents are at work or down on their luck,” said Dr. Hunter Butler, a pediatrician in Springfield, Tennessee. “I once called a rehabilitation facility to find a mom and get her on the phone to get verbal consent to vaccinate her baby,” he said. “And it’s unclear if that was OK.”
Childhood immunization rates have dropped for three consecutive years in Tennessee. Nationwide, downward trends in measles vaccination led the CDC to estimate that a quarter million kindergartners are at risk of the highly contagious disease.
Communities with low vaccination rates are vulnerable as measles surges internationally. Confirmed measles cases in 2023 were almost double those in 2022 — a year in which the World Health Organization estimates that more than 136,000 people died from the disease globally. When travelers infected abroad land in communities with low childhood vaccination rates, the highly contagious virus can spread swiftly among unvaccinated people, as well as babies too young to be vaccinated and people with weakened immune systems.
“There’s a freedom piece on the other side of this argument,” said Caitlin Gilmet, communications director at the vaccine advocacy group SAFE Communities Coalition and Action Fund. “You should have the right to protect your family from preventable diseases.”
In late January, Gilmet and other child health advocates gathered in a room at the Tennessee Statehouse in Nashville, offering a free breakfast of fried chicken biscuits. They handed out flyers as legislators and their aides drifted in to eat. One pamphlet described the toll of a 2018-19 measles outbreak in Washington state that sickened 72 people, most of whom were unvaccinated, costing $76,000 in medical care, $2.3 million for the public health response, and an estimated $1 million in economic losses due to illness, quarantine, and caregiving.
Dr. Barb Dentz, an advocate with the grassroots group Tennessee Families for Vaccines, repeated that most of the state’s constituents support strong policies in favor of immunizations. Indeed, seven in 10 U.S. adults maintained that public schools should require vaccination against measles, mumps, and rubella, in a Pew Research Center poll last year. But numbers have been dropping.
“Protecting kids should be such a no-brainer,” Dentz told Republican Rep. Sam Whitson, later that morning in his office. Whitson agreed and reflected on an explosion of anti-vaccine misinformation. “Dr. Google and Facebook have been such a challenge,” he said. “Fighting ignorance has become a full-time job.”
Whitson was among a minority of Republicans who voted against Tennessee’s vaccine amendment last year. “The parental rights thing has really taken hold,” he said, “and it can be used for and against us.”

2024-02-21T15:33:27.031Z,More teens are turning to weight loss drugs,NBC News,"Demi Buckley initially tried to lose weight through diet and exercise, she said, but despite her efforts nothing worked.
The 16-year-old from Saginaw, Michigan, said it was really discouraging to watch other girls do the same workouts as her. “I didn’t know what was wrong with me or why I couldn’t lose weight,” she said.
Her mother, Deana, understood what it was like to struggle with her weight. She had bariatric surgery over 20 years ago, but didn’t lose as much weight as she needed to. It wasn’t until she started taking Mounjaro, a diabetes drug often prescribed off-label for weight loss, that she started to see results.
Those results opened Demi up to the idea of trying a weight loss drug herself.
She started Wegovy in March 2023, not long after the Food and Drug Administration approved it for use in adolescents as young as 12. She has since lost 58 pounds.
The weight loss, she said, hasn’t just transformed her appearance, but her mental health as well: Demi said she’s been able to go off medication for anxiety and depression.
“Now that I’m confident in my body, I can be confident in my mind, and that helps me a lot,” she said.
It’s a similar story for 15-year-old Brenden Gallagher of Los Angeles, California. He also had depression, and said his weight contributed to those feelings. After his doctor started prescribing him Mounjaro off-label three months ago, he said he’s lost 25 pounds. (The drug is not approved for people under 18).
Brenden’s parents, Dawn and Jayson Gallagher, said they have already noticed differences in his confidence and mood.
“He’s really starting to come out of his shell now,” Dawn said. “He’s trying basketball, he’s trying after-school programs, where before he would just stay in his bedroom. Now I’m seeing almost like a whole ‘nother child.”
Demi and Brenden are part of a growing number of teens turning to powerful new weight loss medications. According to data from health care analytics platform PurpleLab, in 2023, about 4,000 prescriptions of semaglutide, sold under the brand names Wegovy and Ozempic, were written for children ages 12 to 17.
The decision to put a teenager on a weight loss drug may sound extreme, but it falls in line with the latest recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics. Last year, the influential group added anti-obesity medications as part of its guidelines for treating obesity in kids ages 12 and up. Behavioral and lifestyle modifications — such as diet and exercise — are still considered the first line of treatment, but for kids and teens in which those aren’t enough, pediatricians can now prescribe medication.
Dr. Joan Han, the chief of pediatric endocrinology and diabetes at Mount Sinai Health System in New York City, said that a person’s genetics play a large role in his or her weight.
With that understanding, Han said, “it would make sense that sheer willpower is not necessarily going to fix excess weight gain.”
The AAP’s recommendations come as obesity rates continue to rise in children and teens in the United States. Fifteen million children and teens have obesity, and the percentage of kids impacted by it has tripled over the last three decades, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Obesity can put kids at higher risk of developing high blood pressure, high cholesterol, Type 2 diabetes and obstructive sleep apnea.
Dr. Sheela Magge, director of pediatric endocrinology at Johns Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore, has seen an increase in cases of more severe obesity-related conditions in children, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
“Some of the conditions that we almost exclusively used to see in adults, we are seeing them in children,” said Magge, who added that it’s important to treat kids with obesity early because related conditions, like Type 2 diabetes, may progress faster in kids than they do in adults. What’s more, about 80% of kids with obesity will turn into adults with obesity.
The new class of drugs — which includes semaglutide — could make treatment easier.
Semaglutide is a GLP-1 agonist. Other examples include tirzepatide, found in Eli Lilly’s Mounjaro (approved for Type 2 diabetes) and Zepbound (approved for weight loss); and liraglutide, found in Novo Nordisk’s Saxenda (approved for weight loss).
Magge said that what makes the GLP-1s so appealing is “the combination of their effectiveness and the relative side effect profile” compared to other medications approved for weight loss.
Some of the common side effects are nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain.
Demi said that when she first started taking Wegovy, she would get nauseous when she exercised heavily and dizzy if she didn’t drink enough water.
The AAP’s recommendations, while welcomed by many doctors, were met with fierce pushback, including from groups concerned with eating disorders.
Other experts said they are concerned about the unintended consequences of the drugs, such possible effects on growth and development. Dr. Dan Cooper, a pediatric pulmonologist at UCI Health in Irvine, California, co-wrote a paper outlining such worries.
“We wrote this paper to kind of say, ‘Hey, let’s think about these things before we just started prescribing these medications for kids,’” Cooper said.
Wegovy’s drugmaker, Novo Nordisk, said in a statement that studies found their medicines “did not appear to affect growth,” adding that “the decision to prescribe an anti-obesity medication is at the discretion of the physician.”
The drugs are also extremely expensive, and insurance companies don’t always agree to cover them.
At first, Candice Mott, of Washington, D.C., wasn’t concerned about her daughter Jamison’s weight gain. She thought her daughter’s weight was normal, adding “she wasn’t heavier or bigger than me.” Mott said. “I figured she’d grow up and it would roll off.”
What alerted her to a larger problem was when she learned Jamison had elevated liver enzymes.
“I don’t want her to have a liver transplant when she’s 25, 26. She wants to be a doctor. I want her to be healthy,” Mott said.
She said Jamison tried losing weight; she was playing three sports and preparing her meals, but all that was unsuccessful. That’s when they decided to try a GLP-1 drug, but Mott hasn’t been able to get insurance to cover it.
Magge, from Johns Hopkins, prescribed Wegovy to Jamison because her BMI classified her as having obesity and because of her elevated liver enzymes. Magge has personally gone back-and-forth with the family’s private insurance company, outlining Jamison’s medical need for the medication.
Unfortunately, it’s a common occurrence, Magge said, adding that she’s rarely able to get weight loss medications covered for her patients.Nationwide shortages of the medications compound the problem, she said.
Magge also noted that her patients go through a full evaluation before being prescribed a weight loss medication.
“It’s a long visit,” she said. The team asks about home life, family history of obesity, and are screened for health conditions linked to obesity.
“It’s not like we just throw medicine at them without saying, ‘Exercise,’” Magge said. “This is after you’ve tried exercise, nutrition, then you can use this in addition.”

2024-03-13T21:57:18.197Z,"In two early trials, blood cancer treatment appears promising for deadly brain tumor",NBC News,"Two early trials published Wednesday showed promise in treating one of the deadliest types of cancer, glioblastoma.
The aggressive brain cancer, which took the lives of John McCain and Beau Biden, is only diagnosed at stage 4, and the five-year survival rate is around 10%.
The disease has no cure and, according to Dr. Michael Vogelbaum, chief of neurosurgery and program leader of neuro-oncology at Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Florida, there have been no new drug approvals in the past two decades that have extended the lives of patients with glioblastoma.
The two clinical trials published Wednesday were extremely small, conducted on just nine patients in total, and much more research is needed, with larger trials, to determine how effective the therapy might be in the long run.
“All of these results are preliminary but encouraging,” said Vogelbaum, who wasn’t involved with either trial.
In the two unrelated trials, a novel take on an existing treatment for blood cancer was shown to be safe and it shrank tumors –– at least temporarily.
Both studies looked at the effects of a personalized immunotherapy called chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy — CAR-T therapy for short — in patients whose glioblastoma had returned after their initial treatment.
CAR-T therapy involves harvesting a person’s own immune cells and modifying them in a lab to seek out specific tumor proteins. The cells are then reintroduced into the body where they replicate, creating a surge of cancer-fighting immune cells.
The treatment is highly effective for certain blood cancers, but scientists are still studying whether modified versions of CAR-T therapy can be used for solid tumors like glioblastoma. These tumors, which account for the majority of cancers, present challenges that blood cancers do not.
Many blood cancers are homogeneous, meaning their cells are uniform. This gives CAR-T therapy a clear target to latch onto and attack. But solid tumors tend to have a variety of different cell types that can differ within individual tumors. This is particularly true for glioblastoma, which contains a large number of abnormal-looking cells.
“We had previous experience using a regular CAR in brain tumors but it wasn’t enough,” said Dr. Marcela Maus, director of the Cellular Immunotherapy Program at the Massachusetts General Cancer Center in Boston. Maus led one of the new studies, the results of which were published in The New England Journal of Medicine.
The original studies testing CAR-T therapy for glioblastoma only had one target, which is how the therapy has worked in blood cancers.
The cells targeted a protein with a specific mutation, but Maus said that not everyone with glioblastoma had the mutation. What’s more, even in patients who had the mutation, not every one of their tumor cells necessarily had it. “Even if we got the right cells, we didn’t get all of them because other tumors had other targets,” she said.
Both phase 1 clinical trials used CAR-T cells that were programmed to attack two targets instead of one, with the hope that multiple targets would better equip the cells to destroy solid tumors.
“It gives you more shots on goal, at targeting the protein, because these are not completely overlapping targets on any given tumor,” said Dr. Vincent Lam, an assistant professor of oncology at the Johns Hopkins Cancer Center, who specializes in immunotherapies and wasn’t involved with either trial.
In Maus’ clinical trial, which included three patients, T-cells were engineered to seek out and attack a protein called EGRF that’s often found in abundance in glioblastoma tumors but is not present in healthy brain tissue. The second target was a variant of EGRF that’s also commonly found in the tumors.
When used to treat blood cancer, CAR-T cells are transferred back into the body intravenously. Maus’ team chose a more targeted approach for their experimental therapy: injecting the cells directly into the cerebrospinal fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord.
This prompted more of the cancer-fighting cells to stick around the site of the brain tumors and, the researchers hypothesized, would reduce the amount of the immunotherapy elsewhere in the body.
Confining the therapy to the brain was important: While the target, EGFR, is not found in healthy brain tissue, it is found in healthy cells elsewhere in the body. If the CAR-T cells went beyond the brain, they could potentially attack these cells.
To further prevent the CAR-T cells from escaping, the researchers bulked them up by binding them to an antibody, which made it more difficult for the cells to cross the blood-brain barrier and enter the bloodstream.
All three patients  — two who were in their 70s and one in her late 50s — responded quickly to the treatment. Brain scans showed their tumors shrunk significantly within a day of receiving the therapy. In the 57-year-old woman, an MRI taken five days after her infusion of the modified cells showed her tumor was nearly gone.
The results, however, were temporary.
“We’re still in the early phases of the study. Two patients had their disease recur in the first six months and we want to aim for something better,” Maus said.
While some CAR-T cells did pass beyond the brain, they didn’t do so in large enough numbers to cause damage, the trial found.
The other trial, published in Nature Medicine, included six patients with recurrent glioblastoma. Their CAR-T cells also sought out EGFR, but used another protein, called IL13Rα2, which is found in 75% of glioblastoma tumors, as their second target.
All six patients underwent radiation to shrink their tumors before they started the immunotherapy, and each was given a single injection of the cells.
The team also delivered the immunotherapy locally, injecting it directly into the cerebrospinal fluid. All of the patients saw a reduction in their tumor size within the first two days of treatment, and they also experienced a significant spike in active CAR-T cells in their spinal fluid for several weeks after injection, meaning the cells were successfully dividing as well as concentrating in the area surrounding tumors.
“That was striking to us. We didn’t expect that kind of expansion, proliferation and maintenance in the spinal fluid,” said Dr. Donald O’Rourke, director of the Glioblastoma Translational Center of Excellence at the Abramson Cancer Center at Penn Medicine in Philadelphia, who co-led the trial.
O’Rourke and his team also used two different doses to get closer to an understanding of what the ideal number of CAR-T cells is for an infusion.
The ideal number would provide the most potent therapeutic effect without causing side effects so severe they negate the cancer-killing benefits, but striking a balance is tricky.
CAR-T therapy is different from a regular drug; it’s considered a “living drug” because the modified cells keep dividing once they’re in the body, meaning the amount in the initial infusion isn’t the final amount a patient will have, O’Rourke said.
All immunotherapies come with risk of neurological side effects, including confusion, language difficulties and sleepiness. The trial found that these side effects came on more quickly when CAR-T cells were injected into the cerebrospinal fluid, but that starting with a lower dose may be able to remedy this. The first three patients were given a lower dose of CAR-T. While they did experience signs of neurotoxicity, it was milder than the neurotoxicity in the three who received the higher dose.
Participants in both trials did experience at least some side effects of CAR-T therapy, which included fever and vomiting as well as neurological effects such as aphasia.
The two trials come just a week after the results of another CAR-T therapy clinical trial for glioblastoma were published in Nature Medicine. That trial used a single target, IL-13Rα2 — also used in the Penn Medicine trial — in 65 patients and also determined that CAR-T therapy is safe and could be an effective treatment for glioblastoma.
Lam, of Johns Hopkins, said that CAR-T has shown promise in glioblastoma in studies over the past five years. The biggest takeaway the two newest trials bring to the table, he said, is that CAR-T therapy appears to be able to safely target two proteins commonly found in glioblastoma tumors.
The question now is whether the results are durable. The results of the early trials don’t necessarily mean the therapy will work long term.
Both teams plan to continue with their ongoing phase 1 trials and modify their approach to home in on the best combination of treatments for glioblastoma.
Maus said she believes CAR-T therapy may be more effective if a tumor is first weakened by radiation and chemotherapy. Other researchers are also exploring cancer-fighting vaccines, which may be able to be used in tandem with CAR-T therapy.
“We’re learning from each other. I think that’s really a tremendous model, and what we are all seeing is that this sort of therapy has legs for brain tumor patients,” Maus said. “It may not be the final version yet, but we’re onto something.”

2024-03-06T20:31:30.926Z,Patients struggle to get lifesaving medication after cyberattack on a major health care company,NBC News,"Desperate patients around the country have been forced to choose between paying out of pocket for essential medications or forgoing them entirely as the aftermath of a cyberattack on a major health care company stretches into its third week.
Change Healthcare, a little-known but critical subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, detected the attack on Feb. 21. Since then, pharmacies, doctors offices and patients say their lives and work have been upended by widespread outages in systems commonly used for medical billing and insurance claims.
Disruptions to copay assistance and coupon card processing at pharmacies, in particular, have highlighted key vulnerabilities in a system on which people’s lives depend.
Ronda Miller, 54, said she and her husband rely on a discount card to afford his insulin — he has Type 2 diabetes and congestive heart failure. But when she tried to pick up his medication at her pharmacy in Deadwood, South Dakota, on Feb. 22, the card could not be processed. Without it, the medications would cost hundreds of dollars.
“When you are diabetic, whether it’s Type 1 or Type 2, without insulin they’re going to die,” Miller said.
Change Healthcare’s technology is involved in transactions throughout the industry — beyond those involving United Healthcare insurance. The company says it completes 15 billion transactions a year, amounting to $1.5 trillion in health claims. On its website, Change said the hack affected 21 parts of its business, including many that providers use to receive payments, get reimbursed by insurers and process patients’ insurance eligibility.
“Anything that requires interaction between health plans, a pharmacy, a facility, an office has been disrupted,” said Dr. Jesse Ehrenfeld, the president of the American Medical Association. “That has far-reaching implications, whether you’re on routine, standard medications, whether you rely on a rebate program from a pharmaceutical company, whether you’re just trying to get clearance to have routine elective surgery.”
UnitedHealth Group said in a statement that it took “immediate action to disconnect Change Healthcare’s systems to prevent further impact” and that the services would “remain offline until we are certain we can turn them back on safely.”
The company said Tuesday that a new network connecting pharmacies to benefit managers could come online as soon as Thursday.
Laura Lester, who owns Marion Family Pharmacy in Marion, Virginia, said the biggest effect in her community has been on patients who can’t afford their medications without copay assistance cards.
“We’ve got people walking away from diabetes medicines, antipsychotics, ADHD medications,” she said.
“We had one woman yesterday who had to pay $1,100 out of pocket because the copay card wasn’t working,” she added. The patient needed the medication for her irritable bowel syndrome, she said.
Even patients who don’t use copay assistance have faced immense challenges. Donna Hamlet, 73, a breast cancer patient at Florida Cancer Specialists & Research Institute, takes a medication called IBRANCE that would cost her around $16,000 a month without insurance. But on Feb. 23, she said, a pharmacy told her it couldn’t process her refill through insurance because of the cyberattack.
Without the drug, Hamlet said, “the cancer would fill up my body, and I guess I would die.”
After four or five days of phone calls, she got her prescription filled via OptumRx, a UnitedHealth Group pharmacy benefit manager.
Nathan Walcker, the CEO of the Florida institute treating Hamlet, estimates that $350 million worth of the practice’s charges have been affected by billing delays due to the cyberattack.
But Walcker said he worries most about patients who can’t get prior authorizations processed — many insurance companies require them for cancer treatments, which can cost up to $100,000 per course.
“We have no ability today to even know if we have a prior authorization in hand for a new patient,” he said.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on Tuesday encouraged Medicare and Medicaid programs to remove or relax prior authorizations during the outage and to consider giving health care providers advance funding. Hospitals can submit accelerated payment requests, CMS said, and Medicare providers struggling to submit claims can send paper versions and may be eligible for exceptions or extensions.
UnitedHealth Group said that as of Tuesday, around 90% of claims were “flowing uninterrupted,” with pharmacy claims “flowing at near-normal levels,” thanks to temporary fixes or systems’ coming back online.
The company has encouraged health care providers to switch to an Optum system to expedite submitting claims and receiving payments. Meanwhile, the new network connection that the company expects Thursday should address “the majority of the coupon volume” managed by Change Healthcare, it said.
Optum is also offering temporary loans to medical practices, but providers say they’re insufficient.
Dr. Christine Meyer, who owns an internal medicine practice in Exton, Pennsylvania, said her office submits up to $600,000 a month in claims but was offered only a monthly loan of $4,000.
Amid the sudden halt in revenue, Meyer said, the small offer was “an emotional slap in the face.”
Her practice is manually submitting some claims to insurance websites, she said, and her staff printed around 1,000 paper claims and FedExed them to Medicare.
“The next thing I have to do is start to cut expenses, stop buying supplies and vaccines, then reduce our staff, then reduce our hours and then, God forbid, the unthinkable: just shut our doors,” Meyer said.
Doctors, pharmacists and industry experts say the hack has exposed major vulnerabilities in the health sector, particularly given Change Healthcare’s dominance.
“How do you have a system where it has this big of a leak and almost two weeks later, you’re leaving the small pharmacy owners to try to figure out a solution?” asked Dr. Mayank Amin, the owner of Skippack Pharmacy in Skippack, Pennsylvania.
Amin said he and his staff have spent hours calling insurance companies to find out patients’ eligibility manually, one at a time. The work has kept him up until 2 a.m every night, he said. He even plans to pick up free samples of a blood-thinner medication from a local doctor’s office to distribute to a patient.
“What do I get out of this? Zero profit but the feeling that you’re able to help somebody who relies on you,” he said.
Ronda Miller said that her pharmacy in South Dakota gave her husband a free box of his diabetes medication for now and that his doctor also provided a sample. But for families like hers, she said, the disruption has meant “playing with people’s lives.”
Change Healthcare said the perpetrator of the cyberattack “represented itself to us as ALPHV/Blackcat.” Alphv was involved in the attack on MGM Resorts last year, costing the company $100 million. It is developed and maintained by a group of Russian-speaking cybercriminals.
In total last year, victims of cybercrime sent a record $1 billion in extortion payments to ransomware criminals, according to Chainalysis, a company that tracks cryptocurrency payments.
UnitedHealthcare didn’t answer questions about whether it paid a ransom. But experts at the cybersecurity company Recorded Future and the cryptocurrency analytics company Tenable pointed to a bitcoin wallet that received a payment of more than $22 million Friday. The companies say the wallet, which was viewed by NBC News, belonged to Alphv. Wired first reported the news.
The sum has since been doled out, mostly in $3.2 million portions that the two companies haven’t been able to trace fully. Alphv’s site on the dark web claims it is no longer operational.
Cybersecurity expert Eric Noonan, the CEO of CyberSheath, said that if UnitedHealth did pay a ransom, “it’s a terrible precedent, because what it now does is say this is a viable market.”
Change Healthcare was “a very attractive target,” Noonan said, because it runs critical infrastructure and the attack has had visible consequences.
Noonan said UnitedHealth needs to address whether patients’ personal information has been compromised. Thus far, the company has said only that its teams are “actively engaged and working to understand the impact.”
Noonan also called for the federal government to require mandatory minimum cybersecurity for all critical infrastructure sectors, including health care.
“Americans, I think, are somewhat defenseless in this regard, because they’re relying on the companies to implement the right levels of cybersecurity, and that’s largely not happening,” he said.

2024-02-06T22:07:24.109Z,‘I’m fed up’: Frustrations grow as ADHD drug shortage continues,NBC News,"More than a year after the Food and Drug Administration announced a nationwide shortage of Adderall, doctors and patients say they are still struggling to get their hands on ADHD medications. Despite repeated promises from drugmakers that the supply crunches would be resolved soon, shortages persist, and frustration is growing.
Wendy Steele, 48, of Baltimore, says that for the past year, she has had a hard time finding pharmacies that stock medications for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder prescribed for both her and her 9-year-old son, Colton.
Steele takes a generic version of Adderall. Colton is on a generic version of Concerta, which has the same active ingredient as Ritalin. At times, both have had to skip, delay or go without their medications for several weeks. Steele said she believes the shortage is now affecting Colton’s schoolwork.
“I’m fed up with it,” Steele said. “It’s annoying for me, but it is a really critical medication for my son. And that’s what makes me sad. His education is suffering.”
More than 6 million children in the U.S. have been diagnosed with ADHD, one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Millions of adults have it as well, although some may not know it. People with ADHD can seem restless, may have trouble concentrating and may act impulsive. Adderall and other ADHD medications help people with the disorder concentrate and focus, while reducing impulsive behavior.
High demand for the drugs, coupled with drugmakers' claim that they're being restricted in how much they can make, has fueled a nationwide shortage, experts say.
In October 2022, the FDA announced a shortage of Adderall.
Since then, doctors say other ADHD medications, such as Focalin, Ritalin and Vyvanse, have become in short supply.
As of 2022, there were 107 U.S. companies involved in manufacturing ADHD drugs, according to the market research company IBISWorld.
Drugmakers have published estimates of when the medications will be back in stock, but as they struggle with demand, those estimates have been pushed back.
Aurobindo Pharma, which makes a generic version of Adderall, for example, estimated in June that some doses of the drug would be available in December, only for the timeline to be pushed back several months, to September, according to the FDA drug shortage database. Teva Pharmaceuticals, a major manufacturer of ADHD medications, did resolve many of its Adderall shortages. However, certain doses estimated to be available in October or December have been pushed back to February or May, according to the database.
Dr. Lenard Adler, director of the adult ADHD program at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York, said about 30% to 40% of the prescriptions he writes for ADHD medications have to be rewritten because pharmacies may not have them in stock. Prescriptions can’t be transferred between pharmacies, meaning doctors have to issue patients new ones.
“I have several patients who have been off their meds for two to three months,” he said. “When they get off their medications, their symptoms come back and then they forget to make a follow-up appointment, and I have no way of knowing this is happening.”
The shortage has created a huge “burden” for people with the disorder, he added.
“It has been quite difficult,” he said. “It’s sometimes hard to find an alternative medicine. It may require switching preparations or switching doses.” However, the alternative may not be a generic, he added, meaning it will likely cost the patient more money.
Drugmakers and the Drug Enforcement Administration, which regulates controlled substances, are pointing fingers at one another for the problem, said Erin Fox, senior pharmacy director at the University of Utah Health.
Makers of ADHD drugs say they don’t have enough ingredients to make the drugs and need permission from the DEA to make more. The DEA is insisting that drugmakers have not met their quota for production and could make more of the drugs if they wanted. Adderall is a controlled substance regulated by DEA, which sets limits on how much of the active ingredient drugmakers are allowed to produce in a given time frame. Drugmakers must get approval from the DEA before they go over their quotas.
In August, the DEA and FDA issued a joint statement calling on drugmakers that do not wish to increase production to relinquish their allotment so that other drugmakers may produce more of the ADHD medications. The FDA said it was also taking steps to provide alternative treatment options.
In a bid to boost the availability of the medications, in August the FDA approved several generic versions of Vyvanse.
NBC News reached out to five of the major ADHD drug manufacturers for updates on their supplies. They didn’t respond. In addition, the DEA did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
There doesn’t appear too much else the FDA can do in the near term, experts say. In a statement, Chanapa Tantibanchachai, a spokesperson for the FDA, said the agency is working with ""numerous manufacturers"" and others in the supply chain to ""understand, mitigate and prevent"" shortages.
""The FDA recognizes the potential impact that lack of availability of certain products may have on health care providers and patients,"" she said.
Certain formulations of Adderall are also now more widely available, according to the FDA’s drug shortage database, however, the agency still lists the drug as being in shortage.
Dr. Sarah Cheyette, a pediatric neurologist who treats both children and adults with ADHD at the Palo Alto Medical Foundation, said January was a bad month for her patients.
Vyvanse, even with generic versions recently approved, is still hard to come by, she said; so is Ritalin and Focalin.
Patients have to go to multiple pharmacies to find their prescriptions, she said, and many pharmacies tell them they have the drugs on back order.
Dr. David Goodman, director of the Adult Attention Deficit Disorder Center of Maryland, said that for his patients, the shortage is not as “problematic” as it was several months ago, but it's not alleviated yet.
He said he has noticed that the brand name version of Adderall is more readily available, but not its generic versions.
The reason for that, he said, could be because many insurance companies exclusively cover generic versions, prompting patients to quickly get these versions as soon as they hit the market, leading to increased demand and short supply. Some insurance companies, he said, have recently started paying for the brand-name drug if patients are unable to get their hands on the generic versions.
Still, many patients are “frustrated,” he said, adding that some have to wait two to four weeks before they’re able to get their prescription filled, up from a typical wait time of three to four days.
“You have to consider that ADHD individuals have a low frustration tolerance, which is even lower when they are not on their medication,” said Goodman, also an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral Sciences at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. “Their ability to manage the situation and stick with it grows very thin.”
Steele, of Baltimore, said that in recent months, she began calling pharmacies about a week before her son’s prescription runs out to make sure they have it in stock. Because ADHD medications are controlled substances, patients can get a prescription filled for only 30 days at a time.
It’s been an “awful” experience, she said, saying it still sometimes takes weeks to get a prescription filled.
“When is this going to end?”

2024-02-27T23:37:45.799Z,Eye ointments sold at CVS and Walmart recalled due to concerns over sterility,NBC News,"Four eye ointment products sold in some Walmart and CVS stores have been recalled because the facility in which they were manufactured in India may have been unsanitary.
In a recall announcement posted Monday on the Food and Drug Administration website, Brassica Pharma Pvt. Ltd., a product development and manufacturing company in the Indian state of Maharashtra, said an FDA inspection had noted a “lack of sterility assurance at the facility.”
The affected products include two ointments sold under the Equate brand name — Lubricant Eye Ointment and Stye Lubricant Eye Ointment — as well as CVS Health Lubricant Eye Ointment and AACE Pharmaceuticals Lubricant PM Ointment.
“For those patients who use these products, there is a potential risk of eye infections or related harm. These products are intended to be sterile,” the announcement said. “Ophthalmic drug products pose a potential heightened risk of harm to users because drugs applied to the eyes bypass some of the body’s natural defenses.”
The announcement did not specify which types of infections users may be at risk of contracting, nor did it give details about the particular issues at the manufacturing facility. Brassica Pharma did not respond to requests for further information or comment.
The recalled products are intended to relieve eye dryness or discomfort due to itching, burning, stinging or exposure to wind or sun.
Brassica Pharma had not received any reports of infection or other injuries related to the recalled ointments as of Feb. 16, according to the recall announcement. But the company said that consumers should stop using the recalled products and that they can return them to the stores where they were purchased.
The recalled products have expiration dates between February 2024 and September 2025, according to the announcement, and are sold in 3.5-gram tubes that come packaged in cardboard boxes.
The recall came after a string of high-profile incidents in which users contracted serious eye infections from contaminated eyedrops. By May, 81 people had been diagnosed with drug-resistant bacterial infections after having used contaminated eyedrops. Among those cases, 14 people were blinded, four others had to have their eyeballs surgically removed, and four people died. Many affected patients had used drops from the brands EzriCare and Delsam Pharma; those products were recalled.
In August, the FDA told consumers not to use two other types of eyedrops because of a risk of fungal and bacterial contamination. Then the agency issued a warning in November about 28 other eyedrop products sold by Target, Rite Aid, CVS and other retailers. Several of the listed items, some from the brands Leader, Rugby Laboratories and Kilitch Healthcare India Limited, have since been recalled.
If you experience problems after using any of the newly recalled eye ointments, contact your health care provider, Brassica Pharma’s announcement says. People can also submit reports about problems caused by the ointments to the FDA’s adverse event reporting program.

2024-02-19T19:01:40.000Z,Women see greater health benefits from regular exercise than men do,NBC News,"Women generally exercise less than men do, but new research suggests they see greater health benefits from it.
A national study found that women who exercised regularly — at least 2½ hours of moderate exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise per week — had a 24% lower risk of dying over the study period compared with women who didn’t exercise. By contrast, men who exercised regularly were 15% less likely to die than men who didn’t exercise.
Men also needed more exercise than women to achieve the same health benefits: Five hours of moderate or vigorous exercise per week reduced their risk of dying by 18% compared with men who didn’t exercise. But just 140 minutes of weekly exercise had the same effect among women.
“Women got the same benefit at lower levels of physical activity,” said a co-author of the study, Dr. Martha Gulati, the director of preventive cardiology at Cedars-Sinai’s Smidt Heart Institute in Los Angeles.
Women who exercised regularly also had a 36% lower risk of dying from a cardiovascular issue such as a heart attack or stroke, the study found, whereas men who exercised regularly had a 14% lower risk.
The findings were published Monday in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. The researchers analyzed the self-reported exercise habits of more than 412,000 men and women who participated in the National Health Interview Survey from 1997 to 2017.
Roughly one-third of the women regularly engaged in aerobic exercises — ones that elevate the heart rate, such as brisk walking, jumping rope or taking spin classes — compared with 43% of men in the study. Women were also less likely than men to do muscle-strengthening activities, such as lifting weights.
Nevertheless, regular muscle strengthening — roughly one session per week, on average — was associated with a 30% lower risk of women dying from cardiovascular problems and a 19% lower risk of dying overall. Among men, the same weekly exercises lowered the risk of dying from cardiovascular problems by 11% and of death by the same percentage.
Gulati said one major limitation of the study is that it didn't account for how active women were outside workout settings.
“Missing from our data are the things that we do every day — the other physical activity that’s not going to the gym but running after kids, doing gardening, doing household chores,” she said.
The Department of Health and Human Services recommends that adults get 150 minutes of moderate physical activity per week, including two days of muscle-strengthening activities.
But Gulati said those guidelines “can be very overwhelming to someone who does zero.” Many of her female patients struggle to find time for exercise, she said.
“Women are busy. Women work. Women usually take the bulk of family responsibilities — whether that’s children, whether that’s elderly parents — and by the time the day finishes, there’s very little time,” Gulati said.
Data from the National Health Interview Survey suggests that women in 2022 were more likely than men to have been advised over the past year by doctors or other health professionals to increase their amounts of physical activity.
""Rather than talking about 150 minutes a week, the way that we should be saying it is: What can you fit in?"" Gulati said.
Paul Arciero, a professor of sports, medicine and nutrition at the University of Pittsburgh, said it’s only logical to have separate exercise guidelines for men and women.
“There are clear, sex-based differences in response to exercise,” he said. “We have to move beyond thinking that men and women respond similarly.""
Many studies have shown that exercise doesn't affect men and women in the same way.
Arciero’s research in 2022 found that women had greater reductions in blood pressure when they exercised in the morning, whereas men had greater reductions at night. A 2020 review also found that women’s muscles are more resistant to fatigue from high-intensity exercise.
But scientists have been less certain about how those differences affect people’s long-term health.
The new study shows that “women are basically more efficient in responding to exercise, particularly when it comes to heart health and mortality,” said Arciero, who wasn’t involved in the paper.
Arciero said physiological differences may contribute to the advantage: Women have more capillaries (tiny blood vessels) in a given section of muscle than men do, which could allow more blood and oxygen to flow to the heart during exercise.
Women also have higher levels of the hormone estrogen, which enhances blood flow, said Lynda Ransdell, the chair of the kinesiology department at Boise State University.
Ransdell pointed to a third factor as well: Women tend to be less physically active, so it may take less effort to improve their health relative to their baselines.
“I would call it the principle of diminishing returns,” Ransdell said. “Since women typically start at lower levels of fitness, they can see significant gains with taking up a little less physical activity.”
But scientists have more to learn, she added.
“While I love this study and I think it’s groundbreaking and landmark, I also believe that it’s one piece of a puzzle,” Ransdell said. ""I would love to see them do more research with objective measures of physical activity like pedometers or Apple watches.”

2024-01-19T20:41:13.784Z,"In a break with CDC, California quietly changed its Covid isolation guidelines",NBC News,"In California, a person who tests positive for Covid and has no symptoms does not need to isolate, according to new state health guidelines. People who test positive and have mild symptoms, meanwhile, can end isolation once their symptoms improve and they’ve been fever-free for 24 hours without medication — even if that point arrives in less than five days.
The California Department of Public Health updated the policies earlier this month.
""We are now at a different point in time with reduced impacts from COVID-19 compared to prior years due to broad immunity from vaccination and/or natural infection, and readily available treatments available for infected people,"" the department said in a news release.
""Our policies and priorities for intervention are now focused on protecting those most at risk for serious illness, while reducing social disruption that is disproportionate to recommendations for prevention of other endemic respiratory viral infections,"" it added.
The state's guidance differs from that of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which continues to advise people with Covid to stay home for at least five days, regardless of whether they have symptoms.
If symptoms haven’t improved after five days, people should keep isolating until they feel better and have been fever-free for 24 hours, according to the CDC. Many state health departments direct residents to follow the CDC or base their recommendations on the agency's, which have not changed since August 2022.
California isn’t the first state to deviate from the CDC. Since May, the Oregon Health Authority has similarly said that people with Covid don’t need to isolate for a set number of days, but should stay home if they have a fever and avoid contact with high-risk people for 10 days.
California’s policy still asks everyone to wear masks indoors around others for 10 days after their first day of symptoms or positive test, as do Oregon's guidelines.
Several public health experts said the policies balance what scientists know about Covid transmission with people’s growing fatigue of Covid safety measures.
""We have to develop effective, safe ways to live with Covid-19 but not let Covid-19 hijack our life or work anymore,"" said Chunhuei Chi, a professor of health management and policy at Oregon State University.
""What California and Oregon are doing is not just based on evidence, but they have to consider practicality. What is feasible?"" he added.
Even before the policy change, many people in California weren’t testing for Covid — or, if they did test positive, were returning to school or work once they felt better, said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease expert at the University of California, San Francisco.
""A lot of people are not diagnosing the sniffles anymore,"" he said.
Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security, said California’s new recommendations are not surprising.
""Over time, it’s always been kind of assumed that Covid-19 guidance would collapse into the same type of guidance that we use for other respiratory viruses like influenza,"" he said.
But some other public health experts worry that California’s policy could increase Covid transmission.
Saskia Popescu, an assistant professor of epidemiology and public health at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, said the change ""almost feels like an overcorrection"" to California’s historically conservative approach to the virus.
The message that ""if you don’t have symptoms, you’re not really risky to those around you,"" she said, is ""not only counter to what the science says, but it’s also very dismissive of the fact that this person does have an infectious disease.""
Asymptomatic people can spread Covid, but scientists think the risk might be lower than those with symptoms. Chi said it’s hard to know how infectious asymptomatic people are, since research on the subject has declined since 2022.
Built-up immunity from vaccines and infections might also limit people’s ability to transmit Covid, regardless of symptoms, according to Adalja.
""Right now, even people who are symptomatic might test negative because there’s so much immunity that’s keeping the viral load below a contagious level,"" he said.
Still, a positive rapid test is usually a good indicator that you can spread the virus, he added.
Given that some past research has shown people can transmit Covid before and after they have symptoms, Popescu said it doesn’t make sense to lump Covid isolation guidelines with those for other respiratory viruses.
""We really just don’t see asymptomatic cases of influenza and RSV. If you’ve got it, you know it. You feel like you got hit by a bus. Covid is different in that regard,"" Popescu said.
Other states may follow California and Oregon’s example.
Jonathan Modie, the lead communications officer for the Oregon Health Authority, said state health officials have discussed its isolation policy in calls with representatives from six other states and the CDC. In addition, California reached out ""as they began contemplating a change in their guidance, and we met with them separately,"" he said.
Thus far, Oregon’s policy has not led to a disproportionate increase in transmission or severe disease, Modie added.
He said that telling people to isolate ""was doing almost nothing to halt transmission,"" and that ""isolation was placing a significant burden on the workforce and schoolchildren.""
Some public health experts think the CDC might revise its recommendations eventually, while others expect no change.
""While Covid-19 remains a concern we are seeing fewer hospitalizations and Covid-related deaths as compared to last year — likely a result of widespread vaccination and prior infection,"" a CDC spokesperson said in an email. ""CDC will continue to evaluate the latest data as it considers its recommendations.""

2024-02-01T18:03:04.931Z,CDC warns that Neptune's Fix — 'gas station heroin' — may contain synthetic pot,NBC News,"The highly addictive and dangerous supplement Neptune’s Fix — also known as gas station heroin — may be contaminated with different types of synthetic pot, chemicals that have been linked to life-threatening effects such as seizures, brain swelling and hallucinations, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Thursday.
The CDC’s findings were based on a 2023 investigation of 17 adults in New Jersey who had severe reactions after consuming Neptune’s Fix or other products that contain tianeptine. Of them, 13 were hospitalized in intensive care.
Tianeptine, an antidepressant that can mimic the euphoric and sedative effects of opioids, is sold as a dietary supplement at gas stations and convenience stores across the United States. It’s often marketed for pain relief, depression or anxiety. It’s approved in some European, Asian and Latin American countries, but not in the U.S.
The Food and Drug Administration doesn’t approve dietary supplements, which means they aren’t reviewed for safety or effectiveness. In January, House lawmakers called on FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf to crack down on the use of tianeptine.
Doctors in New Jersey — which says it is currently seeing a dramatic increase in reports of poisonings in adults who have consumed tianeptine — tested six samples of Neptune’s Fix consumed by two of the patients. In addition to tianeptine, the products also contained kavain, a substance used for anxiety, as well as two different types of synthetic pot.
“It was a surprise to find those compounds in there at all,” said the study’s senior author Dr. Diane Calello, the medical director of the New Jersey Poison Control Center. “That’s probably not what the people who bought those products were looking for.”
She said it is not yet clear whether all 17 patients, who ranged in age from 28 to 69, were exposed to the synthetic pot, which can often cause unpredictable but severe side effects, including seizures and coma.
Multiple patients experienced high blood pressure and seizures, as well as irregular or rapid heartbeats, and at least one patient had a heart attack, according to the CDC report. Among the 13 admitted to the ICU, seven had to be intubated, according to the report. No deaths were reported.
Dr. Pieter Cohen, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School who studies the regulation of supplements, called the reported symptoms “dramatic and alarming.”
“Usually we might see something like this in 1 in 100 poisonings,” he said. “That’s potentially an incredibly potent mixture of drugs.”
On Jan. 24, the FDA warned that the products had been linked to serious side effects including seizures, loss of consciousness and death. The FDA alert didn’t mention synthetic pot, although  tianeptine can also cause serious side effects, including rapid heart rate, vomiting, agitation, confusion and hallucinations. The FDA first warned consumers not to buy or use Neptune’s Fix in November, noting that the vials could contain other harmful ingredients.
In January, Neptune Resources, the maker of Neptune’s Fix, agreed to voluntarily recall its products, which include Neptune’s Fix Elixir, Neptune’s Fix Extra Strength Elixir and Neptune’s Fix Tablets.
Dr. William Rushton, a medical toxicologist and director of the Alabama Poison Information Center, said he and his colleagues began sounding the alarm about Neptune’s Fix in his state in 2019. Some patients were admitted to ICUs with symptoms of withdrawal.
The problem is now growing, he added, with more reports of people consuming the product in the Northeast.
Cohen said that there needs to be more regulations around supplements in the U.S., noting that the FDA’s current power is “very limited.”
“Consumers remain at risk when they consume dietary supplements here in the United States,” he said.

2024-01-28T12:00:41.000Z,Why one particular diet is found to be the best year after year,NBC News,"Over years of research and diet rankings, one regimen has consistently been found to bring a host of health benefits, and it hasn’t fallen out of favor amid changing fads.
The Mediterranean diet once again topped the list in U.S. News & World Reports’ annual ranking for 2024 — for the seventh consecutive time — earning it a renewed wave of media attention.
The eating regimen is plant-based and emphasizes multiple servings of fruits and vegetables daily, alongside whole grains, legumes, nuts, olive oil and seafood.
Red meats are eaten only occasionally, and dairy and poultry are consumed in moderation, as well. Highly processed foods or those with added sugars are generally avoided.
Researchers and dietitians say following the diet long term can increase the odds of living a longer, healthier life. A wealth of studies suggest it lowers risk of heart disease and Type 2 diabetes, while potentially slowing cognitive decline.
“It’s a way of life, it’s a cuisine, it dates back thousands of years, and in the last five to six decades, it is the most highly researched cuisine in the world,” said Catherine Itsiopoulos, a professor of nutrition and dietetics at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia, who has published several books on the Mediterranean diet.
Here’s what sets the Mediterranean diet apart.
The bulk of evidence centers on the Mediterranean diet’s link to a lower risk of cardiovascular disease and related conditions like obesity, high cholesterol and hypertension.
According to a 2021 review of research, the diet has been shown to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease in women by 29% and stroke by 13%. A 2017 analysis, meanwhile, found that it can lower the risk of coronary heart disease, heart attacks and strokes by 40%, on average.
That may be because the fats in olive oil, seeds, fish and nuts are the healthy kind: monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fats. By contrast, red meat, cheese, dairy and highly processed foods like cookies or chips are packed with unhealthy fats that can clog arteries with plaque.
Those fatty foods can also cause chronic, low-grade inflammation, which occurs when certain types of immune system cells remain present too long, according to Dr. Selvi Rajagopal, an assistant professor of medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Those active cells can attack and damage organs and healthy tissue.
“This is affecting how people’s bodies create cholesterol and how they are able to regulate blood sugar and form plaque,” Rajagopal said.
Some studies have suggested the Mediterranean diet helps combat chronic inflammation because of its emphasis on fruits, vegetables and legumes, which contain antioxidants and other beneficial compounds.
Regular use of extra virgin olive oil may also help reduce inflammation and lower blood pressure, according to a review of research published in June. But it’s not enough on its own.
“If someone is having McDonald’s and drinking a lot of soft drinks, but they’re using olive oils, I don’t think you’re going to get the same benefit as someone who’s really embraced the overall diet,” said Kelly LeBlanc, a registered dietitian and vice president of nutrition programming at Oldways, a nonprofit organization that promotes sustainable eating. “There isn’t one singular dietary magic bullet or villain.”
Research has long linked excessive consumption of sugar to a risk of Type 2 diabetes. Because the Mediterranean diet relies on honey and cinnamon as sweeteners, and the primary source of sugar is fruit, it’s associated with a decreased risk of the disease.
An April study, which compared blood samples from more than 300,000 participants, found that those who adhered to the Mediterranean diet had a nearly 30% lower risk of Type 2 diabetes.
The effect may also be influenced by the consumption of plant-based fats from nuts, olive oil and avocados, which can improve insulin sensitivity.
The fibrous staples in the Mediterranean diet, like beans, lentils, apples and brown rice, are also associated with more regular bowel movements and lower blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar levels, according to the Food and Drug Administration.
These foods affect the health of the gut microbiome — the ecosystem of bacteria in our digestive systems that aids in breaking down food and extracting nutrients. The microbiome also helps defend the body against pathogens.
“Good bacteria in our gut feed off of that good fiber, and that allows them to proliferate,” Rajagopal said.
This creates a strong lining in the intestines, she added: “The more of that we have, it’s like a protection. It’s like a separate army against disease.”
Adhering to the Mediterranean diet may also lower the risk of death from cancer, in addition to reducing the chances of several particular types — including breast, colorectal, head and neck and lung cancers — according to a 2020 review of research.
Then there are the diet’s benefits for the mind: A March study found that adhering to a Mediterranean diet could reduce risk of dementia among seniors by almost 25%. According to the National Institute on Aging, the diet is associated with fewer signs of Alzheimer’s disease in the brain.
More research is needed to understand that link, but one hypothesis is that the antioxidants in fruits and vegetables can prevent damage to brain cells, according to a 2019 study.
Despite the Mediterranean diet’s myriad benefits, there’s a drawback: It won’t necessarily help you shed pounds quickly, since foods like olive oil and nuts are high in fat and calories. Losing weight on the diet requires regular physical activity and being careful about portion sizes.
“If you’re 50 pounds overweight, the Mediterranean diet alone won’t take off all those extra pounds,” said Dr. Walter Willett, a professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
That having been said, the diet's variety can make it more enjoyable to stick with than restrictive weight-loss regimens, Willett added.
Plus, he said, when the Mediterranean is paired with regular exercise, any weight loss is more likely to be maintained.

2024-01-22T21:00:50.168Z,Owner of failed nursing home chain accused of $38 million tax fraud scheme pleads guilty,NBC News,"The former owner of a collapsed national nursing home chain who ran more than 100 facilities out of a tiny office above a New Jersey pizzeria has pleaded guilty in federal court in connection with what prosecutors called a $38 million payroll tax fraud scheme.
Joseph Schwartz, whose Skyline Healthcare nursing home chain was the subject of an NBC News investigation, pleaded guilty to failing to pay the IRS employment taxes withheld from his employees and failing to file annual financial reports with the federal Labor Department.
If the court accepts his plea agreement, he will be sentenced to a year in prison and three years’ supervised release, with a requirement to pay $5 million in restitution. A sentencing hearing is scheduled for May.
“Joseph Schwartz admitted to defrauding the United States by failing to pay the IRS more than $38 million in payroll taxes,” New Jersey U.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger said. “Schwartz broke the law when he willfully withheld trust fund taxes from his employees but pocketed the money he had withheld rather than turning it over to the government; he will now be held accountable for his criminal tax violations.”
Kevin Marino, Schwartz’s attorney, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Court documents show that Schwartz operated Skyline Healthcare using an intricate web of more than 190 limited liability companies, or LLCs, nationwide that oversaw facilities across 11 states.
The rapid rise and fall of the Skyline chain from 2017 to 2019 resulted in more than a dozen Skyline-operated nursing homes’ shutting down, throwing residents, vendors, employees and state regulators into chaos.
The chain was also the subject of documented reports of abuse and neglect by state and local authorities that captured headlines.
The state of Arkansas issued Skyline facilities more than $200,000 in civil fines for neglect, preventable falls, failure to bathe residents and the presence of maggots in a resident’s personal medical equipment.
In September 2017, Skyline had taken over Ashton Place, a nursing home in Memphis, Tennessee. Less than two months later, a resident found lying in feces was taken to a hospital, where nurses discovered maggots and gangrene in his leg, according to a police report obtained by NBC affiliate WMC.
The neglect case led to a state investigation that resulted in federal regulators’ shutting down three Skyline nursing homes in Tennessee.
Even after Skyline’s collapse, problems continued to plague nursing homes linked to Schwartz.
In the first few weeks of the Covid pandemic, a New Jersey facility that was run by Louis Schwartz, a former Skyline executive, was found to have 15 bodies stuffed into a four-person morgue and 83 resident deaths from Covid. After an investigation, the state sought to take over the facility, but before plans were finalized the federal government terminated funding for the nursing home in August 2022, and residents were relocated to new skilled nursing homes. Louis Schwartz is Joseph Schwartz's son. Both men have denied allegations of abuse and neglect.
Skyline’s collapse has often been cited as an example of why the federal government should scrutinize rapid changes in nursing home ownership. In September, the White House announced that new nursing home owners would be required to provide fingerprints for background checks and disclose more information about their ownership structures and their investors.
Schwartz still faces felony Medicaid and tax charges in Arkansas related to eight nursing homes he owned in the state.
Schwartz received tens of millions of dollars in gross income from his Arkansas facilities in 2018 and 2019 but failed to file an Arkansas tax return as required by law, according to documents filed by the state attorney general.
He has pleaded not guilty. A hearing is scheduled for May.

2024-03-09T00:04:00.506Z,More than 100 kids have died of flu this year. Many were previously healthy.,NBC News,"More than 100 children have died of the flu this season, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Friday.
The number of pediatric deaths — 103 so far — is not a seasonal record. While kids with underlying health problems are more at risk for severe outcomes from the flu, the latest CDC numbers provide a stark reminder that flu can indeed be devastating to any child.
“This is certainly sobering information, but it’s not something necessarily unexpected,” said Alicia Budd, head of the CDC’s domestic influenza surveillance team.
More than half of the children who died (53%) had no medical issues before their influenza infection, Budd said.
Among the 10 new pediatric deaths in the most recent report, most died within the last few weeks, Budd said.
Although cases seem to be peaking across the country, flu season is not over. The CDC estimates that the nation has logged at least 28 million flu illnesses, resulting in 310,000 hospitalizations so far this year. In addition to the 103 pediatric deaths, about 20,000 others have died of flu.
“There is a popular misconception among families that flu is just another cold virus, and that it’s no big deal,” said Dr. Kristina Bryant, a pediatric infectious disease physician at Norton Healthcare in Louisville, Kentucky.
“I have taken care of kids who are critically ill in the intensive care unit with flu,” Bryant said. “I’ve taken care of kids who have ultimately died from flu. And almost universally, their parents tell me, ‘I had no idea that flu could do this to my child.’”
The vast majority of children infected with flu every year recover. One of the virus’ biggest mysteries is how it can quickly and swiftly kill otherwise healthy and robust children without warning.
Kids have smaller airways, so breathing becomes compromised once a virus infects and inflames those airways, said Dr. Alexandra Yonts, a pediatric infectious diseases physician at Children’s National Hospital in Washington, D.C.
Children’s immune systems are superprimed to attack any new germ that comes their way, said Yonts. Sometimes those immune responses go too far.
As with a lot of viral illnesses, more than anything it’s the body’s immune response that determines the severity of the symptoms.
“There’s something about influenza that is particularly immunogenic to our bodies and can create these massive cytokine storms and fevers that end up landing kids in the ICU with a sepsis-like picture,” Yonts said.
The CDC’s Budd said that nearly 90% of the children who died of flu this year were not fully vaccinated. For most kids, this means just one shot per year. But kids younger than age 8 need two doses if they’ve never received the flu shot before.
Just over 50% of kids got the flu shot this season, slightly lower than 53.3% last year. Preliminary CDC data shows the vaccine is up to 61% effective in keeping kids with flu out of the hospital.
“The vaccine can reduce the risk of a child needing to have a medical visit by about two-thirds,” Budd said. “And it can reduce their risk of hospitalization by about half.”
Experts can’t predict which flu virus strains might be more virulent in any given year. About half of the pediatric deaths in the 2023-24 season were due to an influenza A strain, the CDC reported, while 47 were attributed to an influenza B strain. One child had both A and B strains.
The 2014-15 flu season was a particularly severe one that took the lives of 141 children. Gianna Wehrkamp, a perfectly healthy and energetic 2-year-old, was one of them.
It was Jan. 8, 2015, when Gianna came home from day care with a slight fever — not even 100 degrees. Her mother, Angie Wehrkamp, said Gianna was playing normally and did not act like anything was wrong. “She was just as bossy as always,” she said.
The next morning, the normally smiley, spunky little girl was not herself.
“She just looked like she didn’t feel good,” Wehrkamp, 46, of Sioux Falls, South Dakota, said. “You could see it on her face.”
A trip to the doctor revealed that Gianna had influenza A. The doctor assured Wehrkamp that Gianna would soon be on the mend.
Gianna spent the day resting at home with her beloved teddy bear named “Dog” and watched cartoons; “Mickey Mouse Clubhouse” and “Frozen” were favorites. Gianna perked up a bit at dinner, eating black olives one by one off of the tips of her fingers. Her fever never rose above 101 degrees.
At bedtime, Wehrkamp said that Gianna’s lungs sounded “a little rattly,” so she brought the little girl into her bed to keep an eye on her overnight.
“Around 2 a.m., I woke up and she was not breathing,” Wehrkamp said. It took paramedics nearly an hour to get Gianna’s heart beating again.
By then, it was too late.
Less than 48 hours after she started showing symptoms, Gianna died of influenza.
“It all just happened so fast,” Wehrkamp said. “We did not know that healthy children could lose their lives to the flu.”
The little girl hadn’t received the flu shot the year she died.
“We had every intention of getting Gianna vaccinated,” her mother said. “But it just kind of fell off the radar as busy parents, and unfortunately we paid the ultimate price for that. Failing to make that a priority will forever be my greatest regret.”

2024-02-18T12:00:40.000Z,Measles infections pose far more risks than most realize,NBC News,"Erica Finkelstein-Parker planned her daughter’s 8th birthday party with love.
Because Emmalee adored airplanes, Finkelstein-Parker chose the theme “Flying High with Emmalee.” Finkelstein-Parker filled nearly two dozen brightly colored goody bags for Emmalee’s friends — one for every child in her class, so no one would feel left out.
Months later, the treat bags remained unopened in Finkelstein-Parker’s bedroom, reminders of a birthday party that was never held.
Emmalee, who developed a rare complication of measles that can strike years after infection, spent her 8th birthday in hospice care at her family’s home. Her parents adopted Emmalee from an orphanage in India when she was 2 ½ years old. The orphanage staff didn’t tell them she had been infected with measles.
“There are some things that a parent should never have to do,” said Finkelstein-Parker, of Littlestown, Pennsylvania. “I had to call the birthday venue and explain that we were canceling the party because our daughter was dying.”
Emmalee died on Jan. 2, 2011.
“People think these diseases are ancient history, but they’re still around,” said Finkelstein-Parker. “Measles is a stealth virus. It may look like it has cleared your body, but it can hide in your nervous system.”
The massive resurgence of measles around the world — attributed to pandemic-related declines in immunizations and rising rates of vaccine hesitancy among parents — raises the risk of more serious complications and deaths, said Dr. James Cherry, a professor of pediatrics and an infectious disease expert at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA.
In the past two months, doctors in the U.S. have diagnosed dozens of measles cases related to unvaccinated travelers who arrived at international airports, then exposed others at hospitals and day care centers. State health departments have reported measles cases in California, Georgia, Missouri, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Washington, Ohio, Maryland and Minnesota. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued a warning to health providers, warning them to be on alert for more cases.
“All it takes is one infected traveler to spark an outbreak,” said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. “It’s coming from people who are getting off airplanes.”
Measles is so contagious that even one case is considered an outbreak. Each measles patient infects an average of 12 to 18 people who lack immunity from vaccines or natural infection. In comparison, each Covid-19 patient infects about two other people, said Dr. Paul Offit, the director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.
“Measles is much, much more contagious than Covid or the flu,” Offit said.
Although two doses of the measles vaccine protect 97% of children, the airborne virus spreads so quickly that 95% of children in a community need to be vaccinated in order to stop outbreaks. About 93% of children were up to date on the measles vaccine in 2022-23, according to the CDC.
All states mandate vaccinations for children in public schools, but a growing number of families are taking advantage of exemptions for religious, philosophical or medical reasons. About 3% of students are now exempt from vaccine mandates. In 10 states, more than 5% of schoolchildren are exempt, a rate that makes it harder to contain outbreaks.
People who decline to vaccinate their children against measles are taking large and unnecessary risks, Dr. Peter Hotez, co-director of the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children’s Hospital, said. Measles vaccines have repeatedly been shown to be safe.
For every 10,000 children infected with measles, 2,000 will be hospitalized; 1,000 will develop ear infections with the potential for permanent hearing loss; 500 will develop pneumonia; and 10 to 30 will die, said Hotez, who is also dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine.
Ariel Loop was shocked when her 4-month-old son, who had received all recommended vaccines, became sick with measles after visiting Disneyland in 2015. Babies are vulnerable to measles because they aren’t routinely vaccinated against the virus until age 12 to 15 months.
Loop took her son to the emergency room after he developed red spots, itchy eyes and a fever of 102 degrees that acetaminophen didn’t help. Loop, a nurse, was especially worried about her son because he was born prematurely and suffered a stroke while in utero.
“He was my first baby, and I didn’t know how dangerous measles was,” said Loop, who lives in Pasadena, California.
Measles often leaves patients vulnerable to secondary bacterial infections, such as pneumonia, one of the most common causes of death in measles patients, said Patricia Stinchfield, president of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases.
Measles also causes “immune amnesia,” in which the immune system loses its ability to fight infections that a patient was previously immune to, Cherry said. The virus wipes out 11% to 73% of a person’s antibodies — both those acquired through infection and vaccination — which can leave patients at increased risk from viruses such as the flu and bacteria that cause pneumonia and skin infections.
In addition to the well-known red spots on the skin, measles usually causes white spots in the mouth, which can make it painful for children to eat or drink, Stinchfield said. Many kids with measles become dehydrated and malnourished during their illness.
About 20% of measles patients are hospitalized, often because they need intravenous fluids, she said.
“These kids come in, slung over their parents’ shoulders, barely able to hold the head up,” Stinchfield said. “They’re like little rag dolls. They won’t even take a popsicle.”
In the days before children develop a red measles rash, symptoms include:
Many become so sensitive to light that ordinary room lights hurt their eyes.
“It might look like the common cold except for the degree of misery they have,” Offit said.
People with measles can spread the virus for nine days — from four days before they develop spots until four days after, Stinchfield said.
Because the virus spreads through aerosols, it can infect people up to two hours after a sick person has left the room.
Although Emmalee was always tiny for her size — topping out at a weight of 39 pounds — she was otherwise healthy, Finkelstein-Parker said.
The first signs of serious illness occurred when Emmalee was 7 and began tripping over her feet, Finkelstein-Parker said. At first, her mother said she wondered if Emmalee’s new shoes were too big. The next day, Emmalee’s chin dropped onto her chest, as if she couldn’t hold up her head. While sitting in a chair, Emmalee listed to one side, without enough muscle control to remain upright.
A pediatrician at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia who was trained in India quickly recognized the early signs of a devastating long-term complication of measles called subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, which is more common in countries where the virus remains endemic. The fatal condition can cause memory loss, irritability, disturbances in movement, seizures and blindness, and can develop six to eight years after a child has apparently recovered from measles. Although anti-seizure drugs can sometimes ease symptoms, they don’t cure the disease.
Recent research shows the complication is more common than previously believed, striking about 1 in 600 infants with measles.
Emmalee began having uncontrollable seizures. After four months, Emmalee slipped into a coma while at home, Finkelstein-Parker said.
“My father couldn’t understand why she wouldn’t wake up,” Finkelstein-Parker said. “He tried everything, including playing music from her favorite music box.”
Emmalee spent five weeks in home hospice, passing away five months after symptoms began, Finkelstein-Parker said.
After Emmalee died, Finkelstein-Parker took the goody bags to school as presents for her daughter’s classmates. The children, who were also grieving, shared their favorite stories about Emmalee, and made a hanging mobile decorated with drawings and notes.
“Their teacher said they needed closure,” Finkelstein-Parker said. “They handled that day a whole lot better than I did.”

2024-02-07T22:35:57.684Z,"As ER overcrowding worsens, a program helping to ease the crisis may lose funding",NBC News,"As emergency room doctors nationwide plead for help to ease patient overcrowding, the one federal program that could fix the crisis is poised to lose funding.
Across the U.S., ER patients who need to be hospitalized find themselves stuck in hallways or waiting rooms, sometimes for days or weeks, before they are able to get further care.
Marissa Long, 30, spent three days and four nights on a gurney in a busy Los Angeles ER hallway last March, separated from other sick patients just a few feet away by a thin fabric curtain.
Long, a heart transplant recipient, was showing signs of possible organ rejection: trouble breathing and falling blood pressure. She needed to be admitted to the hospital, but there were no beds available.
“People were coughing and vomiting,” Long said. “I already have a low immune system. I was scared to get sick.”
Last summer in Bangor, Maine, Michael Day had heard of ER hallways full of sick patients, hacking and sneezing; people left sitting for days on hard, plastic waiting room chairs.
He did not want to go to the emergency room, although the 75-year-old had no choice. Following a diagnosis of advanced esophageal cancer, he was rapidly declining. He was weak and jaundiced. His blood pressure was plummeting.
With no available room in the hospital, Day found himself stuck in the ER, twice.
On one visit, Day developed a bed sore from remaining stationary for more than 26 hours. During another, the ER staff started him on an IV to replenish his fluids and hooked him up to a blood pressure monitor while he waited to be seen by a doctor.
Once again, hours ticked by.
Day’s wife, Kathy — a former ER nurse — said they were there so long that the batteries in her husband’s blood pressure monitor eventually died. His IV ran out and dried up. The staff on duty, Kathy Day said, did not notice.
At that moment, Kathy Day uttered the sentiment echoed by countless ER patients across the country: “This is bulls---.”
Emergency medical care is meant for one of two things: Treat a person quickly and send them home — stitch up a deep cut, perhaps, or determine that a high fever isn’t a life-threatening infection, for example; or get the patient admitted into the hospital for further care.
Because America’s health care system as a whole is woefully understaffed to care for an aging population rife with chronic illnesses, or to meet increasing needs for mental health services, patients show up in the ER and, without any place else to go, stay in the ER.
“There are fewer nursing home beds. There are fewer rehab beds. There are fewer psychiatric beds,” said Dr. Ali Raja, deputy chair of emergency medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. “Our overall length of stay for inpatients has gone up. Since those patients are staying longer in the hospital, we end up having more boarders in the emergency department.”
Ninety-seven percent of ER doctors said they experienced patient boarding times of more than 24 hours, according to a November 2022 survey by the American College of Emergency Physicians.
More than a quarter, 28%, of the ER doctors said patients were forced to stay in the ER for more than two weeks before getting a hospital bed.
“There have been instances where patients are literally waiting for several weeks to months,” Dr. Aisha Terry, president of the American College of Emergency Physicians, said during a briefing in October with reporters. “Patients are leaving early, or dying waiting.”
Rising health care costs have forced health systems nationwide — often in rural areas — to shutter hospitals and other medical facilities in recent decades, according to the American Hospital Association. Elder care centers have also been affected, especially during the pandemic. A report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that the number of workers in nursing homes and other care facilities fell by 410,000 between February 2020 and November 2021.
Dr. Joseph Tennyson, president of the Massachusetts chapter of the American College of Emergency Physicians said he recently worked an ER shift in which he had patients on oxygen support “waiting hours for an ICU bed that didn’t exist.”
Raja said his ER has been operating at a level dubbed “capacity disaster” — with at least 45 patients boarded at a time — for at least a year. On Jan. 11, the Massachusetts General Hospital ER reached an unfathomable level of boarded patients: 103. The situation prompted the hospital to ask its state health department to approve an extra 94 beds to ease the overcrowding.
“We don’t have a clear solution,” Raja said.
On Jan. 15, 229 people across the state were boarded and waiting to get a hospital bed, according to the Massachusetts chapter of the ACEP. For comparison, on Jan 17, 2022, during the Covid omicron surge, 278 people were boarded. Neither of those numbers include patients waiting for space to free up on a psychiatric care floor.
Massachusetts is unique in that it keeps very good statistics on the number of people waiting for hospital beds. Many states do not.
Dr. Doug Jeffrey, president-elect of the Texas College of Emergency Physicians, said the situation — which affects ERs across the country — has “gone from our typical organized chaos to an out-of-control crisis.”
“We’re treating people in the waiting room. We’re treating people in the hallways. It’s unsafe for patients,” Jeffrey said.
Michael Day made several trips to the ER before passing away on Aug. 7. While his cancer was terminal, his wife Kathy, who worked 53 years as a nurse, is convinced that his condition worsened because of the delays in care.
“This is not patient care,” Day said. “It’s more like warehousing.”
ER boarding has reached such a crisis point that some hospitals have begun to invest in a promising solution to ease the overcrowding crisis.
A federal program called “Acute Hospital Care at Home,” or Hospital at Home, is designed to free up hospital beds, allowing patients to recover in their own beds. It was started by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in 2020 to help ease hospital strain during the pandemic.
In the program, people who are sick enough to be hospitalized — but well enough to do basic daily activities, such as walk safely to a bathroom — are able to be cared for in their own home, with round-the-clock remote monitoring and twice-daily visits from medical personnel. The average length of “stay” is four days.
Florence Sparks, 80, of Pineville, North Carolina, jumped at the chance to be treated at home rather than stay any longer in an ER. Sparks was having trouble breathing on Jan. 15 and had already spent 17 hours in an emergency department.
Sparks has congestive heart failure — a condition in which the heart doesn't pump blood effectively — and it was clear that she needed more care than the ER could provide.
Instead of waiting for an in-patient hospital room, her doctors utilized the Hospital at Home program, run by Atrium Health in Charlotte.
A community paramedic checked in on Sparks twice a day, adjusting her IV and her medications as needed — all in collaboration with her doctor.
Atrium Health says it’s managing up to 60 patients a day in North Carolina through its Hospital at Home program, and aims to treat 100 patients daily by the end of 2024. Within the next 18 months, organizers project the program will free up 10% of their in-patient hospital beds.
“If we did not have Hospital at Home, there’s no doubt in my mind, we would have people with longer delays for getting out of emergency departments,” said Matt Anderson, senior medical director, Virtual Health at Atrium. “We know that there’s strain.”
Sparks was able to sleep in her own bed while getting hospital-level care.
“I think they’re more attentive,"" she said. “They’re not rushed to see another patient. They give you their undivided attention.”
Colleen Hole, a registered nurse and head of Atrium Health’s Hospital at Home program, called it “the model for the future” and said it could help reduce costs up to 25%.
“It’s proven to be a model that works for our patients and works for our health system capacity challenges,” she said.
At least 311 hospitals in 37 states have been approved to set up the program, although it’s unclear how many are actually using it, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
CMS funds for the program are set to run out by the end of this year, though Congress could vote to extend it for another two years.
In the meantime, many hospitals have been reluctant to invest resources in it, especially if the funding is uncertain. Hospitals bill CMS directly for Hospital at Home patients on Medicare and Medicaid.
“For many hospitals, it seems like it might not be worth it,” said Nancy Foster, vice president for quality and patient safety policy at the American Hospital Association.
Some private insurers have signed on, but Atrium Health’s Hole said that many of the biggest commercial payers are waiting to see if the federal government continues to fund the program.
While patients languish in ER hallways, waiting for a hospital bed, the federal government has done little else to help.
The Department of Health and Human Services has promised to set up a roundtable within the next six months to “identify actionable next steps and novel opportunities to chart a public-private strategy to address ED crowding and boarding,” HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra wrote in a letter in December to the American College of Physicians.
CMS is scheduled to present national Hospital at Home data to Congress later this year.
“Our hope is that in the final quarter of 2024, we can actually introduce a bill that will become permanent,” Hole said. “I’m anxious because we’re running out of time.”

2024-02-02T18:52:27.861Z,Silicon Valley county becomes first in U.S. to declare loneliness a public health emergency,NBC News,"Loneliness is officially a health emergency in California's San Mateo County, which is located in the San Francisco Bay Area and includes part of Silicon Valley.
The county's Board of Supervisors passed a resolution on Tuesday that declared loneliness a public health crisis and pledged to explore measures that promote social connection in the community.
It’s the first county in the U.S. to make such a declaration.
The resolution doesn’t directly set aside funds for programs to reduce loneliness; rather, it signals the county's commitment to addressing the issue and validates residents' experiences, said David Canepa, the Board of Supervisors’ vice president, who introduced the legislation.
""What we're trying to do is to really get people out of the corners and say, 'Hey, look, there are a lot of people who are feeling like you. You're not alone. And moving forward, here are some of the things that we can do to support you,'"" he said.
Canepa added that the measure was partly inspired by efforts in the U.K. and Japan, which have each appointed national ministers to address loneliness. He was also influenced by conversations with his staff about the links between loneliness and smoking and diabetes, as well as an advisory from Surgeon General Vivek Murthy in May that urged governments to prioritize strategies to promote social connection.
Murthy wrote Friday in a post on X that he was grateful to San Mateo for leading the charge.
Around 17% of U.S. adults in a Gallup poll in February 2023 said they had experienced loneliness the day prior. Canepa said the rate in San Mateo is higher, pointing to a county-led survey in 2022 — the latest data available — which found that 45% of residents were struggling with loneliness and isolation.
An abundance of research has outlined serious health consequences associated with loneliness, including an increased risk of dementia, depression, anxiety, heart disease and stroke.
A November study found that people in the U.K. who lived alone and were not visited by friends or family had a 39% increased risk of premature death compared with people whose loved ones visited daily. An analysis published in 2010, meanwhile, found that social relationships — or lack thereof — had a greater influence on the risk of death than obesity.
Relative to white people, Black people face a higher risk of premature death linked to social isolation. Older adults have a higher risk of loneliness in general, since they are more likely to live alone or have chronic illnesses that limit their mobility or leave them homebound.
Canepa said San Mateo has a large share of older residents, many of whom became especially isolated during the pandemic. People ages 65 and up make up more than 18% of the county's population, compared with the state average of 16%.
“It’s sort of a perfect storm for older adults right now,” said Jennifer Steele, the CEO of Meals on Wheels San Francisco, an organization that delivers hot meals to seniors in northern San Mateo County.
“People don’t live close to their loved ones anymore,"" she said. ""Sometimes people have outlived their loved ones in some cases. Your social circle shrinks after retirement. It’s harder for people to make friends.”
Around 45% of the seniors served by Meals on Wheels in northern San Mateo live alone, according to the organization.
“We’re often the only people that they may see in a week,” Steele said. “It’s a crisis for a lot of the people that we serve.”
Canepa said he also worries about loneliness among teenagers and young adults in San Mateo for two reasons. One is that they’re frequently on social media, and research has shown that heavy social media use can increase feelings of loneliness. Another is that Silicon Valley’s high-achieving atmosphere may put stress on teens.
“You have Stanford, which is in Palo Alto right next to our county line. You have all these educational institutions. People are dealing with, ‘Oh my God, I have to fill out my college recommendation. Oh, my goodness, what school am I going to get accepted to?’ There’s so much pressure on our young people,” he said.
Canepa said he has several ideas for how to improve social connections in San Mateo — among them, investing in infrastructure to make neighborhoods more walkable and partnering with social media platforms headquartered there, like Meta, to encourage residents to get outside or join community meetups. He also wrote a letter to California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Tuesday calling for a state-appointed ""minister of loneliness.""
A county fund subsidized by sales tax could help finance some of these efforts, Canepa said. The fund allocates $47 million annually for new community initiatives, including around $10 million for mental health initiatives. Canepa’s office is seeking proposals from organizations that fit those categories.
But it’s difficult to predict what will actually ease loneliness, said David Sbarra, a psychology professor at the University of Arizona. While scientists have a good understanding of the downstream effects of loneliness, he said, they don’t have a clear picture of all the factors that contribute to it.
Sbarra said treating loneliness as purely a mental health issue can ignore systemic factors that make it hard to socialize. For instance, people who work two jobs have less time to spend with friends or family, he said.
“If local governments increase the minimum wage, you might do more for loneliness than getting people to reappraise difficult events in their life,"" Sbarra said.
Murthy's advisory outlined several strategies to encourage socialization. One is policy measures like accessible public transportation and paid family leave that make it easier for people to spend time with one another. Another is investment in community spaces like parks, libraries and playgrounds. Health care providers could also ask the patients they see if they're feeling lonely.
But Sbarra said there's still a debate as to whether loneliness is an epidemic in the U.S., as Murthy has said. The same Gallup poll last year found that loneliness in adults had declined since 2020 and early 2021. Sbarra said people may start to feel less lonely as they re-adjust to social activities post-pandemic.
Nevertheless, he said, it's important for governments to see socialization as a public health priority.
“Thinking of your relationships as important to your health, as you do physical activity, diet and sleep is really the key messaging here,” he said.

2024-03-01T16:32:09.057Z,Lawsuit accuses Kleenex maker Kimberly-Clark of polluting a town with PFAS chemicals,NBC News,"Kimberly-Clark has been hit with a proposed class action filed by Connecticut residents living near a facility where it makes Kleenex accusing the consumer goods company of contaminating their properties and drinking water with toxic “forever chemicals.”
The lawsuit filed in Connecticut federal court on Wednesday alleges the company has used per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, to make tissues at its plant in New Milford. PFAS are released into the air via smokestacks, and may seep into the ground via paper sludge dumped at a nearby landfill, the lawsuit said.
A spokesperson for Kimberly-Clark said the company believes the lawsuit is “unfounded.” They said Kimberly-Clark does not use PFAS in its U.S. consumer products, and plans to “vigorously” defend itself against the allegations.
PFAS are a group of thousands of related chemicals used in hundreds of consumer and commercial products, including to make water resistant diaper linings, paper products, stain-resistant clothing and cosmetics. PFAS have been linked to cancer and hormonal dysfunction, and are often called forever chemicals because they do not easily break down in nature or the human body.
The residents say PFAS emitted from the facility’s smokestacks attaches to air particles or rain before landing on their property, and that can seep through soil into groundwater. They claim contamination on their properties has led to a drop in property values and increased their risk of disease from drinking polluted water.
They accuse Kimberly-Clark of being negligent, arguing it had a duty to take reasonable care not to expose the residents to toxic chemicals. The company violated that duty because it failed to warn them that PFAS was being used and failed to take steps to stop dangerous PFAS releases, among other things.
The class would include Connecticut residents living near the facility and nearby property owners, and seeks damages for financial losses and punitive damages. It also seeks an order requiring Kimberly-Clark to install water filters and to create a fund to pay to monitor the health of the residents.
Thousands of lawsuits have been filed in recent years against manufacturers of PFAS and the companies that use the chemicals to create a diverse array of products, including lawsuits against other companies that produce paper products in Wisconsin and Maine.
Last year, companies that have manufactured the chemicals including 3M, DuPont de Nemours, Chemours and Corteva agreed to pay a combined over $11 billion to resolve their liability for PFAS contamination in public water systems.
Concerns about the toxicity of PFAS have also spurred federal regulatory action. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency last year proposed the first-ever enforceable drinking water limits for several of the substances.
The EPA is expected to finalize that rule, and another designating two of the chemicals as hazardous substances under the U.S. Superfund law, this year.

2024-02-07T18:15:46.956Z,FDA names likely source of lead in contaminated cinnamon applesauce pouches,NBC News,"The recalled WanaBana cinnamon applesauce pouches potentially linked to lead poisonings in hundreds of people across the United States were likely contaminated by a single cinnamon processor in Ecuador, the Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday.
Ecuadorian officials have identified Carlos Aguilera, a cinnamon processor, as “the likely source of contamination” of the applesauce pouches, the FDA said.
Aguilera sourced his cinnamon from Sri Lanka. According to Ecuadorian officials, the cinnamon sticks were free from lead contamination before they were processed.
Aguilera is just one part of supply chain for the Florida-based WanaBana cinnamon applesauce pouches. The pouches are made at a facility in Ecuador called Austrofoods, which sources its cinnamon from another Ecuadorian supplier called Negasmart. Negasmart, in turn, got its cinnamon from Aguilera, according to Ecuadorian officials.
The investigation and legal proceedings by officials in Ecuador to determine ultimate responsibility for the contamination are still ongoing, the FDA said, but Aguilera's business is not operating at this time.
In an interview with the Ecuadorian newspaper El Universo, Aguilera denied the accusation, saying he did not contaminate the cinnamon. He said that officials sampled products processed in three of his mills and did not find lead.
WanaBana did not immediately respond to a request for comment. NBC News was unable to reach Negasmart.
WanaBana has previously said it is working with the FDA on its investigation.
Since late last year, the FDA has been investigating lead contamination in WanaBana apple cinnamon fruit puree, along with two other products made by WanaBana: the supermarket brands Schnucks apple sauce pouches with cinnamon and Weis cinnamon apple sauce. The FDA had homed in on the cinnamon as the most likely source of contamination and the agency had said that the contamination may have been intentional.
As of Feb 2., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had received 413 reports of elevated blood lead levels linked to the pouches in 43 states.
It’s unclear what regulatory or legal action, if any, the FDA can take against Aguilera. The FDA did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment.
However, the agency said in the release Tuesday that it has “limited authority” over foreign ingredient suppliers who do not directly ship products to the U.S., meaning the agency “cannot take direct action” against Negasmart or Aguilera. It is Austrofoods, not Negasmart or Aguilera, that ultimately ships products to the U.S.
An FDA spokesperson told NBC News last week that if the agency determines that applesauce pouches had been adulterated, it can take regulatory action, which may include “working with the manufacturer to resolve the issue, and, as appropriate, taking steps to prevent the product from entering, or remaining, in the U.S. market.”
The FDA noted that it is working with U.S. Customs and Border Protection to screen for any products from Negasmart or cinnamon being imported from Ecuador.
To date, the spokesperson said, the FDA has confirmed that Negasmart does not ship products directly to the U.S., nor do Negasmart’s customers. The statement did not mention products from Aguilera.

2024-01-12T21:30:14.621Z,Quaker Oats recalls two dozen more products due to salmonella risk,NBC News,"The Quaker Oats Co. is recalling 24 more products after recalling dozens of cereals, granola bars and snacks last month due to potential contamination with salmonella bacteria.
The products recalled Thursday include certain flavors of Cap’n Crunch and Oatmeal Squares cereals, additional types of Chewy granola bars, some Gatorade protein bars and more.
In total, more than 60 Quaker products have been recalled since Dec. 15 due to salmonella concerns. Many of the items are sold in multiple sizes or types of packaging.
The December recall included some batches of Quaker Chewy granola bars, Quaker granola cereals and snack boxes that contain those products. The latest recall adds to the list more Quaker Chewy bars and cereals, as well as Gamesa Marias Cereal, Munchies Munch Mix, Gatorade bars and Cap’n Crunch bars, cereals and instant oatmeals.
In an alert posted Thursday on the Food and Drug Administration website, Quaker said consumers should dispose of any recalled products, which are sold throughout the United States, Puerto Rico, Guam and Saipan. The company is offering reimbursements — its product packaging usually includes a SmartLabel that allows consumers to scan a QR code to determine whether a product has been recalled.
As of Dec. 15, Quaker said it had not confirmed any illnesses related to the recalled products. The company has not publicly said whether any illnesses had been reported since then, and Quaker did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The recall does not include Quaker oats, instant oats, grits, oat bran, oat flour or rice snacks.
While foodborne illnesses are hard to track, salmonella most likely causes more than any other bacteria, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The agency estimates that there are more than 1 million foodborne cases of salmonella in the U.S. each year.
Earlier this month, the CDC announced that 24 people had been sickened from salmonella after consuming ready-to-eat charcuterie meats. And since October, more than 300 salmonella cases and nearly 130 hospitalizations have been linked to cantaloupes. The CDC currently advises people not to eat pre-cut cantaloupe unless they can be certain it came from a brand other than Malichita or Rudy.
Salmonella usually causes diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps six hours to six days after eating a contaminated product. Some people may also develop nausea, vomiting or a headache. These symptoms typically resolve within four to seven days without antibiotics.
However, the infection can be more severe — and sometimes fatal — in children under 5, adults ages 65 and older, and people with weakened immune systems.

2024-03-01T21:39:13.014Z,Map: Where medication abortion is and isn’t legal,NBC News,"The Supreme Court plans to hear a case this month that could curtail access to abortion pills nationwide. The medications are already banned in almost a third of the states.
Access to the two-drug regimen is currently legal in some form in 36 states and Washington, D.C. Medication abortion is legal in 21 states and restricted in the remaining 15, according to data from the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that advocates for abortion access.
But the case that will be argued at the Supreme Court has the potential to end the practice of mailing the drugs and could reinstate requirements that patients visit a doctor in person to obtain abortion pills. A decision would affect access to the medication mifepristone for the 57 million U.S. women of reproductive age who do not live in a state where abortion is banned.
Meanwhile, CVS and Walgreens announced Friday that the pharmacy chains had been certified to dispense the drugs required for medication abortions. The change came as a result of an FDA rule finalized in January 2023 that allows pharmacies to fill prescriptions for the pills. Previously, they could only be obtained at a clinic, medical office or hospital.
Medication abortion accounted for more than half of all U.S. abortions in 2020, according to the Guttmacher Institute.

2024-01-20T12:00:40.000Z,"Cervical cancer increasing in women in their 30s and 40s, new report finds",NBC News,"After decades of good news in the fight against cervical cancer — marked by decades of steady declines in cases and deaths — a new report suggests that some women are being left behind.
Thanks to early detection and treatment, rates of cervical cancer have plummeted by more than half over the past 50 years. Rates are falling fastest among women in their early 20s, the first generation to benefit from HPV vaccines, which were approved in 2006.
HPV, the human papillomavirus, causes six types of cancer, including cervical cancer.
Among women aged 20 to 24, cervical cancer incidence dropped by 65% from 2012 to 2019, according to a report released Wednesday from the American Cancer Society.
“Cervical cancer is one of the best-understood cancers,” said Dr. Nicolas Wentzensen, a senior investigator in the National Cancer Institute’s clinical genetics branch, who was not involved in the new report. “We’ve made amazing progress and it remains a success story.”
Not all women are benefitting from that progress, however.
The overall cervical cancer rate among women of all ages has stopped falling.
Among women in their 30s and early 40s, incidence has been edging upward. Diagnosis of cervical cancer among women ages 30 to 44 rose almost 2% a year from 2012 to 2019.
“We need to make sure we are not forgetting about that generation that was a little too old for HPV vaccination,” said Jennifer Spencer, an assistant professor at the Dell Medical School at University of Texas-Austin who studies population health.
Fortunately, the cancers found in 30- and 40-something women were mostly early, curable tumors, said Ahmedin Jemal, senior author of the new report and the cancer society’s senior vice president for surveillance and health equity science. About 13,800 American women are diagnosed with cervical cancer each year and 4,360 die from the disease.
Researchers didn’t delve into the reasons why cervical cancer is becoming more common for some women, Jemal said.
But screening rates may play a role, said Spencer, who was not involved in the study. Screenings allow doctors to find and remove precancerous lesions before they become cancerous. More than half of women diagnosed with cervical cancer have either never been screened or haven’t been screened in the past five years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Studies show that fewer women are keeping up with routine cervical cancer exams.
The number of women ages 21 to 65 who have been screened according to the latest guidelines fell from 87% in 2000 to 72%, according to the National Cancer Institute.
Other research has found that women ages 21 to 29 were the least likely to be up to date on their screenings, with 29% being overdue. Women were also more likely to be behind schedule if they were nonwhite, uninsured, lived in rural areas or identified as gay, lesbian or bisexual, according to the study.
The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening women ages 21-29 with Pap smears — which examine cells under a microscope — every three years. Women ages 30 to 65 can be screened either every three years with a Pap smear or every five years with an HPV test or combination of the two tests. HPV tests can detect genetic material from the human papilloma virus.
Spencer said it’s possible that low screening rates among 20-something women could help explain the slightly higher cervical cancer rates among women in their 30s and early 40s.
When women in one of Spencer’s studies were asked why they hadn’t been screened recently, they commonly said that they didn’t know they needed to be screened or that a health provider hadn’t recommended it. Only 1% women ages 21 to 29 said they had skipped screening because they had received the HPV shot.
“Clearly, more patient education is needed,” said Dr. Betty Suh-Burgmann, chair of gynecologic oncology for Kaiser Permanente Northern California. Her health care system already reminds women about screenings by postcards, letters and phone calls. This year, Kaiser Permanente will begin texting patients, as well, she said.
Changing guidelines about cervical cancer screening also may have left women and health providers confused, Spencer said. Until the early 2000s, most doctors screened women annually. The task force has updated its guidelines three times in the past two decades, and is in the process of reviewing them again.
Others say the increase in cervical cancer rates among 30- and 40-something women isn’t so easily explained.
Cervical tumors  tend to grow slowly, typically taking a decade or more to morph from precancers to cancers, Wentzensen said. He said there may be other factors at play. For example, he wonders if more women moving to the United States haven’t been screened, putting them at higher risk.
And Spencer notes that screening is just the first step to saving lives. Women with abnormal screening results need to undergo additional testing and, if necessary, treatment.
In a study published last year in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, Spencer and her colleagues found that only 73% of women with abnormal screening results received follow-up care.
“The onus is on the health care system to think about who is slipping through the cracks,” Spencer said.

2024-02-24T13:00:41.000Z,"After Alabama ruling, doctors warn that freezing embryos is essential for IVF",NBC News,"After Alabama’s state Supreme Court ruling on IVF, doctors are warning that women using in vitro fertilization and their babies could face major health risks — and young cancer patients could lose the chance to build a future family — if fertility clinics stop using frozen embryos.
“That is a possible reality,” said Dr. Irene Dimitriadis, a reproductive endocrinologist and infertility specialist at the Mass General Fertility Center in Boston. “It hurts me to think of it because that means we’re kind of going backwards in medicine.”
The court ruled last week that embryos created by IVF are considered children, sparking concerns that embryos that are destroyed or damaged could lead to civil liability. Now some Alabama fertility clinics are halting operations, leaving patients in emotional limbo, as clinics and doctors in other states brace for what they fear will be similar rulings or legislation.
Doctors say they’ve been using frozen embryos for more than 15 years because it’s the safest method for women trying to conceive through IVF.
“The reason we are freezing embryos is to help ensure the health of the woman and the pregnancy and for the babies,” said Dr. Zev Williams, a fertility expert at Columbia University Fertility Center. “There are many cases where it is healthier for the pregnancy, the future child and for the mother to have embryos frozen.”
Freezing embryos for IVF became standard practice after the development of vitrification, a fast-freezing process that is safer for the embryo. While there’s still a risk of damage during the thawing process, doctors say there are fewer complications than the only other option, using fresh embryos.
About 2% of babies are conceived using assisted-reproductive technology in the U.S., according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Some studies suggest using frozen embryos have better success rates, but doctors say the evidence isn’t conclusive.
One big benefit to freezing embryos is that it allows doctors to transfer one embryo at a time to the uterus. Before freezing technology was improved, often many embryos were transferred at once in the hope that at least one would implant and develop into a pregnancy. However, that increased the risk of triplets, quadruplets or more in some cases.
“Most people in that situation will either deliver prematurely, or those fetuses don’t survive because the uterus is not meant to hold multiple babies,” said Dr. Emily Jungheim, chief of reproductive endocrinology and infertility at Northwestern Medicine. “Higher-order multiples are always going to lead to time in the neonatal intensive care unit.”
Multiple babies born prematurely face serious risks like blindness, damage to the bowels and other long-term disabilities, Jungheim said. Mothers pregnant with multiples usually need to have a cesarean section.
“Putting that kind of stress on the body of the mother, we’re just learning about what that can do later in life to her,” she added.
Doctors say freezing embryos also gives a woman’s body time to recover before an embryo is implanted. IVF cycles involve taking medications and hormones to stimulate egg production, which takes a toll on the body.
“When going through an IVF cycle, the lining of the uterus sees higher levels of estrogen, which creates a nontypical environment,” Williams said. “If you put the embryos back in that environment, there’s a higher risk of complications. It’s better not to transfer right away. It’s better for there to be a new, healthier lining.”
Medications used for IVF also put women at risk for ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, a condition that causes the ovaries to swell and become painful. Getting pregnant with this condition is dangerous and can cause blood clots, pulmonary embolisms, even death, said Dimitriadis.
“If I can freeze embryos instead and have her come back later, it’s safer,” Jungheim said.
For young female cancer patients, losing their fertility because of chemotherapy can be as devastating as the cancer diagnosis itself. Having the option to freeze embryos can be the only bright spot during one of the toughest times of their life, doctors say.
“If a woman has cancer and has to go through treatment, that can obliterate her eggs,” Williams said. “If she undergoes IVF and freezes embryos, once she recovers, she has embryos stored to help her build a family.”
Without frozen embryos, doctors say they’ll be unable to screen and diagnose for serious and sometimes fatal genetic conditions like cystic fibrosis or sickle cell disease, which are passed on to children from parents with genetic mutations. Right now, if parents are known carriers, doctors can do small biopsies on the embryos to determine which ones are healthy.
“But in order to do that, we need to be able to freeze the embryo after we biopsy it,” Dimitriadis said. “If we don’t freeze the embryo after we biopsy it, we don’t have time to get the results back from that test.”
Dimitriadis said similar tests can be used for women who have recurrent miscarriages to figure out the cause of those issues and make sure they’re only implanting the healthiest embryos.
“You can imagine the struggles they go through,” she said. “This can save them a lot of the angst and despair that they feel.”

2024-02-29T16:00:41.000Z,"Tweens are getting rashes from some skin care products popularized on social media, dermatologists say",NBC News,"A few days after she began her new skin care regimen — toner, moisturizer, serum and facial mist — the skin around 13-year-old Leora’s lips became red and dry.
A couple days later, the rash turned yellow and crusty.
“I was touching it because it was really itchy, and then I think it got infected,” said Leora, whose family requested her last name not be published for privacy reasons, given that she is a minor.
A dermatologist prescribed Leora a medication to alleviate irritation and advised her to stop her skin care routine and apply petroleum jelly until the rash cleared.
Then came a discussion that dermatologists say is increasingly common: “We got into a whole conversation about this new fad of preteens interested in using a lot of anti-aging products and things that they are learning about on social media,” said Dr. Alexis Young, Leora’s dermatologist at Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey.
“In general for the preteen population, they’re layering product upon product and not really being told how to use them,” Young said.
Young and six other dermatologists told NBC News that in recent months, tweens and young teenagers have been showing up at their offices in droves with red, dry, bumpy and itchy rashes after using skin care products they don’t need. Some dermatologists said it happens monthly or weekly; others said they see such patients multiple times per day.
Kids ages 7 to 13 are clearing the shelves at makeup stores, spending hundreds on anti-aging creams, moisturizers and acne serums from trendy and colorful brands like Drunk Elephant — which sells one Protini Polypeptide Cream every 40 seconds, according the brand’s website — and Glow Recipe, which surpassed $100 million in revenue in 2021, just seven years after its founding, CNBC reported.
The trend has been driven, in part, by social media, where young creators’ videos about their multistep skin care routines sometimes garner millions of views. (Some adults, meanwhile, have taken to social media to vent about makeup stores becoming overrun with children.)
Drunk Elephant and Glow Recipe products aren’t inherently harmful when used as instructed for their intended purpose, and the companies make products that tweens can tolerate. But some contain ingredients that can irritate young skin, dermatologists said.
“It’s a lot for parents, certainly kids, to wade through,” said Dr. Brooke Jeffy, a board-certified dermatologist in Arizona. “They just maybe don’t have the knowledge to know what’s safe, and so it’s difficult.”
Many Drunk Elephant and Glow Recipe products come in bright pink, orange or teal packaging that can attract young customers; a promotional video from Drunk Elephant even depicts a line of travel-size products as animated cartoon characters.
Like many beauty products, the brands’ product labels don’t usually specify an intended age range. Instead, they list the expected effects. Drunk Elephant’s T.L.C. Framboos Glycolic Night Serum, for example, says it “resurfaces dull, congested skin, dramatically improving the appearance of skin’s tone and texture, fine lines, wrinkles, and pores.” Glow Recipe’s Strawberry Smooth BHA + AHA Salicylic Serum, meanwhile, says it can “gently smooth texture, clear breakouts, and refine pores, while calming skin.”
Each of those two products contains exfoliating acids, which the dermatologists interviewed said are among the most problematic ingredients for young people, along with retinoids. Both types of ingredients are intended to address issues like hyperpigmentation, wrinkles or acne, according to Dr. Jayden Galamgam, a dermatologist at UCLA Health. But for young skin without any problems, they may be too harsh, he said.
“We have a handful of patients that get these recurrent rashes around their eyelids and around the mouth,” Galamgam said, adding: “It’s miserable for them. It’s so itchy. It sometimes keeps them up at night. It gets bloody because they keep scratching it, and they’re so embarrassed because it’s on their face and it’s what their friends see.”
In a statement, a Drunk Elephant spokesperson said “anyone with skin can use Drunk Elephant,” but that “different products are appropriate for different ages.”
“We always recommend that parents/guardians provide guidance to their children, particularly before starting a new routine,” the statement said. “In general, we do not recommend products that contain high concentration of active ingredients for our younger fans.”
Glow Recipe did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Young said Leora’s rash was likely caused by a combination of irritating ingredients and the overexfoliating of her skin. Leora said she got interested in skin care through YouTube and her friends.
Her peers want the trendy products from Drunk Elephant and Glow Recipe, she said, in order to feel “preppy” and flaunt their social status.
“It shows off that you have a lot of money if you buy these expensive stuff,” Leora said. “There’s always trends going around, and that’s just how it is, and people are jealous of other people. But now I guess it’s skin care.”
NBC asked YouTube for comment about situations like Leora’s, in which teenagers get inspired to buy products that may be unhealthy for their skin via videos on its platform. In a statement, YouTube referred NBC News to the company’s policies for content pertaining to harmful substances and medical misinformation.
Videos about Drunk Elephant and Glow Recipe products also proliferate on TikTok, which has a user base that skews young. The company did not answer questions regarding minors exposed to such content.
Retinoids, a group of chemical compounds derived from vitamin A, commonly cause issues for tweens and young teens who don’t need them, dermatologists said.
The category includes retinol, which is often found in over-the-counter products and is used to reduce signs of aging. It promotes collagen production and increases the rate that new skin cells replace dead ones. Retinoids can also treat acne.
Tween skin, however, naturally produces plenty of collagen, Jeffy said. Young skin cells turn over approximately every 20 days, she added, while adult skin can take more than twice as long. So retinol is generally unnecessary for teen skin that isn’t acne-prone, and it can irritate and damage the skin barrier, which acts as a first layer of defense. It can also lead to a red or brown, dry and itchy rash called retinoid dermatitis, Jeffy said.
She described a tween patient who developed a rash around her eyes after applying a Drunk Elephant retinol cream: “The sad thing is, she didn’t need a retinol. It’s doing nothing for her, and it’s giving her this rash. It may take a few months for that to totally fade.”
When asked about the anecdote, Drunk Elephant referred NBC News to its statement and to the ""Younger Fans"" section of the FAQ page on its website.
Exfoliating hydroxy acids, meanwhile, cause the surface layer of skin to peel to promote new cell growth, according to the Food and Drug Administration. But since young skin renews quickly, these acids may damage the skin barrier, causing irritation, sun sensitivity, burning and rashes.
Dr. Claire Wolinsky, a dermatologist at Spring Street Dermatology in New York City, said her 11-year-old niece’s skin became red and sensitive after using a Watermelon Glow toner from Glow Recipe that contained beta-hydroxy and polyhydroxy acids.
“Using a chemical exfoliant, multiple of them in your regimen, it’s just going to lead to irritation,” Wolinsky said. “For a kid with perfect skin, it feels like a bad choice.”
Dr. Carol Cheng, a pediatric dermatologist and associate professor at UCLA, said she recommends that children without skin issues keep it simple: a gentle cleanser, moisturizer and sunscreen.
“If there’s nothing to fix, I wouldn’t fix it,” she said.
If a child insists on additional products, parents should avoid retinol and exfoliating hydroxy acids. Both ingredients can appear on labels with a variety of names — including retinyl acetate or all-trans retinoic acid for the former, and glycolic, lactic or citric acid for the latter.
If there’s any doubt about a product, Cheng said, consult a pediatrician or dermatologist.
Her advice to young people: “Don’t try to go out and try to find something wrong with your skin.”

2024-02-22T21:34:27.506Z,Wendy Williams’ aphasia diagnosis puts a spotlight on the neurological condition,NBC News,"The announcement that former talk show host Wendy Williams has been diagnosed with aphasia has put the neurological condition — the same one actor Bruce Willis was diagnosed with in 2022 — back in the spotlight.
Aphasia affects a person's ability to speak, read, write and understand others. The condition usually comes on suddenly from a brain injury or stroke, but in some cases it can develop over time as a result of a neurodegenerative disease. When that happens, the syndrome is known as primary progressive aphasia, or PPA.
Williams' team said Thursday that her PPA diagnosis came last year, after a series of medical tests. Williams, 59, was also diagnosed with dementia.
""Over the past few years, questions have been raised at times about Wendy’s ability to process information and many have speculated about Wendy’s condition, particularly when she began to lose words, act erratically at times, and have difficulty understanding financial transactions,"" her team said in a news release.
Williams' team said that her conditions ""have already presented significant hurdles,"" but that she is ""receiving the care she requires to make sure she is protected and that her needs are addressed.""
Aphasia affects an estimated 2 million people in the U.S., and nearly 180,000 new cases are diagnosed each year, according to the National Aphasia Association.
The symptoms — and their severity — vary based on which type of aphasia a person has. Some severely affect a patient's speech and ability to read and write. Other types leave patients able to understand speech well and read adequately, but cause them to have difficulty finding words, according to the association.
In people with primary progressive aphasia, Williams' diagnosis, language skills become increasingly impaired over time. Some of the first symptoms are issues with speech and language; memory loss generally develops later.
Eventually, almost all people with PPA stop speaking and lose the ability to understand written or spoken language.
Patients with global aphasia, the most severe type, can only produce a few recognizable words, and they understand little spoken language, according to the association. Someone with this type of aphasia cannot read or write.
Aphasia is most often caused by damage to areas of the brain that play a role in speech and language.
Twenty-five to 40% of stroke survivors develop it, according to the National Aphasia Association. It also can develop from a head injury or brain tumor.
Primary progressive aphasia, however, is caused by neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's — it's the result of the degradation of brain tissue. PPA can sometimes progress to a more generalized dementia, according to the Mayo Clinic.
Diagnosing aphasia usually involves an MRI or CT scan, as well as an assessment by a speech-language pathologist.
There is no cure for aphasia. However, depending on the type and severity, speech and language therapy can help some patients if those interventions begin soon after the condition's onset.
Research into the use of certain medications or brain stimulation to treat aphasia is ongoing, but no large-scale, long-term studies have been completed.

2024-02-21T10:01:41.000Z,How the 2024 presidential election may threaten health coverage for millions,NBC News,"The outcome of the presidential election in November could jeopardize coverage for millions, experts warn, even as a record number of people in the United States are signing up for health insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.
Former President Donald Trump has renewed his threat to get rid of the health law if he wins a second term. What’s more, if Republicans gain control of Congress, experts say they would likely let expire the discounts that make Obamacare more affordable for millions of people.
“This election has huge health impacts,” said Chris Meekins, a health policy research analyst at the investment firm Raymond James.
Worries about health care costs are a major reason for negative views of the U.S. economy, a KFF poll released Wednesday found. Nearly three-quarters of adults fear they won’t be able to pay for their medical bills. And 50% of people in the U.S., including almost  a quarter of Republicans, actually want the next president and Congress to expand what the ACA does. Only a third of adults support scaling back the law (14%) or repealing it entirely (18%), the new poll found.
As of Jan. 24, more than 21 million people had signed up for 2024 health insurance plans through Obamacare, according to the latest data from the Department of Health and Human Services — already surpassing the 16 million total sign-ups during the 2023 enrollment period.
While some of that surge in sign-ups is due to people losing Medicaid coverage, a large portion of  it is in response to the government-backed subsidies passed through the Inflation Reduction Act, Meekins said.
The subsidies, which significantly lower the cost of monthly premiums, are offered to individuals or families who would otherwise pay more than 8% of their annual income on Obamacare coverage. (A 50-year-old couple with an annual income of $70,000, for example, could pay around $430 per month in premiums, down from $1,333 per month without the subsidies, according to KFF, a nonpartisan group that studies health policy issues.)
The subsidies were originally passed and put in place for two years, as part of the 2021 Covid relief bill, the American Rescue Plan Act. They were extended for three years under the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022.
These discounts, however, are set to expire at the end of 2025, unless Congress extends them once more, a prospect unlikely under a Republican-controlled Congress or presidency, Meekins said.
“If there’s a Republican president, it is pretty unlikely you would see those expanded subsidies continue,” he said.
More than 3 million Americans could become uninsured if Congress fails to extend the subsidies, said Lawrence Gostin, director of the O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University, adding that the lower premiums have helped people in Republican-led states, such as Florida and Texas, where sign-ups have notably increased in the past decade.
There are already signs that Obamacare or provisions that bolster the health law could be in danger, said Drew Altman, president and CEO of KFF.
Trump, the likely Republican presidential nominee for the 2024 election, is threatening to repeal the health law once again, Altman said. In November, Trump said on social media that “Obamacare Sucks!!!” and that “I want to REPLACE IT with MUCH BETTER HEALTHCARE.”
While a full repeal of Obamacare is unlikely, “it’s difficult to see the subsidies continue if Republicans control every branch of government and Trump is president,” Altman said.
Without the subsidies, people who get their insurance through Obamacare plans could potentially pay hundreds of dollars more each month, making it increasingly difficult to afford their insurance coverage, he said.
GiGi Malinchak, 64, of Boyertown, Pennsylvania, is among those who would not be able to afford Obamacare coverage without the subsidies. She runs her own small business and, for three years now, her husband has been retired. She said she likes her coverage; about 18 months ago, she suffered a stroke and she said most of her medical expenses were covered.
She currently pays around $12 a month for coverage. In the absence of discounts, she said, it would likely cost hundreds of dollars more.
“Without the subsidies, 100% of my husband’s Social Security income would have gone to pay for my health insurance,” Malinchak said.
A recent analysis from Raymond James, which looked at Obamacare sign-up rates from 2014 to 2024, found that enrollments increased from around 11.5 million to 21.5 million during President Joe Biden’s term.
The most substantial increase in sign-ups during the period, according to the analysis, has occurred in states governed by Republicans, such as Florida and Texas. Many of these states have not adopted Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion, which increased the number of people with low incomes who qualified for coverage.
John Graves, a professor of health policy and medicine at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, said people with higher incomes would likely see the most outsized impact if the subsidies are allowed to expire.
Obamacare, he said, would still be required to provide subsidies to people with very low incomes —  at or below four times the poverty level — even if the subsidies extended under the Inflation Reduction Act should expire.
“If they’re paying $2,000 one year and then $12,000 the next, that entire increase in the premium falls on the patient,” Graves said.
Alison Farrell, 43, of Phoenix, Arizona, said that she would find it  “alarming” if Congress did not extend the subsidies.
Last October, she left her job at a corporate commercial real-estate firm to start a small business. She currently benefits from the extended subsidies under Obamacare.
Farrell pays around $700 in monthly premiums for herself, her husband and two daughters. Without the subsidies, that cost would balloon to around $1,100 a month.
She said that she would still be able to pay that higher cost, but it would “definitely be a strain.”
“My income isn’t what it used to be since leaving my job,” Farrell said. “It would be a lot harder.”

2024-03-08T20:43:15.689Z,Doctors call attention to 'margarita rashes' from sun exposure as spring approaches,NBC News,"With spring approaching, dermatologists are spreading awareness of a lesser-known skin condition associated with sun exposure.
Handling certain foods like limes and then going into the sun may cause an itchy rash or sunburn on areas of the body that the citrus juice touched. In severe cases, people may develop blisters that require an emergency room visit.
The condition, photocontact dermatitis, can be caused by anything that makes skin more sensitive to the sun — including certain skincare products, medication or plants. It's sometimes called “margarita rash” because people may get it after juicing limes for margaritas then sitting outside.
""The right exposure to the right citrus in the right sunlight will cause this in anybody"" — including all skin types, said Dr. Brandon Adler, an assistant professor of dermatology at Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California.
“A lot of people falsely assume that it’s only fairer-skinned individuals who develop sun sensitivity, and that is patently false,” he said. “There’s a good body of data that’s emerged showing that people with darker skin tones are also susceptible.”
Adler is set to discuss the topic Sunday at the American Academy of Dermatology’s 2024 Annual Meeting.
Dr. Melissa Piliang, a dermatologist at Cleveland Clinic, said she sees a couple of patients with photocontact dermatitis every summer — most commonly, people who handled citrus fruits, though the condition is also associated with handling celery, trimming fig trees or touching plants like hogweed or St. John’s wort.
Piliang said these items contain furocoumarins — chemical compounds found naturally in some plants and fruits that are activated by the sun's long-wave ultraviolet light, or UVA rays.
Photocontact dermatitis can be distinguished from other skin conditions because there's often a pattern from where a food or plant touched the body, Piliang said.
“If somebody is at a barbecue, they’re making margaritas, they splash lime on their arm and then they’re outside in the sun, they get sunburned in the pattern of the lime splash,"" she said. “Or, they got lime on their hand and they had a shirt off and they put their hand on their belly and then they have a big sunburn handprint.”
Adlers said the reactions often show up hours to days after an exposure. A rash may disappear quickly in some cases, but linger in others, he said.
“Sometimes these can be very chronic conditions where the rash actually doesn’t always go away, even if somebody is starting to avoid the sun. That can make it very hard in some cases for even the patient to realize that this is a sun-related condition,” Adler said.
Other forms of photocontact dermatitis don't involve a burn or rash. For example, some people develop dark patches that aren't painful or itchy, but can last years before going away.
The patches ""often look streaky from the juice running down your skin,"" Adler said.
In rarer cases, people may have an allergic form of photocontact dermatitis — an allergy to a certain product, like sunscreen, that only occurs when they're exposed to sunlight.
While this version of photocontact dermatitis is less common, Adler said his research suggests it may be under-diagnosed. The only way to tell if someone has it is to do a photo patch test, which involves taping patches with small amounts of an allergen to the skin and exposing those patches to UVA light.
Allergic forms of photocontact dermatitis are usually itchy or scaly and look like eczema, Adler said. They typically clear up once people switch to a different product that doesn't contain the allergen.
""This in no way implies anyone need to avoid sunscreens or that sunscreens are dangerous,"" Adler said.
People can also get rashes or burns after taking certain medications — such as common blood pressure medications — and being out in the sun. In those cases, the rash would appear on parts of the body that were exposed to the sun’s rays.
Adler said there's likely a main ingredient in these medications that gets activated by ultraviolet light.
""Probably there’s a different mechanism for each drug, and it’s not so well understood, but what we do know is: You stop the medication, the sun sensitivity goes away,"" he said.
The simplest way to prevent photocontact dermatitis is to wash your hands thoroughly, Piliang said.
""If you're going to squeeze limes or make guacamole or make margaritas, wash your hands afterwards with soap and water to get all that juice off — maybe your forearms and elbows down,"" she said.
To treat a rash or burn, apply a cool compress or a mild topical steroid like 1% hydrocortisone. People can also take an over-the-counter anti-inflammatory like ibuprofen, Piliang said.
""If you have blisters, especially blisters over wide areas of the body, then you should seek help. See a physician, see a dermatologist,"" she said.
But for most people, Adler said, the best treatment is steering clear of whatever food, plant or product is triggering a skin reaction.
""It's not about, 'Let's prescribe prescribe something,'"" he said. ""It's like, 'Let's figure out how to avoid what's causing the problem.'""

2024-01-14T11:00:40.000Z,Blood donations have fallen to catastrophic levels. Experts say young people need to step up.,NBC News,"It was a white T-shirt bearing the likeness of Snoopy wearing shades and leaning effortlessly against the iconic American Red Cross logo that prompted a surge in blood donations in the spring of 2023.
“Be cool. Give blood,” the shirt urged. The message — on young people, anyway — was effective. More than 70,000 people under age 35 responded to the call, rolling up their sleeves and giving blood in exchange for the coveted tees.
The need for blood is urgent. Over the holidays, the Red Cross had 7,000 fewer units of blood available than were needed by hospitals, said Dr. Eric Gehrie, the executive medical director of the American Red Cross. The organization speculated it would need about 8,000 additional donations every week in January to ensure that hospitals are fully supplied, he added.
The Snoopy campaign’s intent, the Red Cross said, was to prompt teens and young adults to give blood for the first time. That would hopefully spark lifelong habits of donating — habits that could help reverse a decadeslong decline in blood donations.
“In the last 20 years, we’ve seen about a 40% decrease in donors overall to the Red Cross,” Gehrie said. “The earlier that we can connect with someone, and they donate in high school, they typically will become lifelong donors.”
But the percentage of teens and young adults who have donated blood has steadily fallen since 2013, according to the federal National Blood Collection and Utilization Survey.
From 2019 to 2021, the survey found, blood donations among 16- to 18-year-olds dropped by 60%. And donations among 19- to 24-year-olds dropped by nearly a third.
The pandemic certainly played a role in that decline, but experts worry that the numbers will stay low.
“If that trend continues, we’re going to be in a very difficult situation,” said Dr. Claudia Cohn, chief medical officer for the Association for the Advancement of Blood & Biotherapies. “Blood centers often depend upon high schools for their blood drives.”
“The best donors tend to be from the baby boomer generation,” Cohn said. “Unfortunately, younger people are not getting out and replacing those numbers as we need them to.”
Part of it may be due to changes put into place by the Food and Drug Administration in 2015, setting new thresholds for blood donors.
The agency increased the hemoglobin level required to donate. Hemoglobin molecules contain iron, an essential mineral that Cohn said tends to be lower in menstruating teen girls and young women. The FDA’s change was meant to reduce the risk of iron deficiency after donation.
The FDA also tweaked minimum height and weight requirements needed to donate blood. In general, a person needs to weigh at least 110 pounds.
While those minimum thresholds were established to protect donors, Gehrie said, the changes were most likely to impact first-time, young adult donors.
“We had a lot of high school donors that were deferred” because of the changes, Gehrie said. “We don’t want those young donors to get the impression that because they were deferred for that reason, that they can never donate again.”
The problem worsened during the pandemic. High schools, colleges and offices occupied by 20-somethings were once places that blood banks could go to encourage young people to donate. Those common blood drive sites were sidelined as students and employees worked from home.
But many schools and offices that held blood drives pre-Covid have not resumed the programs, according to the Red Cross.
The Snoopy effect of 2023 has not lasted. This month, the Red Cross is hoping to bring back the magic by offering anyone who gives blood a chance to win Super Bowl tickets. Neither the Red Cross nor the Association for the Advancement of Blood & Biotherapies said they had other campaigns targeting youth in the pipeline.

2024-02-08T22:46:06.983Z,Pharma CEOs grilled by senators over sky-high drug prices,NBC News,"WASHINGTON — Lawmakers sharply criticized the CEOs of three major drugmakers during a Senate committee hearing on Thursday, saying the exorbitant cost of prescription drugs in the U.S. means many Americans are unable to afford the medications they need to live.
Prescription drug prices in the U.S. are notoriously higher than other countries, a stark discrepancy that Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee Chair Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., called out.
The high prices mean people go without the medications, Sanders said.
“How many die as a result of that, how many suffer unnecessarily,” he asked. “Nobody knows. But my guess is in the millions.”
Senators heard testimony from Johnson & Johnson’s Joaquin Duato, Merck’s Robert Davis and Bristol Myers Squibb’s Chris Boerner. J&J and Merck's executives only agreed to testify after Sanders threatened to subpoena them.
The hearing came shortly after the Biden administration kicked off drug price negotiations for the 10 costliest medications for Medicare recipients.
All three drugmakers have filed lawsuits against the federal government to stop the negotiations, which are a provision in the Inflation Reduction Act.
Five of the 10 drugs up for negotiations — blood thinners Eliquis and Xarelto, diabetes drug Januvia, blood cancer drug Imbruvica and arthritis drug Stelara — are made by one of the three companies.
The yawning gap between the prices the three drugmakers charge in the U.S. versus other countries for the same drug was the reason three executives were called to testify, Sanders said.
According to Sanders:
The CEOs defended the costs, saying those high prices are based on the “value” the medications give patients.
They also noted that the higher prices mean U.S. patients often get access to the medications years before people in other countries.
""This is in stark contrast to many systems outside the United States, which while they may deliver lower prices, carry an often overlooked trade off that patients often wait longer for new medicines,"" Boerner, of Bristol Myers Squibb, said.
The executives also said that if the U.S. cuts the prices of their medications, they will be unable to invest in developing new medicines.
""Future treatment breakthroughs hinge on what we do now,"" Davis said.
Sanders countered that the companies spend more on executive compensation, stock buybacks and dividend payments to investors than on research and development.
The ranking member of the committee, Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., agreed with Sanders that drug prices are unreasonably high in the U.S. However, he also worried that aggressive policies that cut the price of drugs might discourage drugmakers from making investments in new medicines.
""Now we want to create incentive, but we want to be able to provide access; without access it’s as if the drug has never been invented,"" he said.
The CEOs said that they supported lower out-of-pocket costs for consumers and pointed the finger at insurance companies and middlemen known as pharmacy benefit managers, which negotiate rebates with drug companies on behalf of insurance plans.
Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., was skeptical that the executives supported lowering drug costs, asking them why they were ""actively trying to prevent generics from the market.""
Bristol Myers Squibb's Eliquis, for example, was originally set to allow generic competition in 2019, but the drugmaker filed new patents that extended the drug's exclusivity for several more years.
Boerner addressed that, telling Hassan, ""We have allowed generic entry in 2028.""
""So we have two generics ready to go,"" Hassan responded. ""Your original patent also past expired, but you still are actively trying to prevent generics from coming to market.""

2024-01-09T23:01:52.991Z,States have been eliminating taxes on period products for years. Here’s where you'll still pay them.,NBC News,"Over a lifetime, period products in the U.S. cost a total of around $6,000 per person, according to research published in 2021 — and that’s before tax.
In 21 states, a sales tax of between 4% and 7% applies to items like pads and tampons, making them more costly, data from the Alliance for Period Supplies show.
Most states don’t tax certain essential goods, such as grocery store produce, canned food and prescription medicines. But in states with a ""tampon tax"" — a term that usually applies to tampons plus many other menstrual care products — these products are considered ""luxury items."" (Broader still is the so-called pink tax, which isn’t an actual tax and refers to instances in which items marketed toward women, such as razors, deodorants and shampoo, cost more than equivalent products marketed toward men.)
Over the last four decades, states with sales tax have been enacting laws that eliminate such taxes on menstrual products. Minnesota was the first to do so in 1981, and 23 others have followed suit, along with Washington, D.C.
Texas was the most recent: Since September, there has been no state sales tax on period products there. In Kentucky, two bills that would waive its tampon tax — one Republican-sponsored and the other Democrat-sponsored — were introduced last week.
The map below shows which states have tampon taxes and which don’t. Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire and Oregon don’t have sales tax on any products.
Lacey Gero, director of government relations for the Alliance For Period Supplies, said Southeastern states often follow Texas’ model for their own legislation, so more may eliminate tampon taxes in the coming years.
""We’ve already heard from states like Alabama, where there is going to be a big bipartisan push for legislation to exempt both diapers and period products from sales tax this year,"" she said. ""So I think the wave is already happening.""
Kentucky Rep. Lisa Willner, a Democrat who introduced one of the state’s two bills aimed at the tampon tax, said legislation in other states may bode well for her own effort.
""Kentucky is a deep red state, so seeing this be successful in other red states absolutely is a very hopeful sign that this need not be a partisan issue at all. It’s a public health issue,"" she said.
Roughly a quarter of teens and a third of adults reported having trouble affording period products in a 2023 survey from the underwear brand Thinx and the nonprofit organization PERIOD. The issue is more pronounced among Black and Latinx people compared to white people.
Many public health experts see period products as essential goods: If they’re harder to find or afford, people may stretch a particular product’s use longer, which can raise the risk of infection or toxic shock syndrome — a rare, life-threatening condition. Some people may also miss work or school while on their period if they don’t have access to menstrual care products, or forgo other basic necessities in order to purchase them.
""It’s like, 'Do I spend money on gas to get to school or do I buy period products? Or, when I’m in class, I might be concerned about bleeding through clothes — so do I go to class or do I just skip it?'"" said Jhumka Gupta, an associate professor of public health at George Mason University.
Gupta’s research has shown that not being able to afford menstrual products is linked to a higher likelihood of depression.
There are still several obstacles to eliminating the tampon tax nationwide.
""One of the things that states are grappling with right now is tense and stricter budget cycles are coming up, so there is a fear of loss of revenue,"" Gero said.
Willner said that’s a challenge in Kentucky, where the income tax rate has decreased over the last two years. A state policy passed in 2022 aims to gradually lower individual income taxes until they’re eliminated, as long as a set of fiscal requirements are met.
Willner added that some state legislators also question whether the tampon tax should go away.
""There are a number of my colleagues who don’t see the importance of this, or they’ll say, 'It’s just such a small amount of money' or, 'Why is this even needed?'"" she said. ""Of course, the people who ask those questions tend to be people who aren’t affected by sales tax on menstrual products.""
In addition to waiving the tampon tax, Willner’s bill would set aside $2 million for Kentucky public schools to supply free menstrual products to students in grades 6 through 12. The Republican-sponsored bill does not call for such funding. Willner said she added the provision after hearing from middle and high school students about the embarrassment and anxiety they felt over having or expecting their period at school.
""It brought back memories for me,"" Willner said.
However, she added, that provision could make it more challenging to get the bill passed.
""I have to say I’m a little skeptical that it will,"" she said.
In 25 states and Washington, D.C., period products are supposed to be provided to students for free. Arizona, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, New Jersey and Ohio all passed legislation creating such policies last year. But not all 25 states allocate money for this purpose, so it’s often up to schools to apply for grants or pay for the products themselves.
Gero said that advocates for free period products are pushing for additional legislation that would expressly set aside funding for schools to provide them.
In the future, states might also consider bills that make period products free in public restrooms, she added. Ann Arbor, Michigan, became the first city to do that after passing a bill in 2021.
""We’re just excited that more local level initiatives are happening, because it’s putting the pressure on the states to take more action,"" Gero said.

2024-01-25T22:03:21.003Z,The U.S. just sold its helium stockpile. Here’s why the medical world is worried.,NBC News,"On Thursday, the U.S. government sold the Federal Helium Reserve, a massive underground stockpile based in Amarillo, Texas, that supplies up to 30% of the country’s helium.
Once the deal is finalized, the buyer — which will likely be the highest bidder, the industrial gas company Messer — will claim some 425 miles of pipelines spanning Texas, Kansas and Oklahoma, plus about 1 billion cubic feet of the only element on Earth cold enough to make an MRI machine work.
Regulatory and logistical issues with the facility threaten a temporary shutdown as it passes from public to private ownership, and hospital supply chain experts worry the sale could have serious consequences for health care down the road — especially when it comes to MRIs.
To be sure, a Federal Helium Reserve shutdown wouldn’t mean that MRIs would suddenly power down across the country, said Soumi Saha, senior vice president of government affairs at Premier Inc., which contracts with helium suppliers on behalf of 4,400 hospitals in the U.S. “But we are stressing about this shortage. From a health care perspective, MRI machines are the No. 1 concern.”
American patients undergo an estimated 40 million MRI scans each year to help diagnose cancer, brain and spinal cord injuries, strokes and heart conditions. The superconductive magnet-powered imaging machines give doctors clear, high-resolution images of areas inside the body they can’t see on X-rays and CT scans. But without liquid helium, the Earth’s coldest element, MRI machines can’t keep their magnets cool enough to generate these images.
The sale of the government’s stockpile of the nonrenewable element could exacerbate an existing supply shortage, Saha said.
A number of factors could trigger a shutdown of the facility that could last as long as three years, said Rich Gottwald, CEO of the Compressed Gas Association, a trade group that represents companies, including Messer, that buy up helium and sell it to hospitals, semiconductor manufacturers, NASA and other customers.
The facility spans three states, each with its own laws. The federal government didn’t need to reconcile state-specific rules, but a private buyer would, he said. Another issue is that helium must be enriched before it can be used, and a separate system is needed to do that. That enrichment system isn’t part of the federal reserve, but is privately owned by four private companies, including Messer; unlike the pipelines and helium itself, it wasn’t for sale.
“A new owner will need to create some sort of lease to use the enrichment unit, or build their own unit to enrich the helium,” Gottwald said. “There’s a whole host of issues that need to be resolved and the concern is, until they’re resolved, the system will need to shut down.”
In a letter in October urging the White House to delay the sale, the CGA and four other trade associations laid out what they see as the most critical issues at the facility. Two of the trade associations behind the letter, AdvaMed and the Medical Imaging and Technology Alliance, represent MRI manufacturers.
“Timely, critical patient care would suffer if helium supplies constricted further,” Scott Whitaker, AdvaMed’s CEO, wrote in an email to NBC News. “AdvaMed urges the White House to delay the sale and privatization of the Federal Helium Reserve until outstanding issues identified by the Compressed Gas Association are resolved.”
The sale has been in the works for more than a decade. Congress first mandated it through the Helium Stewardship Act of 2013. It was initially supposed to occur in 2021, but a series of delays — in part due to the same logistical and regulatory issues threatening shutdowns today — postponed the auction to Thursday.
In an emailed statement, a spokesperson from the U.S. Interior Department said the sale would not constrict helium supply.
“Sale of the reserve to a private party, as Congressionally mandated by law, is not expected to meaningfully change the availability of helium,” the spokesperson wrote.
There’s a finite amount of helium on Earth. The largest reserves are in massive underground pockets in parts of Algeria, Qatar, Russia and the U.S.
While the Texas stockpile is the largest source of helium in the U.S., it’s not the only one. There are a number of smaller, privately owned facilities — some of which are in Colorado and Wyoming — according to Gottwald.
Sourcing helium inside the U.S. or from Canada is the easiest and cheapest option. Transit time is an important factor: If the shipment takes longer than 35 to 48 days, the liquid helium will evaporate.
The two other biggest helium reserves are in Qatar and Russia.
“Shutting down the U.S. helium reserve would force a situation where we would have to increase our reliance on foreign sources, like Qatar and Russia,” Saha said. “Given the ongoing geopolitical concerns and tensions in those regions and shipping delays, it would increase concerns around potential shortages on U.S. soil.”
According to Phil Kornbluth, president of Kornbluth Helium Consulting, the U.S. hasn’t been able to tap into Russia’s helium supply because of strained trade relations and the war in Ukraine. Meanwhile, attacks on ships in the Red Sea by Yemen’s Houthi rebels have forced Qatar to send liquified natural gas shipments, which contain helium, around the Cape of Good Hope, a route that adds at least 20 days to the journey.
Helium was already in short supply before the government sale. Currently, Kornbluth said, three out of five U.S. helium suppliers are rationing the element to prioritize life-or-death uses like MRI machines ahead of less-essential helium uses, like keeping party balloons afloat.
Across the University of California system, for instance, which includes 10 research campuses and six medical schools, the shortage has already hit scientists.
“We’ve been on and off allocation for a while from our helium suppliers,” said Jeremy Meadows, its executive director of strategic sourcing. “There’s a priority of allocation where health care goes first and research goes second.” This has been difficult for scientists whose laboratories use magnetic imaging for medical research, he said.
“Our helium-dependent research is only growing,” he added. Should the available supply decline further, he said, “I just don’t know how we position ourselves to get that supply.”
In a letter to the U.S. government last spring, the University of California’s chief procurement officer, Paul Williams, lamented that the cost of helium had already increased more than 400% in five years.
Further supply constriction, he wrote, “leaves the research and medical communities at a greater risk.”
For instance, the University of California has a powerful helium-reliant magnetoencephalography, or MEG, scanner, that doctors use to plan pediatric brain operations. Statewide, Williams said, there were only two of these scanners.
“If it runs out of helium, it will require multiple weeks to recool, delaying surgeries, or, in some circumstances, compelling surgeons to operate without detailed brain maps,” he said, adding that the MEG scanner has barely averted shutdown dozens of times over the past 10 years.
MRI manufacturers have responded to the uncertain future of helium with their own solutions. Both Philips and Siemens Healthineers recently started selling alternatives to traditional MRI machines, which hold 1,700 to 1,800 liters of liquid helium and require constant replenishment. Some models now require just 1 to 7 liters of helium and don’t need any replenishment. Spokespeople from both companies touted these newer models as cost-effective for hospitals, especially if helium prices keep rising.
But an MRI machine is a long-term investment, and many hospitals have been counting on their current, helium-dependent MRI equipment to last years, if not decades, more.
“Using the same magnet for 20 or 30 years is not unheard of,” said Dr. Scott Reeder, chair of the University of Wisconsin’s radiology department.
Premier’s Saha said uptake of lower-helium MRIs has been slow.
“There are capital costs associated with removing the old MRIs and installing new equipment, plus the manufacturers don’t have the capacity to switch out all MRI machines at 6,000 U.S.-based hospitals overnight,” she said. “There’s time required for that, and you can’t take off every MRI machine in the country, because that would impact patient care.”
Still, the uncertain helium supply has brought an uptick in interest in these newer models, Saha said. “We’re seeing health care providers trying to get ahead of this by inquiring about MRI systems that use minimal to no helium,” she said.
As the health care industry worries about what the Federal Helium Reserve sale could mean for meeting the existing MRI demand, Reeder said the demand keeps rising, too.
“MRI is playing an increasingly important role in detection, treatment, monitoring and prognosis of so many diseases, and we’re going to have to think carefully as a field about how to ensure the supply chain doesn’t get to a state of crisis,” he said.
That state of crisis hasn’t hit yet, experts stressed. Patients across the U.S. won’t suddenly face canceled MRIs and missed cancer diagnoses once the sale goes through.
But the future of this critical, lighter-than-air element is certainly in flux, Saha said, and the medical world is watching closely.
“Our hope is that health care will be prioritized, but that’s never a guarantee during any shortage of any item,” she said.
For now, Reeder suggested, helium consumers must be judicious. “It’s probably not good to use helium for party balloons anymore,” he said.

2024-02-12T08:01:40.000Z,"Pickleball-related injuries are on the rise, doctors say",NBC News,"As pickleball’s popularity has skyrocketed, so have the number of serious injuries among players.
Bone fractures related to pickleball have increased 200% over the last 20 years, according to an analysis of a large government injury database presented at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons on Monday.
Pickleball, which is played with a perforated plastic ball and wooden paddles on a badminton-sized court, is the fastest growing sport in the U.S., with the number of players rising from 4.8 million in 2021 to 8.9 million in 2023, according to USA Pickleball.
The overall rate of injuries is likely much higher. The new analysis only looked at fractures, not the most common soft tissue injuries like sprained ankles or debilitating knee injuries such as damage to the ACL, or anterior cruciate ligament. Other common pickleball injuries include rotator cuff injuries, worsening of arthritis, Achilles tendon tears/strains and foot fractures.
The vast majority of the fractures found in the new study, 92%, occurred during falls.
“While pickleball is a great sport, nothing is without risk,” said the study’s lead author, Yasmine Ghattas, who is in her last year of medical school at the University of Central Florida College of Medicine in Orlando.
The researchers aren’t arguing for people to quit playing pickleball, just to be better prepared. “Well informed participation in any activity is key,” she said.
Ghattas had a personal interest in the topic.
“My fiancé and I play pickleball regularly and are both entering the orthopedic field,” she said. “During our clinical rotations, we noticed more and more patients coming in with pickleball-related fractures, so we looked to see if there were any studies and there weren’t, so we decided to take a deeper dive.”
The database the researchers used to explore the topic, the Consumer Product Safety Commission’s National Electronic Injury Surveillance System, contained a representative sample of injuries gathered from 100 U.S. emergency departments. Ghattas and her colleagues found descriptions of 377 pickleball-related fractures in the database between 2002 and 2022, which, when extrapolated to the entire U.S. population, totaled to approximately 5,400 pickleball-related fractures annually.
Women, especially those ages 65 and older, were more likely than men to experience a fracture. Most of those fractures were in upper-body bones, such as those in the forearms and hands. The researchers suspect they were related to osteoporosis or other bone-thinning conditions.
Even though women had more fractures overall, men were 2.3 times more likely to be admitted to the hospital after breaking a bone. Ghattas and her colleagues suspect that’s because men’s fractures tended to be in bones of the lower body, such as the hip and femur, which are more likely to result in a hospital stay than fractures in the upper body.
While the rise in injuries may mostly be tied to the growth of the sport, other factors may be coming into play, said Dr. Eric Bowman, an assistant professor of orthopedic surgery at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
For example, some of the people taking up the sport may not have learned enough about it in advance, said Bowman, who was not involved in the study.
“It’s not enough to just pick up a paddle and get out there,” he said. “As with any sport, you have to learn the mechanics and the form that leads to better performance and injury prevention. Some people may not have learned enough, or be physically prepared in advance.”
A study co-authored by Bowman that has not yet been published finds that between 2017 and 2022, the incidence of pickleball-related injuries rose faster than the growth of the sport’s popularity.
Bowman’s study found that soft tissue injuries were the most common overall. Fractures and a worsening of arthritis were increasingly found in patients 60 and older.
While a sport like pickleball might be good for the cardiovascular system, the study shows that people need to be careful about how they begin, said Dr. Spencer Stein, an assistant professor of orthopedic surgery in the division of sports medicine at NYU Langone Health in New York City.
“You want to be careful any time you enter a new sport,” Stein said. “You should get checked by your primary care doctor and get screened for osteoporosis or thinning bones.”
It’s also important that you warm up before playing and choose the right shoes for the sport, Stein said. And you should learn a very important skill: falling in a way that’s unlikely to lead to injury, he said. “If you fall more towards your side, you can protect your head but not putting your wrists at risk,” he added.
People tend to think of pickleball as relatively safe because it’s a lower-impact sport than tennis, for example, Stein said. But even so, competitiveness may lead people to overdo it.
Stein notes that middle-aged women may already be losing bone, which puts them at risk for fractures. That’s why it’s important to get a bone scan, he said. “Typically people start getting those scans at 65, but if there’s a family history of fractures it makes sense to start earlier, even as young as age 50,” he added.

2024-02-06T22:27:08.653Z,"After Toby Keith’s death, doctors warn that stomach cancer signs are easy to miss",NBC News,"Country singer Toby Keith died Monday night at age 62, more than two years after he was diagnosed with stomach cancer.
In June 2022, Keith announced on X that he had been diagnosed in fall 2021 and had already received chemotherapy, radiation and surgery.
Then last June, he told The Oklahoman newspaper of Oklahoma City that his tumor had shrunk by a third and that he was continuing chemotherapy. He also received immunotherapy, he said — medicine that helps the immune system destroy cancer cells.
His death has sparked renewed calls from doctors to pay attention to signs of stomach cancer, which include heartburn, acid reflux, anemia, nausea, ulcers, pain after eating, sudden weight loss or feeling full after eating small amounts.
“A lot of these things are relatively innocuous. But of course with a cancer, that’s how it gets you,” said Dr. Fabian Johnston, the division chief of gastrointestinal oncology at Johns Hopkins Medicine.
Johnston said doctors and patients may be inclined to dismiss symptoms like acid reflux as harmless, which can delay diagnoses. By the time symptoms appear, many already have advanced disease, he said.
The average age of diagnosis is 68, and men have a slightly higher risk.
The American Cancer Society estimates that nearly 27,000 new cases of stomach cancer will be diagnosed this year, though the disease is still relatively rare: It makes up around 1.5% of new cancers diagnosed in the U.S. each year.
Overall rates of stomach cancer diagnoses have also declined slightly over the last 10 years. But rates among adults younger than 50 are rising, for reasons that aren’t clear.
“There’s something that’s going on — something we’re eating, something we’re ingesting, some combination of factors that’s modern and present — which is resulting in these increased cancers in young people,” said Dr. Ben Schlechter, a gastrointestinal medical oncologist at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston.
Schlechter said alcohol and tobacco — once common contributors to stomach cancer — are now associated with a minority of cases in the U.S., perhaps because people are smoking less.
Instead, many new cases are found in people with chronic acid reflux or infections with a bacterium called Helicobacter pylori, which can cause inflammation in the stomach. However, scientists haven’t pinpointed why certain people with those conditions get stomach cancer and most do not.
For many patients right now, “it’s a disease of bad luck,” Schlechter said. “Maybe there’s an association with H. pylori infection. Maybe there’s a history of heartburn or reflux, but usually it’s not as clear.”
Schlechter said stomach cancer is generally aggressive compared to other cancers.
“It doesn’t mean that people are imminently dying. It just means that the tools that we have to cure them are pretty limited,” he said. “People do pretty well compared to 15 years ago, but we are hardly at the level of, say, breast cancer, where the commanding majority of people are cured with surgery and chemotherapy and things like that.”
Up to 95% of stomach cancers in the U.S. are adenocarcinomas, which start in the innermost lining of the stomach. From there, the cancer may spread to the stomach wall, the body of the stomach or the lymph nodes.
Patients whose cancer hasn't spread often undergo or receive chemotherapy or immunotherapy or a combination of these options, said Dr. Rutika Mehta, a medical oncologist in the Gastrointestinal Oncology Program at Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Florida.
""In more advanced cases, we are not yet at a point where we can offer patients a ‘cure,’” Mehta wrote by email. However, she added that chemotherapy or immunotherapy may help prolong lives.
Doctors are also getting better at matching patients with treatments that target specific proteins associated with stomach cancers. For instance, some stomach cancers express a gene called HER2, which is also linked to breast cancer.
“The drugs that work in HER2 breast cancer to some degree work in HER2 gastric cancer. So we can now give those drugs to people with stomach cancer and substantially boost their benefit from treatment,"" Schlechter said.
Though outcomes of the disease are ""generally poor,"" he said, they're ""much better than they used to be.""

2024-03-04T17:40:32.755Z,1st OTC birth control pill expected to be available as early as month's end,NBC News,"Opill, the first non-prescription birth control pill approved in the United States, is expected to hit store shelves at major retailers and pharmacies nationwide around the end of the month or early April, the pill’s maker, Perrigo, said Monday.
The oral contraceptive was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for over-the-counter sales last July. Known as a ""mini-pill,"" it contains one hormone, progestin, and is taken daily.
Major medical organizations, including the American Medical Association and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, have been pushing for years for an over-the-counter birth control pill. Such options are already in more than 100 other countries, according to Free the Pill, an advocacy group.
“We are excited to learn that Opill is now available for shipping and look forward to this over-the-counter contraception soon becoming available for purchase by people in need of oral hormonal birth control,” ACOG President Dr. Verda Hicks said in a statement.
A one-month supply will cost $19.99 and a three-month supply will cost $49.99, Perrigo said in a statement. A six-month supply will be available to purchase online for $89.99. It will be available to preorder as early as this week, the drugmaker said.
Victoria Nichols, project director of Free the Pill, said the availability of the oral birth control pill is a ""landmark moment.""
However, Nichols said, ""Opill's suggested retail price will create barriers to access, especially for young people and those working to make ends meet.""
Over-the-counter medications typically aren’t covered by insurance.
Almost half of the 6.1 million pregnancies in the United States each year are unintended, according to the FDA.
Opill’s rollout comes amid a wave of legal battles over women’s reproductive rights following the 2022 Supreme Court Dobbs decision that overturned Roe v. Wade. This spring, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in a case that takes aim at policies that have expanded access to mifepristone, the drug most commonly used in medication abortions.
A survey published in 2022 by KFF, a nonpartisan group that studies health policy issues, found that more than three-quarters of women of reproductive age said they favored an over-the-counter pill. The leading reason for supporting the switch from prescription to over the counter was convenience.
Experts at an FDA advisory committee meeting last year said that an over-the-counter pill would be especially important for teenagers, who often have barriers to seeing a doctor or just haven’t seen an OB-GYN yet. (When the FDA approved Opill, it was for all users of reproductive age, including teens.)
Opill was found to be 93% effective in preventing pregnancy with typical use, according to a study presented at the committee meeting, similar to prescription birth control pills. The pill must be taken at the same time every day or there is the risk of an unintended pregnancy.
In its approval, the FDA noted that side effects such as irregular bleeding may require seeing a doctor.

2024-02-01T17:21:58.924Z,"Black women under 35 with high blood pressure may have triple the risk of stroke, study says",NBC News,"Black women who develop high blood pressure before age 35 may have triple the risk of having a stroke by middle age, new data suggests.
The findings come as the medical community has noted with concern that the rates of stroke are increasing among middle-aged adults, while stroke rates in older individuals have been steadily decreasing over decades, according to lead study author Dr. Hugo Aparicio, an associate professor of neurology at Boston University. The study will be presented next week at the American Stroke Association’s international conference in Phoenix.
“The message needs to go out that hypertension and stroke are not diseases of the elderly,” Aparicio said. “These are things that can happen to younger people — and that Black women in particular have to be aware of the increased risk and advocate for themselves.”
Black women are twice as likely to experience a stroke compared to white women, and  50% more likely to have high blood pressure, according to the Office of Minority Health.
Strokes are more common in Black Americans than any other racial group in the U.S., the American Stroke Association says. Death rates are also higher.
Dr. Amber Johnson, a cardiologist and assistant professor of medicine at the University of Chicago, called the data in the study “alarming” but said she’s not surprised.
“I tend to see a lot of younger, Black women and there are higher rates of hypertension that I’m seeing,” Johnson said.
In the new study, which has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal, Aparicio and his colleagues looked at data from nearly 47,000 women in the Black Women’s Health Study, which has tracked the health of a huge group of Black women since 1995.
All of the women were stroke-free at the beginning of the study, and were followed for up to 23 years. The researchers looked at what age women developed high blood pressure — in this case, based on when they started treatment for it — and also looked at whether they had a stroke during the study period.
They found that compared to women who didn’t have high blood pressure, Black women who developed high blood pressure before 35 had 3.1 times the risk of having a stroke by middle age. Those who developed high blood pressure before 45 had 2.2 times the risk of stroke, and high blood pressure from ages 45 to 64 was tied to a 1.69 times higher risk of stroke.
A stroke is a “very devastating event” that can cause permanent damage to the brain and permanently alter a person’s speech and mobility, said Dr. Anais Hausvater, a cardiologist at NYU Langone Health in New York City. The study urges Black women to see their doctor and get their risk factors checked early, she said.
“A lot of people don’t go to see a doctor in their 30s because they’re presumed to be healthy,” Hausvater said. “They don’t feel any symptoms because hypertension is a silent disease. So, people often don’t know that they have hypertension.”
Johnson said that factors like underdiagnosis and a lack of treatment also put many Black women at risk of developing hypertension and stroke.
While lifestyle choices like diet and smoking can affect blood pressure, many patients may not recognize that hypertension can also be inherited, she said.
Experts said that lifestyle changes, like increasing physical exercise, limiting salt and eating healthy foods, can help decrease risk.
The sooner doctors treat hypertension, the sooner patients can lower their risk of stroke and heart disease, Hausvater said.
Screening for high blood pressure and controlling blood pressure levels are some of the prime elements for preventative care, “before people actually have a stroke,” Arapicio said.
“By the time somebody has a stroke, it’s too late,” he said.

2024-03-09T20:34:20.646Z,"After Brittany Mahomes' advice, doctors offer ways to ease pelvic floor problems",NBC News,"When Brittany Mahomes recently advised moms to take care of their pelvic floors, she raised awareness of a condition that is more common than many young women realize.
“Women don’t get educated about this, especially when they are younger, when they are of childbearing age,” said Dr. Deepanjana Das, a urogynecology and reconstructive pelvic surgery specialist at the Cleveland Clinic.
Earlier this week, Mahomes, who has two young children with her husband, Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, gave a reminder to women on her Instagram story: “Once you have kids take care of your pelvic floor. Seriously,” signing it “from a girl with a fractured back.”
NBC News has reached out to representatives for Mahomes for comment. Meanwhile, doctors say back and pelvic floor problems can be connected.
“Women can be at risk of both due to low-back issues and factors such as pregnancy and childbirth,” said Dr. Roger Dmochowski, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology, urology and surgery, and associate surgeon in chief at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
The gynecologic organs, the bladder and the rectum are all held in place by a group of muscles and ligaments known as the pelvic floor, Dmochowski explained. When these tissues are stretched and weakened, urinary and fecal incontinence can result. More severe issues with those muscles can lead to organ prolapse, during which one or more of the pelvic organs can drop down into the vaginal canal and even protrude through the vagina.
Other risk factors include repeated lifting of heavy weights and standing for many hours.
“Gravity is not your best friend,” Dmochowski said.
Overall, nearly a quarter of women in the U.S. develop pelvic floor issues, according to the National Institutes of Health. Younger women ages 20 to 39 are less likely to experience symptoms — less than 10%. About a quarter of women in their 40s and 50s have symptoms, although that percentage increases with age. More than a third of women ages 60 to 79, and half of those 80 or older, have pelvic floor problems.
Early signs of pelvic floor weakening can start with urinary symptoms.
“A sudden loss of urine that can be activity-related or an overactive bladder can be signs that the pelvic floor is acting up,” Dmochowski said. “Other women might develop new bowel symptoms, such as loss of control or new constipation.”
As the problem progresses, women might feel pressure as “either the rectum, the bladder or the uterus, or all three, bulge into the vagina,” Dmochowski said. “Women will sometimes describe this as feeling like a beach ball coming out of their vagina.”
Some women don’t notice any symptoms and the prolapse is discovered during their annual exam, Dmochowski said. Sometimes, women might not notice they are experiencing back problems until they come in with pelvic floor symptoms, he said.
Kegel exercises, when women tighten and relax the pelvic floor muscles, can help, especially among younger women.
“You can do this at a stoplight when driving,” Dmochowski said. “Imagine you’re urinating and then try to stop. You contract for a few seconds, and then relax for a few seconds. You want to repeatedly activate the muscles.”
Pelvic floor exercises are like lifting weights.
“By flexing and then relaxing them, you build volume and hopefully regain function,” Dmochowski said.
Dmochowski tells patients that once or twice a week isn’t enough.
“I draw the analogy to training for a road race or a marathon,” he explained. “There has to be some stick-to-itiveness.”
“The response rates are all over the place in the literature,” Dmochowski said, adding that the number might be as low as 20% recovery.
Another option is guided physical therapy to rehab the pelvic floor muscles, said Das.
“It’s been established that monitored physical therapy can help rehab those muscles after delivery,” she said. “We know it can play a huge role in helping women recover.”
Das recommends women get physical therapy soon after vaginal childbirth.
“In other countries, it’s a regular part of delivery to get physical therapy,” she said. “That’s not something we have in the U.S.,” except in cases where there was a difficult delivery.
Among the other options for women with pelvic floor issues is a pessary, a vaginal insert that works “like an internal crutch that holds everything in place,” Dmochowski said. “It’s something a woman is fitted for and then she determines whether she likes it or not. About 1 in 4 women in our practice uses them.”
Another option is surgery in which the pelvic floor is put back in place and is anchored there by attaching it to a knob of spinal bone, Dmochowski said.

2024-02-12T20:25:03.941Z,Swapping in a salt substitute may significantly lower risk of high blood pressure,NBC News,"People who lower the amount of salt in their diets by using a salt substitute may significantly decrease the risk of developing high blood pressure, a study published Monday suggests.
The report, in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, analyzed data from hundreds of men and women, ages 55 and older, who were in elder care facilities in China.
The data came from an earlier, larger study, called DECIDE-Salt, which included 1,612 participants. For the new analysis, researchers focused on 157 women and 454 men who had healthy blood pressure levels and were given food either with the usual amount of salt or with a salt substitute.
The researchers found that cutting salt back by more than a third by swapping in another mineral supplement — salty-tasting potassium chloride — along with other flavorings, such as mushroom, seaweed and lemon, was protective against high blood pressure over a two-year period.
Dr. Yangfeng Wu, senior author of the study and executive director of the Peking University Clinical Research Institute in Beijing, said that although the study was conducted in China, the findings should apply to people in other countries, including the U.S. Anyone can benefit from replacing salt with a substitute, whether they have high blood pressure or not, Wu said.
Uncontrolled high blood pressure can raise the risk for numerous chronic diseases, including heart and kidney disease, diabetes and dementia.
Most Americans consume too much salt, about 3,500 milligrams a day, according to the American Heart Association. Currently, the Food and Drug Administration recommends that healthy adults consume less than 2,300 mg of sodium (about a teaspoon of salt) per day.
Potassium chloride, which combines the essential supplement potassium with chloride, tastes and acts like table salt without adding harmful sodium to the diet. The recommended daily allowance of potassium for people 19 and older is 3,400 mg for men and 2,600 mg for women.
Earlier studies showed that salt substitutes could lower blood pressure — systolic, in particular — among people with hypertension, Wu said. “The present study extended the effect of salt substitutes to people with normal blood pressure,” Wu said.
Systolic — the top number in a blood pressure reading — indicates the amount of pressure in the arteries, when the heart contracts and pumps blood through the body. Diastolic — the bottom number — is the pressure in the arteries between heartbeats.
""High blood pressure is a leading contributor to deaths worldwide,” said Dr. Deepak Gupta, an associate professor of medicine in the division of cardiovascular medicine at the Vanderbilt Medical Center. “Diet is clearly a contributor,” he said.
Gupta, who was not involved in the study, said the salt substitute helped by lowering the amount of table salt, sodium chloride, consumed daily and adding in potassium.
“Americans in general have low potassium in their diets,” Gupta said. “Having a diet enriched in potassium, even if nothing is done on the sodium side, is likely to have an impact on lowering blood pressure.”
The new study used a particular type of substitute, but in the U.S., salt substitutes can be purchased that either completely or partially replace the salt.
It can be challenging for people to lower their salt intake long term unless they find a satisfying substitute, said Dr. George Dangas, a professor of medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine and chief of cardiology at Mount Sinai Queens, who was not involved in the new research.
“We live in a very salt-rich environment,” Dangas said. “We need to figure out how to make supplements that preserve the taste so they will enhance compliance with salt reduction.”
Before increasing potassium intake, people should talk to their doctors, Dangas warned. Some conditions, such as kidney disease, can lead to high potassium levels, and adding more of the mineral might be dangerous.
The overall message of the study is that “limiting salt in the diet can bring down blood pressure, which is all important to heart health,” said Dr. Michelle Bloom, system director of the cardio-oncology program at NYU Langone Health and a professor at the NYU Grossman Long Island School of Medicine.
""People need to be more cognizant of labels and to be really aware of what they are putting in their bodies,"" said Bloom, who was not involved with the study.
Even lowering blood pressure by a couple of points “can lead to a substantial decrease in the likelihood of heart attack, heart failure and stroke” Bloom said. “The typical American diet contains a lot of processed packaged food that has a lot of salt in it that people are often not aware of. There are other ways to satiate that part of a person’s appetite without salt, such as spices and lemon juice.”
CORRECTION (Feb. 12, 2024, 8:40 p.m. ET): An earlier version of this article mischaracterized the amount of daily sodium recommended by the FDA. Adults should consume less than 2,300 mg of salt per day, which is equal to about 1 teaspoon, not a half-teaspoon.

2024-03-06T22:40:15.039Z,Scientists found tiny nanoplastics in people’s arteries. Their presence was tied to a higher risk of heart disease.,NBC News,"People with microplastics and nanoplastics in plaque lining a major blood vessel in their neck may have a higher risk of heart attack, stroke or death, new research suggests.
The findings, published Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine, are the first time scientists have linked these tiny plastic particles, the result of degraded plastic pollution, to cardiovascular disease.
Microplastics are defined as particles smaller than 5 millimeters, and nanoplastics are far smaller — so tiny that they can be seen only with specialized microscopes. In recent years, their ubiquity has become undeniable: They have been found in fresh snowfall in Antarctica and at the depths of the Marianas Trench, as well as in human blood; breast milk; urine; and placental, lung and liver tissue.
Dr. Raffaele Marfella — a cardiology researcher in the University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli’s department of advanced medical and surgical sciences in Naples, Italy, and the lead author of the new study — said that he and his colleagues initiated the study to look for new risk factors for cardiovascular disease.
They knew of the enormous amount of degraded plastic pollution contaminating the planet and wondered “whether plastic, in the form of micro- or nanoplastics, could also degrade our arteries,” Marfella said in an email. People can inhale and ingest the plastic particles. The plastic can also enter the body through skin.
To study the effects, they turned to a group of patients already scheduled to undergo surgery for a condition called carotid artery stenosis, in which plaque, or fatty deposits, blocks normal blood flow. The body’s two carotid arteries supply blood to the brain, face and neck. The researchers looked at plaque removed from 257 patients and tracked the patients’ health for an average of 34 months following the surgery.
They found plastic particles — mostly nanoplastics — in the plaque of 150 patients. At follow-up, nonfatal heart attack, nonfatal stroke or death from any cause occurred in 20% of those patients and in 7.5% of the patients without detectable plastic particles.
After adjusting for age, sex, body mass index and health conditions such as diabetes and abnormal cholesterol, the patients with detectable levels of plastics had “nearly a five times greater risk of a cardiovascular event” than the other patients, Marfella said.
Numerous experimental studies on cells and in animals have shown that the presence of these plastic particles increases diseases. One study published online in February in the Journal of Hazardous Materials found microplastics, for the first time, in human arteries.
Previous studies finding the tiny particles in human tissue were “pioneering,” said Dick Vethaak, a biologist and toxicologist at Utrecht University’s Institute for Risk Assessment Sciences and coordinator of the Dutch Microplastics and Human Health Consortium, but this study “is the first of its kind.”
“It is the first one that looked at a large number of donors in so much detail” and the first to follow patients for years to track their health, said Vethaak, who wasn’t involved with the new study.
However, this kind of observational study can show only an association between the plastic particles and heart attack, stroke or death. It cannot show that they caused these cardiovascular events. For that, researchers would need to conduct a randomized, controlled trial, but it would be unethical to intentionally expose people to potential toxins.
Nevertheless, the study offers some hints about the relationship between the presence of micro- and nanoplastics and heart disease, said Dr. Martha Gulati, director of preventive cardiology in the Smidt Heart Institute at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles.
“We know that cardiovascular disease, particularly myocardial infarction, is usually triggered by an inflammatory response,” Gulati said, using another term for heart attack. The Italian researchers measured markers for inflammation in patients and found that those markers increased as the level of plastics in the plaque rose.
Still, “is the inflammation due to the nanoplastics or something else?” Gulati asked.
Because the study was carried out in a very specific group of patients, the results cannot be applied to the broader population. But it could pave the way for future studies.
“This paper might provoke people to figure out if we can measure micro- and nanoplastics in the general population and then examine who goes on to develop cardiac events,” Gulati said.
Vethaak said similar studies are in the pipeline for other kinds of human tissue.
The researchers also noted the possibility that the plaque samples could have been  contaminated in the lab.
“Future studies performed with the use of clean rooms, where there is no plastic in any form except the material under study, might corroborate our observations,” they wrote in the paper.
“I hope that this study, and more work that it triggers, helps us address our environment and cardiovascular health because I feel like this is something that really needs to be discussed,” Gulati said. “It gets very little attention.”

2024-02-28T16:00:40.000Z,What it's actually like to get measles,NBC News,"It starts with a high fever — in some cases, up to 105 degrees Fahrenheit. Children may also feel achy or lose energy.
Roughly a day after the fever sets in come the three C’s of measles: cough, conjunctivitis (pink eye) and coryza (a runny nose). Some kids may be sensitive to light and start to squint, as well.
But the most characteristic signs of measles — tiny white spots in the mouth and a blotchy rash that spreads from head to toe — don’t appear right away.
The spots typically show up on the insides of the cheeks near the molars about two to three days after symptoms start. The rash — which consists of flat, red spots — breaks out between days three and five, forming at the hairline before spreading to the neck, torso, arms, legs and feet.
“It’s as if you sort of poured a bucket of measles on your head, and then it works its way down,” said Dr. Paul Offit, who had measles as a child before vaccines were available. Offit is the director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.
Already this year, 35 measles cases have been recorded across 15 states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That puts the U.S. on track to surpass last year's total of 58.
The two biggest outbreaks have been in Florida — which recorded its 10th measles case over the weekend — and Pennsylvania, which identified nine cases over a monthlong period from December to January.
Around 1 to 3 out of every 1,000 children infected with measles die from respiratory and neurological complications. In rare cases, measles can also lead to blindness or long-term vision problems.
But many people may not be aware of its symptoms or severity, according to doctors who treat measles patients. And even for those who recover fully and quickly, the illness can be painful, Offit said: “If you look at children who have measles, they’re miserable.”
By the time the measles rash reaches the lower body, blotches on the head and the face begin to coalesce into a giant red patch, said Dr. Mark Kline, an infectious disease specialist at Children’s Hospital New Orleans.
“Usually the illness itself peaks during that phase,” Kline said. “Day four or five, the fever will be the highest, the child’s symptoms will be the most severe.”
Randy Blaser, 67, of Lake County, Illinois, said he had measles as a child in the 1960s.
“I had a pretty severe case of it,” Blaser said, though he wasn’t able to provide medical records from the time. He said he developed the characteristic rash and was sick for about a week.
“Most of what I remember is from what my mom told me about how I was getting delirious at one point. I had a really high fever, and she was freaking out,” Blaser said.
Shortly after the illness, he said, he had to get glasses for nearsightedness. Blaser suspects the two are linked, given the timing, though his doctors don't necessarily think so, he said.
“Of all the childhood diseases, that was the worst one,” he said.
There is no treatment for measles, so doctors focus on helping people manage their symptoms. If an unvaccinated person is exposed to measles and hasn't developed symptoms yet, a vaccine can ward off infection if it is administered within 72 hours. Another option is a preventive injection called immune globulin, which must be given within six days of exposure.
Measles symptoms typically last 10 days, assuming patients don’t have severe complications, like swelling of the brain, pneumonia or secondary bacterial infections.
For many, the rash slowly clears up over the sixth through ninth days, Kline said, but it may leave behind brown or peeling skin.
If a fever goes away and then comes back, Kline said, that could indicate a secondary infection. Symptoms like confusion, loss of consciousness, headaches, vomiting or seizures might be signs of a neurological issue, he added, which can sometimes result in deafness or intellectual disability.
Before the first measles vaccine became available in 1963, nearly all children got the disease by age 15. Around 3 million to 4 million people in the U.S. were infected every year, and 400 to 500 people died of measles annually.
Measles has been considered eradicated in the U.S. since 2000, but there have been occasional outbreaks since then, often originating in other countries.
The U.S. nearly lost its measles elimination status in 2019, when it recorded more than 1,200 cases — the most since 1992. The majority were related to ongoing transmission in large, close-knit Orthodox Jewish communities in New York.
In the two major outbreaks this year, measles spread at a children’s hospital and day care facility in Philadelphia and an elementary school in Florida. All nine patients in Broward County, Florida, are children, and two are 4 years old or younger. The state's 10th case is a person in their 20s in Polk County.
Meanwhile, Arizona reported two measles cases last week, and Louisiana recorded two in the New Orleans area.
Kline, who was involved in the care of the Louisiana patients, said both are children under 2 and neither required hospitalization.
But now that measles is relatively rare, he said, “the vast majority of doctors and nurses who are out there staffing ERs and clinics and on hospital floors these days have never seen a case.”
Several years ago, Kline said, he assisted with a patient who had a high fever and a rash after doctors struggled to find a diagnosis.
“I walked into the room, opened the door, and from across the room I said, ‘That’s measles,’” Kline said. “The child had been in the hospital for two or three days already, exposing people.”
Most people who get measles are unvaccinated. Two shots are 97% effective, according to the CDC.
Children in the U.S. should get their first doses between 12 and 15 months and their second between 4 and 6 years old.
For nearly 10 years, 95% of U.S. kindergartners had received both doses. But the rate fell to 93% in the 2022–23 school year — which is likely to explain why the country has had so many cases in the last two months, doctors said.
“In order to prevent any pandemic or epidemic for measles, you really have to have an immunization rate of 95%,” said Dr. Samir Midani, the division chief of pediatric infectious diseases and immunology at Nemours Children’s Health in Jacksonville, Florida.
In the Broward County School District, where Florida's current outbreak is, 91.7% of students in the 2021-22 academic year had received all their required vaccines, including measles shots. However, 97% of students at Manatee Bay Elementary, where the outbreak began, have received at least one dose of the measles vaccine, according to the Florida Department of Health.
“Vaccinated people may get it, but really the effectiveness of the vaccine is very high,” Midani said. “I would worry about somebody who is not immunized.”

2024-01-24T17:32:31.947Z,A rare fungal infection is popping up in an unexpected part of the U.S.,NBC News,"A rare fungal infection thought to mainly occur in the northern Midwest and parts of the Southeast is more common in other parts of the U.S. than expected, new research published Wednesday finds.
The illness, called blastomycosis, can be difficult to diagnose, in part because it can resemble other respiratory infections. And the longer it goes undiagnosed, the more difficult it is to treat.
The infection is caused by a fungus called Blastomyces dermatitidis, which thrives in wet soil and decaying logs and leaves. Blastomycosis is considered an “endemic mycosis” — a type of fungal disease that only occurs in a particular geographic area.
While it’s well known in areas around the Great Lakes, the Ohio River valley and the Mississippi River valley, it’s a bit more surprising for the infection to pop up in Vermont, but that’s exactly what was found in the new study, published in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Emerging Infectious Diseases journal.
“Vermont is not generally an area you think of when you talk about blastomycosis,” said Dr. Arturo Casadevall, chair of molecular microbiology and immunology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. But “there have been several papers recently suggesting that fungal infections are on the move across the country and this is one of them.”
Dr. Brian Borah, medical director for Vaccine-Preventable Diseases Surveillance at the Chicago Department of Public Health, who led the study, said, “It’s a big question whether we were able to detect cases that were unknown to us previously, or if we are detecting an increase in cases.”
The epidemiology of other fungal diseases nationwide has been changing, however, Borah said, adding, “I don’t think blastomycosis would be immune from those patterns.”
Blastomycosis is rare, and can cause respiratory symptoms, fever and body aches in about half of the people who are infected from inhaling the Blastomyces spores. Most cases are mild, but if left untreated, blastomycosis can cause serious illness or death.
“One of the great problems with fungal diseases is that they are unreportable,” meaning public health departments don’t require doctors to report cases of the illness they see to the state, said Casadevall, who was not involved with the new study.
Only five states — Arkansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin — have public health surveillance for blastomycosis. That means the prevalence of the disease outside these states is unknown.
Borah, who was previously a CDC epidemic intelligence service officer assigned to the Vermont Department of Health, said that there had been some reports of blastomycosis cases in the Northeast, including from a couple of studies as well as anecdotal reports from doctors and veterinarians in Vermont.
Without public surveillance, Borah and his team turned to health insurance claims to determine how many patients were treated for blastomycosis in Vermont from 2011 through 2020.
The data included all claims from Medicare and Medicaid recipients in the state and about 75% of Vermont residents who had other health insurance. They identified 114 cases during the 10-year period, and 30% required hospitalization. With an average rate of 1.8 cases per 100,000 people every year, Vermont had higher rates of blastomycosis than all but one of the states that have surveillance for the disease, the study found. Wisconsin, the state with the highest rate of blastomycosis, has an average of 2.1 cases per 100,000 people.
A study published in 2022 suggested that around 10% of illnesses caused by fungal infections were diagnosed outside regions where the fungi are known to be endemic.
There are a number of things that could be happening, said Dr. Bruce Klein, a professor of pediatrics, medicine and medical microbiology and immunology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. These pathogens can hitch a ride on shoes when people travel. New developments can stir soil — and the fungi they harbor  — releasing spores into the air in places they weren’t thought to exist.
“Blastomyces dermatitidis grows as a mold and the mold produces spores. When those spores are physically disturbed, they become aerosolized and are breathed into the lungs,”Klein said, adding that wind and rain, not just human intervention, can cause the spores to become airborne.
Recent studies have shown that climate change is also expanding the ranges of fungi that can make people sick. Human-driven climate change is shifting rain patterns, increasing drought in some regions — an environment that favors fungi including Coccidioides, which causes Valley fever — while causing more flooding and humidity in others.
Rising temperatures and extreme weather events including storms, flooding, drought and hurricanes, impact soils and can redistribute fungi, said Asiya Gusa, an assistant professor of molecular genetics and microbiology at Duke University who studies how fungi adapt to heat stress.
“That is going to increase our human exposure to fungi and also expose those fungi to higher temperatures,” she said. “There’s a fear that with increased humidity and warm, damp weather, we could see a larger accumulation of spores.”
Early studies have suggested that heat could put stress on fungi that thus far have not been able to withstand body heat, to evolve to be able to survive in the human body.
“Climate change is the 800-pound gorilla in the room,” Casadevall said. “That could change a lot of the epidemiology of these diseases.”
Once Blastomyces dermatitidis spores enter the lungs, a person’s body heat triggers a shape-shifting transformation. The spores morph into yeast cells protected by thick armor, which is one reason fungal infections can be so difficult to treat, Klein said.
Another reason is that fungal cells are much more like human cells than plant cells or bacterial cells, which makes it difficult to develop drugs that can attack and kill fungi without also damaging human cells, he said.
Fungal infections are most concerning for people who are immunocompromised, and most serious fungal infections occur in this population. But blastomycosis usually occurs in otherwise healthy people, Klein said.
“This is a remarkable distinction from many other fungi that are more feeble and prey on people whose immune systems are impaired by things like biologics,” he said, noting that two other fungal diseases — Valley fever and histoplasmosis, which are also found in specific regions in the U.S., also behave like this.
There is likely a dose-response, meaning the more spores a person breathes in, the greater chance they have of getting sick. The fungus is usually found in small pockets, often in damp woods, meaning people are not exposed to it all the time, Klein said.
Most blastomycosis cases are mild. About 95% are fully treatable with antifungals, but it can take up to a year to clear an infection that’s spread outside the lungs, Klein said.
The difficult thing is that fungal infections often look like other illnesses and can go undetected for weeks or months. This is especially true in places where fungal infections including blastomycosis and Valley fever aren’t thought to occur.
“Most commonly, these infections can look like garden-variety pneumonia or another respiratory illness,” Klein said. “These are more common than blastomycosis, so people are usually treated first for these other problems and they can see a physician, once, twice, three times, getting different courses of antibiotics while the fungal infection progresses.”

2024-02-23T00:20:15.210Z,Three Alabama clinics pause IVF services after court rules that embryos are children,NBC News,"Less than a week after the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that embryos created through in vitro fertilization are considered children, three IVF providers in the state have suspended services as they consider the legal repercussions of the decision.
The University of Alabama at Birmingham was first to announce the change on Wednesday. Then another practice, Alabama Fertility, posted a statement Thursday on social media saying it would put a hold on IVF treatments. The Center for Reproductive Medicine at Mobile Infirmary — the clinic sued in the court case — said Thursday that it would pause IVF procedures starting Saturday.
“We understand the burden this places on deserving families who want to bring babies into this world,” said Mark Nix, CEO of Infirmary Health, the system that includes Mobile Infirmary.
In its statement, Alabama Fertility said it was trying to find solutions for affected patients and ""working as hard as we can to alert our legislators as to the far reaching negative impact of this ruling on the women of Alabama.""
Hannah Echols, a spokesperson for UAB, said that health system will continue to offer egg retrieval but will no longer fertilize eggs or develop embryos.
""We are saddened that this will impact our patients’ attempt to have a baby through IVF, but we must evaluate the potential that our patients and our physicians could be prosecuted criminally or face punitive damages for following the standard of care for IVF treatments,"" Echols said in a statement.
The practice of IVF involves combining sperm and eggs in a lab to create embryos, then implanting one or more of those embryos in a person’s uterus. Extra embryos are often frozen and stored; however, embryos are also frequently discarded if they have genetic abnormalities or if patients do not need to use them.
Because of the Alabama Supreme Court ruling, IVF providers now fear they or their patients could face legal penalties if they discard any embryos.
However, many questions remain about the ruling's implications. The judges' decision came in response to a unique case in which a person wandered into an unlocked storage area at Mobile Infirmary in Mobile, Alabama, and dropped several frozen embryos on the floor.
The court determined on Feb. 16 that the clinic's failure to secure that storage area violated the state’s Wrongful Death Act — which says an unjustified or negligent act that leads to someone’s death is a civil offense — because the frozen embryos were considered human beings.
Meghan Cole, a patient at Alabama Fertility, has a rare blood disorder that prevents her from safely carrying children, so she had been planning to start a family through IVF and surrogacy. The surrogate set to carry Cole's baby was supposed to receive an embryo implantation on Friday.
But last night, Cole's doctor called to tell her the implantation appointment had been canceled. Now she doesn't know when she'll be able to use her embryos.
""I thought it was going to be one of the best days of our lives tomorrow, and now we’re just devastated,"" she said.
However, other fertility practices in the state continue to offer IVF, hoping the legal confusion will resolve in their favor soon.
""We're not pausing our IVF services. I don't see a reasonable need to do that,"" said Dr. Brett Davenport, a reproductive endocrinologist at Fertility Institute of North Alabama.
""I have been working hard on adjusting our consent forms so that we can have a discussion with the patients who are now going through IVF or about to have an embryo transfer to where they now are aware of this law, they're aware of the implications,"" he added.
Huntsville Reproductive Medicine said it was proceeding with IVF treatments, as well, but that it does not plan to discard any frozen embryos for the time being without a notary-signed consent from patients. Before the Alabama ruling, the clinic was set to discard several batches of frozen embryos that had been abandoned, it said — some of which were from 16 years ago.
Gail Deady, senior staff attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights, said the Alabama ruling suggests IVF providers could face civil — not criminal — penalties in some situations, meaning they’d have to pay damages.
The Medical Association of Alabama on Wednesday called on the Alabama Supreme Court to reconsider or suspend its ruling so that residents can have continued access to IVF.
It said the ruling, and UAB's subsequent decision to suspend IVF treatments, “will likely lead to fewer babies — children, grandchildren, nieces, nephews, and cousins — as fertility options become limited for those who want to have a family.”
RESOLVE: The National Infertility Association called the ruling cruel and said UAB had been “forced to make an impossible decision: pause IVF procedures for those hoping to build their families or put their patients and doctors at risk of prosecution.”
In 2021, more than 97,000 infants were born in the U.S. using assisted reproductive technology, which includes IVF. Globally, IVF results in more than 500,000 deliveries per year.

2024-03-07T16:48:21.247Z,FDA warns about lead contamination in more cinnamon products in the U.S.,NBC News,"The Food and Drug Administration said in a safety warning Wednesday that it identified additional cinnamon products in the U.S. that are contaminated with lead.
The ground cinnamon products found to contain lead are: La Fiesta, from La Superior SuperMercados; Marcum, from Save A Lot; MK, from SF Supermarket; Swad, from Patel Brothers; Supreme Tradition, from Dollar Tree & Family Dollar; and Eli Chilar, from La Joya Morelense.
In a statement, a spokesperson for Dollar Tree said it has removed all Supreme Tradition ground cinnamon products from its stores nationwide.
""We take this situation very seriously,"" the spokesperson said. The other retailers didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.
People shouldn’t eat, sell or serve the ground cinnamon products and should throw them out, the FDA said. The products have a long shelf life, it noted.
No illnesses or adverse events have been reported.
An analysis by the FDA found the six products had elevated lead levels from 2.03 to 3.4 parts per million. The FDA has set limits for lead levels only in certain foods; spices aren't among them. The United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization has a proposed international safety standard of 2.5 parts per million for spices that include cinnamon.
Lead exposure can be harmful to both children and adults, but high levels of lead can be especially dangerous for children, potentially leading to serious health issues, such as learning and behavior problems and lower IQs, the FDA said. Other problems can include damage to the brain and the nervous system and issues with hearing and speech, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The warning comes after the recall of lead-contaminated cinnamon applesauce pouches from the Florida-based company WanaBana USA. The CDC said that as of Feb. 23, it had received 468 reports of confirmed, suspected and probable cases of lead poisoning linked to the pouches from 44 states. Many of the people sickened were young children.
The agency has said cinnamon was the most likely source of the lead contamination in the applesauce pouches. After that recall, the FDA set out to sample ground cinnamon products from discount stores for lead contamination.
An FDA spokesperson told NBC News Thursday that the agency had no reason to suspect the cinnamon in the products in the new safety warning is the same cinnamon that was found in the WanaBana pouches.
That ground cinnamon, which was supplied by the Ecuadorian company Negasmart, contained far higher lead levels, from 2,270 ppm to 5,110 ppm, the spokesperson said.
Brian Ronholm, the director of food policy for Consumer Reports, a nonprofit group that researches the safety of the food system, called the FDA's warning ""alarming.""
""It demonstrates that the problem is more pervasive than we might believe,"" he said.

2024-01-24T18:21:18.633Z,FDA issues new warning about supplements containing tianeptine,NBC News,"The Food and Drug Administration issued a new warning late Tuesday about supplements that contain the ingredient tianeptine, commonly known as ""gas station heroin."" The products — sold under the name Neptune’s Fix and often found at gas stations, convenience stores and online — are linked to serious side effects including seizures, loss of consciousness and death.
The FDA, which first warned about the tianeptine-containing products in November, said it is still receiving reports of people being poisoned by the supplements.
Tianeptine is an antidepressant that is approved in some European, Asian and Latin American countries, but not in the United States.
The substance can cause side effects in the nervous system, heart and stomach, with some effects mimicking opioid toxicity and withdrawal, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The product can be found illegally in the U.S. as a dietary supplement and is often marketed by retailers as a way “to improve brain function and treat anxiety, depression, pain, opioid use disorder and other conditions,” according to the FDA.
In November, the FDA said it was investigating reports of serious reactions, including seizures and loss of consciousness leading to hospitalization.
“These products may interact, in life-threatening ways, with other medications a consumer may be taking,” the FDA said in a statement. “The agency is actively investigating adverse event reports in conjunction with local and state health departments.”
Dr. Pieter Cohen, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School who studies the regulation of supplements, said the illegal sale of tianeptine “is testament to the broken system.”
Dietary supplements sold in the U.S. aren’t approved by the FDA nor are they reviewed by the agency for their safety and effectiveness.
The FDA's ""tools are extremely limited,"" Cohen said. ""They're basically in a situation where they need to ask the company politely if they can take if off the market.""
The agency said Tuesday that Neptune Resources, the maker of Neptune’s Fix, agreed to voluntarily recall its products, which include Neptune’s Fix Elixir, Neptune’s Fix Extra Strength Elixir and Neptune’s Fix Tablets.
It’s unclear whether the products can still be found on store shelves. The FDA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
However, the FDA said that at least 12 states have banned the sale of tianeptine.
Additionally, the agency sent a letter to convenience stores, gas stations and other retailers on Jan. 11 urging them to stop selling Neptune’s Fix and any other tianeptine-containing products.
The FDA's warning comes less than a week after House lawmakers called on the FDA commissioner, Dr. Robert Califf, to crack down on the use of tianeptine.

2024-02-21T02:04:35.921Z,Doctors and patients fearfully proceed with IVF after Alabama court rules embryos are children,NBC News,"After three miscarriages in less than a year, Gabby Goidel said she was diagnosed with unexplained genetic infertility.
For reasons that aren't clear to doctors, any fetus she carries has a higher-than-average likelihood of genetic abnormalities, she said, so there is a slim chance she'd be able to carry a pregnancy to term without in-vitro fertilization.
To avoid the possibility of additional miscarriages, Goidel and her husband, Spencer, decided last year to pursue in vitro fertilization in their home state of Alabama.
IVF allows doctors to test embryos for genetic abnormalities, then implant only the ones that are healthy.
The Goidels were on track to freeze embryos later this month, and they planned to only store the ones that were genetically normal.
But on Friday, the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos created through IVF are considered children under state law, meaning that people could theoretically be sued for destroying an embryo.
The Goidels began to worry whether they might be forced to store — or even use — embryos they had intended to discard.
""Most of our embryos are not going to be genetically normal,"" said Goidel, a 26-year-old property manager in Auburn. ""My hope would be that we could let those embryos naturally pass, but now it’s, 'Do we have to save them?' I don’t necessarily want to implant a child that I know is going to miscarry.""
Roughly half of first-trimester miscarriages are due to a chromosomal abnormality in the fetus. In addition to vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain and cramping, miscarriages can increase the risk of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and suicide.
In the wake of the Alabama ruling, many patients and providers are unsure of how to navigate the IVF process, given that embryos are often discarded if they have genetic abnormalities or after patients decide they will not need to use them. The decision raises questions about whether those who undergo IVF will have to store all their embryos indefinitely — but experts said the answer is not yet clear.
Storing frozen embryos can cost between $350 to $1,000 per year.
The court's decision was issued in a case in which a person removed embryos from storage at a fertility clinic and dropped them on the floor accidentally.
Gail Deady, senior staff attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights, said that because of that, the ruling ""does not appear to create criminal liability for IVF providers.""
Instead, she said, ""what it does implicate is the Wrongful Death Act, which is civil liability and negligence,"" meaning people could be sued for the destruction of embryos and have to pay monetary penalties.
Nevertheless, “anyone who cares about reproductive autonomy should be terrified of this decision,” Deady added.
Dr. Mamie McLean, a reproductive endocrinologist at Alabama Fertility, said she is concerned about the survival of IVF services in Alabama. Clinics may need to raise prices if they have trouble staffing providers or have to pay more for medical malpractice insurance, she said. As a result, fewer people may be able to afford IVF and fewer insurers may be willing to cover treatments.
The cost of insurance to defend against wrongful death lawsuits “might actually prevent us from practicing, it would be so high,” said Dr. Brett Davenport, a reproductive endocrinologist at Fertility Institute of North Alabama.
Davenport, too, worries the new law could penalize doctors for helping people start families.
“I am a very pro-life reproductive endocrinologist, and yet this still seems quite absurd to me,” he said.
Legal experts worry the ruling could set the stage for harsher abortion restrictions in the future, as well, such as penalties for women who get abortions. (Right now, state law only penalizes providers who administer abortions.)
""The next step will be to say, 'Well, if an embryo is a person [outside the uterus], clearly it's a person in utero,"" said Priscilla Smith, director of the Program for the Study of Reproductive Justice at Yale Law School.
“I don’t want to be dramatic and say it’s totally Handmaid’s Tale, but more and more, you’re in the situation rather where the state controls your behavior,"" Smith said.
After the Alabama Supreme Court decision, Meghan Cole, an attorney in Birmingham, made a plan to move her remaining embryos to another state. Cole has a rare blood disorder that prevents her from safely carrying a child, so she’s planning to use a surrogate. That embryo transfer is scheduled for next week, and she still has other embryos in storage.
“I was scared for what the future held for the embryos that we’re still going to have in storage,” she said. “My first thought was, ‘OK, I need to transfer my embryos out-of-state and have them frozen somewhere else so I don’t open myself up to liability.’”
Cole said she selected which embryo to use with Alabama’s legal landscape in mind.
“We are picking a boy to transfer because these rules and laws that are coming out that are affecting women’s health kind of scare me for a daughter,” she said.
Deady said there's no reason yet why patients in Alabama should be afraid of getting IVF — but providers are proceeding cautiously.
McLean said there are even some concerns about the ability to freeze embryos in the first place, given the ruling. An alternative to freezing or discarding embryos, she said, would be to create fewer of them. But in that case, patients would likely require more rounds of IVF to get pregnant, which is both expensive and physically demanding.
Alabama's legal landscape has made the Goidels reconsider whether they want to raise kids there.
“We’re this very traditional family that just wants to have a kid, so I didn’t realize ever that this was going to be a question of morality,” Goidel said.
“We really envisioned starting a life here and probably retiring here,” she added. “We’re very much questioning whether or not we want to leave.”

2024-02-19T12:00:41.000Z,Black people have the highest rates of death from heart disease. Could more Black cardiologists help?,NBC News,"For Elston Harris, heart attacks seem to be a generational curse.
Several men from his father’s side of the family — including Harris’ uncles — died from heart attacks. Harris, who is 59 and a former college basketball player, almost experienced a similar fate after his own heart attack in 2017. The only signs he was having a heart attack that he noticed were “small” symptoms of back pain and trapped gas.
For Harris, the curse may have been a blessing in disguise: While being treated at Advocate Trinity Hospital, a medical center in southeast Chicago, he was referred to Dr. Marlon Everett, a cardiologist who gave him a “game plan” to follow. This included putting God first, eating healthy and concentrating on his checkups. But aside from Everett’s expertise, Harris said he felt comfortable because Everett looked like him.
“When you are African American or Black, you’re more comfortable interacting with someone who knows, ‘OK, he might have grew up here, or he might eat this, or I heard them do that,’” said Harris, who lives in Chicago. “So, you’re a lot more comfortable with people who walk in similar footsteps.”
Around 60% of Black American adults have heart disease, and heart disease death rates are highest among Black Americans compared to other racial and ethnic groups, according to the American Heart Association.
Yet Harris’ experience of having a cardiologist who looks like him is a rarity. A 2021 report by the Association of American Medical Colleges found that only 4.2% of cardiologists are Black. An earlier study, published in 2019 in the journal JAMA Cardiology had similar findings, revealing that Black doctors made up only 3% of the cardiologist workforce. That same report found that 51% of cardiologists were white and 19% were Asian.
Increasing the number of Black cardiologists could mean better heart health for Black patients.
“Underrepresented medical professionals are more likely to practice in their communities where cultural sensitivity can create trust and their presence have been shown to improve outcomes,” the AHA said in a statement to NBC News. “This connection is particularly important among Black Americans when it comes to heart health.”
Dr. Mary Branch, a cardiologist based in Greensboro, North Carolina, said she first became interested in cardiology nearly 20 years ago, after shadowing a white interventional cardiologist who was “very accepting of me,” she said. The path to cardiology is onerous, and includes four years of medical school, three years of internal medicine residency and three years of a cardiology fellowship, in addition to several board exams, she said, which can be a difficult path to follow.
Branch, a fourth-generation physician, said her path also included financial strain and discrimination — hurdles that are all too common for Black medical students and among the reasons, she said, why there are so few Black doctors in cardiology.
Branch was the first Black woman to enter the cardiovascular disease fellowship at the Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. At one point during her fellowship, she said, she lived in a hotel while trying to find secure housing.
Even without a place to stay, Branch said she was “still showing up” at her fellowship. “Really, it was just God saying you’re needed,” she said. “So, we got to keep going. But that meant a lot of hard choices.”
Many Black medical students can also experience harsh microaggressions, which can prevent them from becoming a cardiologist, Branch said.
The margin of error can be “very small” for Black trainees, she said. While most medical students and residents of all races perceived high levels of mistreatment, Black people perceived more stress in medical school than white people, according to a 2006 study in the Journal of the National Medical Association. The perceived stress stemmed from their minority status and experiences of racial discrimination in training.
A 2021 study in the Journal of General Internal Medicine found that the proportion of Black doctors in the U.S. had increased by only 4 percentage points over the last 120 years. The study also found that the share of Black male doctors remained the same since 1940. While there’s little data on the rates of Black women in cardiology, Black women make up only 2.8% of the physician workforce, according to a 2021 perspective in The Lancet.
Everett, who is a member of the Association of Black Cardiologists, a national organization bringing attention to the harmful impact of heart disease on Black people, cited a lack of adequate training programs for doctors who want to be cardiologists. Most cardiology programs may only have three or four cardiology training positions, but “we’re just not getting those training positions,” he said.
“Until there are programs that are mandating that there’s diversity in training programs, we’re never going to have a lot of inclusivity, especially in the sought-out training programs … such as cardiology,” Everett added.
The organization also plays a role in recruiting Black patients for clinical trials, which have low numbers of Black participants. A 2021 study published in the Journal of the American Heart Association found that Black adults were underrepresented in cardiovascular trials funded by the National Institutes of Health.
That can mean that doctors don’t have the best available information on how to treat Black patients.
“It’s very important to have a lot of Black patients in trials, so we can get better data — and more data means better information, and hopefully better outcomes,” Everett said.
For many Black patients, having a Black cardiologist creates feelings of trust and comfort, which is sometimes a challenge due to the medical system’s history of racism and mistreatment toward Black patients.
Nikita Oxner first saw Branch last year after doctors discovered she had a heart murmur that they detected during a sleep study. Oxner, 45, said up until that point, she had never sought care from a cardiologist, and even being referred to one was “scary.” Yet her fears subsided when she met Branch.
Under Branch’s care, Oxner discovered she had a condition that makes it difficult for the heart to pump blood.
Heart-related problems run in Oxner’s family. In 2019, hypertension led to her brother’s sudden death at age 31, and her grandmother died from heart disease at age 77. Her father, who died from cancer at age 39, “had hypertension, high blood pressure a majority of his life,” she said.
Oxner said that when she shared details about her brother and other family members to Branch, “she instantly understood.” While she “didn’t feel good” about having surgery to insert a defibrillator in her heart, Oxner trusted her doctor’s opinion.
“She had a lot of compassion,” said Oxner, who lives in Greensboro, North Carolina. “She was very understanding, down to earth and relatable — and really helped me understand how this could change my life.”
As a Black woman who often has to advocate for her health, Oxner said the fact that Branch was also a Black woman “mattered to me.”
Branch said the added layer of trust and comfort often seen between a Black patient and Black doctor can help motivate patients to stay on their heart medications and stick with healthy lifestyle changes.
For example, “hypertension is a big thing in our community,” she said. A Black cardiologist may also be on hypertension medication, she said, “so, they can relate and connect in that way.”
Like Oxner, Kia Smith, 42, is another Black woman who sought cardiac care from a Black physician. Smith, who lives in Ellenwood, Georgia, said she saw Dr. Camille Nelson, a cardiologist at Atlanta Heart Associates, in 2020 after experiencing an elevated heart rate. Smith said she believes that if she had chosen a non-Black cardiologist, she may have been treated like “a dramatic walk-in” and had her symptoms dismissed.
“At every turn, when I was concerned, she did not dismiss my concerns or my personal experiences,” Smith said of Nelson. “She also explained the science of everything to me, and we were able to get to a place where I was confident that I was going to be OK.” Nelson said that Smith’s symptoms may have stemmed from stress and recommended workout routines to get her heart into a healthier state.
Dr. Zainab Mahmoud, a cardiologist and instructor of medicine at Washington University in St. Louis, said many Black women tell her that they feel heard and understood under her care. Having a provider who can understand a Black patient’s experiences “creates this kind of trust and improves a patient-provider relationship,” she said.
“They’re more likely to then have their family members come or their family and friends come to see me as well,” Mahmoud added. “I’ve seen that happen multiple times I can’t even count.”
Increasing the number of Black cardiologists has been the focus of major health organizations in recent years.
The AHA’s scholars program provides cardiology resources for Black students from historically Black colleges and universities, where more than 70% of Black medical professionals earn their degrees.
The organization is also focusing on broader efforts: A strong education can help grow the next generation of Black doctors, nurses and researchers, it said in a statement. One major goal is to increase the number of Black students in graduate science, research and public health programs.
Like the AHA, the American College of Cardiology also implemented diversity efforts through its internal medicine program to introduce Black, Latino and other underrepresented groups into cardiology.
“The problem is, it’s not just cardiology,” said Dr. Melvin Echols, the ACC’s chief diversity, equity and inclusion officer. “It’s all of health care. You see a significant, very low rate of African American doctors. I think what we’re trying to do is make it easier, No. 1, for people to actually get information and get resources.”
Harris, who survived his 2017 heart attack, said it was “through God’s grace” that he ended up at Advocate Trinity Hospital when his life was on the line — with a cardiologist he could trust.
“He was there during my episode and we immediately formed a relationship after that,” Harris said of his cardiologist Everett. Harris has been under his care “ever since.”

2024-03-13T21:20:15.385Z,"A new way to screen for colon cancer may be on the horizon, study suggests",NBC News,"The first blood test to screen for colorectal cancer could be approved this year — raising the potential to drastically increase the number of people diagnosed with the second-highest cause of cancer death in the United States.
The test would not replace the gold-standard colonoscopy, experts said, but could boost the dismal rate of colorectal screenings with a less invasive and perhaps more palatable way to detect colon cancer.
Colonoscopies and “stool-based tests have that kind of ‘ick’ factor related to them,” said Dr. William Grady, a gastroenterologist at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle. “We need to find tests that people are going to use.”
Grady led the new research published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine that found that a blood test called Shield from California-based Guardant Health was, overall, 83% effective in finding colorectal cancers.
That’s significant, said outside experts.
“We’ve been anticipating and waiting excitedly for a blood-based test for colon cancer,” said Dr. Aasma Shaukat, a gastroenterologist at NYU Langone Health. It’s been “a long time coming.”
Colonoscopy is, by far, the most accurate and earliest way to detect cancers of the colon and rectum, as well as spots that may become cancer in the future. During the procedure, doctors go into the rectum with cameras in search of tumors and lesions that have the potential to become tumors if left alone.
Colon cancer screening is generally recommended starting at age 45, but less than 60% of people who are eligible are up to date.
“In an ideal world, everyone goes to get a first colonoscopy at 45. That’s not gonna happen,” said Dr. Tiago Biachi, a gastrointestinal oncologist at Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Florida. Neither Biachi nor Shaukat were involved with the Guardant research.
Cue the ""ick"" factor, as Grady described it, as well as a number of other logistical barriers.
The day before a colonoscopy, patients must take laxatives to clear out their colon for cameras to get the best view. That is, they are stuck in a bathroom for several hours.
Patients usually need to take a day off of work for the actual procedure, and, because of the anesthesia that’s involved, they need someone else to drive them home afterward.
“The blood-based test doesn’t have any of those issues,” Grady said.
Guardant’s blood test works by detecting DNA released by cancerous tumors. It's most effective in finding later stage cancers.
A positive test isn't a diagnosis on its own and would need a colonoscopy as a follow-up. Only a colonoscopy can tell doctors where tumors are located in the colon, or guide treatment.
The location of colorectal tumors can determine whether patients need surgery, or chemotherapy and radiation before surgery, Biachi said. ""This blood test is not a home run for cancer diagnosis.""
The Shield test was much less effective in detecting the earliest signs of colorectal cancer, when it’s most treatable. The test only found 13% percent of earlier stage polyps. That makes sense, considering that the test works by detecting tumor DNA. Precancerous polyps don't release such DNA.
It could be a sticking point for doctors.
""Do I really want to tell a patient that, if this test is positive, I’ll be able to for sure detect a more advanced cancer, but I’m not so sure how well it does for precursor polyps or early cancer?"" said Shaukat. ""Those are the lesions that we’re really looking for where we can actually make a difference.""
The Food and Drug Administration is expected to consider the Shield blood test for approval sometime this year, according to Guardant Health.
If approved, the blood test would be given every three years, starting at age 45. People with symptoms of colon cancer, such as rectal bleeding, or a family history of the disease, would still need a colonoscopy.

2024-02-08T15:01:41.536Z,"Biden administration cracks down on air pollution, citing links to deadly illnesses",NBC News,"The Biden administration on Wednesday announced a new air quality standard that aims to prevent deadly illnesses linked to pollutants.
The standard cracks down on fine particulate matter — tiny particles in the air that can penetrate deep into the lungs. Much of this pollution in the air comes from the combustion of gasoline, oil, diesel fuel or wood, usually from sources such as factories, power plants, vehicles, wildfires or fireplaces.
The Environmental Protection Agency said Wednesday that “a broad and growing body of science” links particulate matter to serious and sometimes fatal illnesses.
Long-term exposure can increase the risk of heart disease, lung cancer and chronic kidney disease, and may also be associated with an increased risk of neurological disorders. Short-term exposure can increase the risk of cardiac arrest, asthma attacks or stroke. Both types of exposure are directly linked to hospitalizations and deaths.
“It’s very clear that particulate matter kills people and makes people sick,” said Laura Kate Bender, assistant vice president for healthy air at the American Lung Association. “We’ve also seen over time that particulate matter is more dangerous at lower levels than was previously realized.”
Before Wednesday, the EPA said that the annual concentration of particulate matter within a state should not exceed 12 micrograms per cubic meter, calculated as an average over three years. The American Lung Association and other health organizations have pushed to lower that limit to 8 micrograms per cubic meter.
The EPA’s new standard is close to that target: It sets an annual threshold of 9 micrograms per cubic meter.
“It is a substantial change, a meaningful change. It’s definitely a victory for public health,” said Francesca Dominici, a data scientist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
Lowering the threshold even further would have a greater health benefit, she said, “but considering where we are right now, I think it’s definitely a big step in the right direction.”
Bender said the new standard is “not as strong as the Lung Association had called for, but nevertheless, it’s going to save a lot of lives.”
The EPA estimated that the new standard would prevent up to 4,500 premature deaths in the first year once states are fully compliant in 2032.
Dominici said the 4,500 estimate is based, in part, on her own research: Her 2020 study found that lowering the air quality standard to 10 micrograms per cubic meter would save more than 143,000 lives over a decade.
The EPA also estimated that the new standard will yield up to $46 billion in health benefits, such as avoiding lost workdays and preventing emergency department visits.
Bender said that figure is likely an undercount. ""When it comes to all of the health impacts of particle pollution, there’s not always a way to monetize it or to put a number on it,"" she said.
Scientists are still uncovering negative health effects of air pollution. Emerging evidence suggests that exposure to particulate matter might impair cognitive function or accelerate cognitive decline. And a study last year found that higher exposure to air pollutants during pregnancy might negatively impact a child’s neurodevelopment after birth.
The EPA said in an analysis Wednesday that states likely won’t need to meet the new air quality standard until 2032, since it takes time to implement changes to lower pollution levels. But according to Dominici, “there’s going to be much more pressure to try to comply with the new standard much sooner than that.”
Bender said the EPA will work with states to determine which counties are not meeting the new standard, then develop cleanup plans that states can implement.
“It’s a long process, but it works,” she said. “We’ve seen it work over the years as communities have ratcheted down on harmful levels of pollution.”
Right now, the EPA predicts that 52 counties in the United States  won’t meet the new standard by 2032. Of them, 23 counties are in California. The list includes Los Angeles, San Diego and Sacramento.
Bender said California has faced ""really significant air pollution challenges compared to the rest of the country.” California cities dominated the American Lung Association’s rankings last year of the most polluted metropolitan areas in the U.S.
Wildfire smoke and traffic pollution are likely the main contributors to the problem, Dominici said.
“Because of climate change, wildfires are becoming more extreme and more frequent,"" she said. ""And we do know that when there are wildfires, this level of [particulate matter] can go very, very, very high.""
Hispanic, Asian and Black people also live in areas with higher annual concentrations of particulate matter, on average, according to the EPA analysis. That's because major sources of pollution such as power plants are commonly built in communities of color, and these areas may have limited resources to regulate emissions.
Dominici said Black and low-income people often have higher rates of chronic health issues such as diabetes or heart disease, and more restricted access to quality health care. As a result, she said, “an additional increase of exposure to air pollution makes them sicker.”
Her study last year found that lowering concentrations of particulate matter would have a greater impact on preventing deaths among Black and low-income white people than among high-income white people.

2024-01-25T22:45:45.276Z,"As measles spreads in England, health authorities warn the outbreak could snowball",NBC News,"LONDON — A serious outbreak of measles in England could grow to tens of thousands of cases, health experts there have warned, as Europe grapples with a spike in the highly contagious disease.
The U.K. Health Security Agency said Friday that since October, there have been 216 confirmed cases and 103 probable cases in the West Midlands region, an urban part of England centered on the city of Birmingham, where around 80% of the cases were recorded. That’s higher than last year’s total of 209 measles cases and the 2022 tally of 53.
Last year, the government warned that a measles outbreak in London could lead to between 40,000 and 160,000 cases there if the vaccination rate did not improve. The rate in England has been falling for years due to misinformation and declining community health budgets.
Around 89% of children in England have received their first measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine dose by age 2, according to the state-run National Health Service — down from 93% a decade ago. The World Health Organization considers 95% the necessary threshold to maintain herd immunity.
A British information campaign is now urging people to ensure their children get the vaccination.
British lawmaker Maria Caulfield, who was previously the minister of state for health, laid bare the scale of the challenge when she told the House of Commons on Monday that more than 3.4 million children under 16 are not vaccinated against measles.
In Europe overall, Hans Kluge, the World Health Organization’s director for the region, warned Wednesday that there had been 42,200 measles cases across 41 countries in 2023 — a nearly 45-fold increase from the 941 recorded the previous year. He said last month that nearly 21,000 people had been hospitalized.
A crisis is also building in central Asia, where more than 13,600 cases were recorded in 2023, the majority among unvaccinated children under 14, the WHO said.
Three U.S. states have also recorded measles cases in the last month. Philadelphia has confirmed at least eight locally acquired cases, in addition to one “imported” case that prompted a health alert in December. Camden County, New Jersey, confirmed a case on Jan. 13, then Georgia health officials confirmed the state’s first case in four years soon after: an unvaccinated resident in Atlanta.
Measles is most common in children. The disease is characterized by a red, blotchy rash that usually follows a high fever, cough, runny nose and red, watery eyes. Around 1 in 5 unvaccinated people with measles are hospitalized, and up to 3 out of 1,000 children with measles die from complications such as pneumonia or swelling of the brain, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The MMR vaccine is offered to children in Britain starting at 12 months, with a second dose shortly after they turn 3. Children in the U.S. get their second dose between 4 and 6 years old. Two shots are 97% effective, according to the CDC.
“Even if you reach them, it’s really difficult to keep such high levels of vaccination sustained over a long period,” said Helen Bedford, a professor at University College London’s Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health. “You get there, the disease goes away, people think, ‘Oh, well, the disease has gone away; I don’t need to vaccinate.’”
Several other factors have fueled England’s vaccination challenges, experts said. One is that uptake remains especially low among low-income and more ethnically diverse groups, according to a 2021 NHS study in southeast England.
“It’s poor people, people who are highly mobile and don’t stay in one place,” said Azeem Majeed, professor of primary care and public health at Imperial College London. “In regards to messaging, the NHS needs to be more proactive on this.”
On Thursday, in an effort to reach non-English speakers, the local council in the borough of Brent released a video about measles in Romanian.
A second factor is a now-discredited study published in 1998 that falsely claimed the MMR vaccine was linked to autism. The paper was partially retracted in 2004, but by then vaccine uptake had dipped to 81%. The study was fully retracted in 2010 and its author, Andrew Wakefield, was removed from the U.K. medical register.
Thousands of children born in the late ’90s and the early 2000s are now unvaccinated adults.
“It’s this combination of low uptake about 20 years ago, so you’ve got lots of young adults that are susceptible, and then over the years an accumulation of susceptible people, particularly in some parts of London,” Bedford said.
However, Bedford doesn’t consider vaccine hesitancy and the spread of conspiracy theories to be the main problem. British parents’ confidence in vaccines is as high as 90%, according to a 2022 study.
“The anti-vaccine movement is very, very small, but it has a very loud voice,” she said. “So I think it’s important not to get too hooked on that because there are lots of things we can do. And if we just focus on anti-vaccine, it’s much more difficult to know what to do.”
Instead, Bedford pointed a finger at two other factors: a reduction in community nurses and reforms made to the NHS — namely the 2013 decision to spread the responsibility for vaccines across several agencies rather than one.
What’s more, she said, there is a lingering opinion among some Britons that measles is a trivial childhood illness, which is a dangerous view.
“In a best-case scenario, measles is a nasty disease that makes children feel very ill. But of course there is a recognized significant complication rate, with ear infections, pneumonia, inflammation of the brain and, yes, it can kill you,” Bedford said.
This week, doctors’ clinics in the West Midlands area urged patients not to turn up unannounced if they suspect they have measles: “Call ahead, that way if you do have measles — you won’t pass it on to others — it can be a fatal disease if someone has a weak immune system,” a public information flyer said.

2024-02-06T00:26:19.650Z,Procedure for an enlarged prostate led to King Charles’ cancer diagnosis,NBC News,"King Charles III was diagnosed with cancer after he underwent a procedure for an enlarged prostate, Buckingham Palace said Monday, but it did not say what kind of cancer it was or how serious the condition is.
“During The King’s recent hospital procedure for benign prostate enlargement, a separate issue of concern was noted. Subsequent diagnostic tests have identified a form of cancer,” the palace said in a statement.
It is unclear what form of cancer was detected, but the palace said Charles does not have prostate cancer.
An enlarged prostate is not linked to cancer, and it is relatively common among older men: Around 80% of men over age 70 have it, according to Yale Medicine. Charles turned 75 in November.
Sometimes, the condition can lead to symptoms such as difficulty urinating, loss of bladder control or waking up at night to urinate multiple times. In such cases, doctors will often recommend a transurethral resection, a procedure to remove extra prostate tissue.
“They go in and they scrape some tissue so that you can pee better, because the problem with the prostate is it’s sitting right at the base of the bladder and it can block urination,” said Dr. William Oh, the chief medical officer of the Prostate Cancer Foundation.
Part of a transurethral resection involves inserting a scope — a tube with a camera at the end — through the urethra. That way, doctors can see the prostate and know where to remove the tissue.
The scope could detect cancer in nearby areas, such as the bladder or the urethra, said Dr. Christian Pavlovich, a professor of urology and oncology at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.
“Sometimes you’ll have a bladder tumor or something that’s not symptomatic, and you’ll just see it when you go in there,” he said.
A scope could also detect bloody urine, ""which could signify something bleeding from the kidney,"" said Dr. Justin Friedlander, a professor of urologic oncology at Fox Chase Cancer Center. That could be a sign of kidney cancer or cancer in the ureter, he said — the tube that passes urine from the kidney to the bladder.
In other instances, doctors may find cancerous tissue that originated in other parts of the body when they’re analyzing prostate tissue that was removed during surgery.
“The prostate could be affected by cancers that are not really of prosthetic origin, like a lymphoma — one of those blood tumors — or a cancer of the urothelium, which is the lining of the urethra and bladder,” Pavlovich said.
That would signal the cancer had spread from other organs and was potentially more advanced, Friedlander said.
Dr. Julio Pow-Sang, the chair of the genitourinary oncology program at Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Florida, said it’s generally rare to find cancerous tissue during a procedure for prostate enlargement.
He said that “90 or 95% of the times it’s benign, but you could have a surprise.”
Buckingham Palace did not specify Monday what kind of procedure Charles underwent for an enlarged prostate, but it has previously referred to it as “corrective.”
Sometimes, instead of performing a transurethral resection, doctors will destroy excess prostate tissue with a laser or high heat — but those procedures are less common.
According to Buckingham Palace, Charles arrived in London on Monday to begin regular outpatient treatments for cancer.
“His Majesty is grateful to his medical team for their expert care and swift intervention, is wholly positive about his treatment and looks forward to returning to full public duty as soon as possible,” the palace said.

2024-02-14T01:19:23.250Z,"CDC says it has no plans to ease Covid isolation yet, despite urging from doctors",NBC News,"People who test positive for Covid should still isolate for five days, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, even though many Americans are already ignoring the policy. That guidance is likely to change at some point, however.
Following reports that the CDC was considering easing Covid isolation restrictions — including guidelines that people can leave their homes after being fever-free for 24 hours — the agency refused to confirm that such plans were in the works. The potential change was first reported by The Washington Post.
But an official at the Department of Health and Human Services who asked not to be identified said federal health officials are considering relaxing Covid isolation guidelines, although the discussions are at an early stage and no definitive decisions have been made.
“It’s way too preliminary,” the source said. There’s “lots more consultation to be had.”
The CDC is looking at changes to its overall Covid guidance, which could include recommendations about masking as well as isolation, said a public health official who was involved with a recent call with the CDC. The CDC currently recommends masking for 10 days following a Covid diagnosis.
There’s no evidence that the virus that causes Covid has evolved to become less dangerous or contagious. What has changed is Americans’ attitudes about Covid restrictions. People are no longer willing or able to spend a week out of work or school because of Covid, experts say.
Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, said he and his colleagues have privately encouraged the CDC to drop the five-day isolation period, in part because there’s little evidence it’s stopping the spread of Covid.
The “rigorous recommendations that are currently in place do not reflect common practice,” Schaffner said. “It’s difficult to demonstrate that strict isolation has had a notable impact on transmission.”
California and Oregon have already broken with the CDC, suggesting that people don't need to stay home if they've been fever-free for 24 hours without medication.
“With each day, the risk of communicability diminishes,” Schaffner said. “Public health recommendations have to be practical.” That is, people may stay home for a few days if they have a fever and feel achy and fatigued. After that, it’s back to business as usual.
Dr. David Margolius, the public health director for the city of Cleveland, said he was also in favor of easing isolation restrictions.
“For a couple years, people really associated public health with the elimination of Covid,” Margolius said. But “public health is about increasing life expectancy for our residents. It’s about improving quality of life. And that is more than just controlling one virus.”
Covid is still contagious, said Dr. Abraar Karan, an infectious disease physician at Stanford Medicine. “What the CDC and health departments are trying to say is that we need to have policies that people are going to actually follow,” Karan said.
As of this month, emergency room visits, hospitalizations and deaths from Covid are down, according to the latest CDC data.
In a statement, the CDC said it had “no updates to Covid guidelines to announce at this time,” adding that it would “continue to make decisions based on the best evidence and science to keep communities healthy and safe.”

2024-01-17T12:01:41.000Z,"Colon cancer is killing more younger men and women than ever, new report finds",NBC News,"Colorectal cancer is the deadliest cancer for men under age 50 — and the second deadliest cancer among women in the same age group, behind breast cancer.
The incidence of colon cancer has been rising for at least the last two decades, when it was the fourth-leading cause of cancer death for both men and women under 50.
Among men and women of all ages, lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death. Prostate cancer is second for men, and breast cancer is second for women. Colorectal cancer is third, overall, for both sexes.
Even as overall cancer deaths continue to fall in the U.S., the American Cancer Society is reporting for the first time that colon and rectal cancers have become leading causes of cancer death in younger adults. The finding was published Wednesday in CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians.
Cancer is traditionally a disease among the elderly, although the percentage of new cases found in people 65 and older has fallen from 61% in 1995 to 58%. The decrease, attributed mainly to drops in prostate and smoking-related cancers, has occurred even though the proportion of people in that age group has grown from 13% to 17% in the general population.
In contrast, new diagnoses among adults ages 50 to 64 have increased since 1995, from 25% to 30%.
Rates of breast and endometrial cancer, as well as mouth and throat disease, have been on the rise. The report did not break down those diagnoses by age.
The findings reflect what cancer doctors have observed for years.
""For a couple of decades now, we have been noticing that the patients coming into our clinic seem to be younger and younger,"" said Dr. Kimmie Ng, the director of the Young Onset Colorectal Cancer Center at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. ""What this report now cements for us is that these trends are real."" Ng was not involved with the new report.
Dr. William Dahut, the chief scientific officer at the American Cancer Society, said younger people tend to be diagnosed at later stages, when the cancer is more aggressive.
""So it's not only having a colorectal cancer — it's colorectal cancer that’s more difficult to treat, which is why we’re seeing these changes in mortality,"" Dahut said.
The diagnosis of late-stage colorectal cancer was a shock to Sierra Fuller, 33, of Acton, Massachusetts, just outside Boston.
It was around Christmas 2021 when Fuller noticed blood in her stool when she went to the bathroom. With no family history of colon cancer, she figured the problem was most likely an annoying hemorrhoid.
Weeks later, the blood deposits worsened, and she started having abdominal pain.
""It was a month from when I got the symptoms to when I sought help, and I realize that I was pushing it,"" she said. Tests revealed she had stage 3b colorectal cancer. That usually means the cancer has started to spread through the colon and possibly to nearby lymph nodes, but not any farther, according to the American Cancer Society.
It was a blow to Fuller and her husband, who had just started talking about whether to try for a baby. They decided to freeze embryos before Fuller's treatment protocol, which would include radiation, chemotherapy and surgery.
It is an example of how cancer uniquely affects young patients.
""People younger than 65 are less likely to have health insurance and more likely to be juggling family and careers,"" Dahut said in a news release announcing the new report. ""Also, men and women diagnosed younger have a longer life expectancy in which to suffer treatment-related side effects, such as second cancers.""
Just over a year later, Fuller is cancer-free but must get regular scans and blood tests. She said that she feels good but that she is ""always going to have that worry"" that her cancer will return.
""If I have to go through this again, whatever that looks like, I'll cross that bridge if it comes,"" Fuller said.
Doctors do not know why cancer, especially colorectal cancer, is becoming more common in younger adults. Some hypothesize that increasing obesity rates, sedentary behavior and unhealthy diets could be playing roles.
""But honestly, the patients we're seeing in clinic often do not fit that profile,"" said Dr. Kimmie Ng, the director of the Young Onset Colorectal Cancer Center at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. ""A lot of them are triathletes and marathon runners. I mean, super healthy people.""
Ng suspects something in the environment may be behind the rise.
""What we suspect may be happening is that whatever combination of environmental factors is responsible for this, that it’s likely changing our microbiomes or our immune systems, leading us to become more susceptible to these cancers at a younger age,"" Ng said.
Colonoscopy screening is generally recommended starting at age 45. People with family histories of the illness may need to begin screening earlier.
A person whose parent was diagnosed with colon cancer at age 50, for example, would need to start screening at age 40, Dahut said.
However, only about a third of people diagnosed with colon cancer have some kind of family history or predisposition to the cancer.
Maintaining a healthy body weight and minimizing red meat in the diet may help reduce risk, Ng said.
Signs that could signal a problem, Ng said, include blood in the stool, abdominal pain, unintentional weight loss and changes in bowel habits.
""If it's getting worse, if it's not going away, you know, that's when somebody really needs to start paying attention and talk to their primary care doctor about what's happening,"" she said.

2024-01-09T23:55:52.466Z,Lloyd Austin's prostate procedure: When is surgery considered 'elective'?,NBC News,"Is surgery for prostate cancer considered an elective procedure?
The Defense Department has described Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin’s surgery to treat his prostate cancer on Dec. 22 as an “elective medical procedure.” Austin, who went home the day after the procedure, later developed complications from the operation and was hospitalized on Jan. 1, Walter Reed National Military Center officials said in a statement Tuesday.
Austin underwent a procedure called a prostatectomy, Walter Reed officials said, in which surgeons remove some or all of the prostate gland.
Aside from skin cancer, prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the U.S., according to the American Cancer Society. The cancer is more likely to develop in older men, and the risk is higher in Black men, the ACS says.
While “elective” can make it sound like the operation wasn’t necessary, the word instead refers to the timing of the surgery.
Simply put, any surgery that’s not needed very quickly to treat a medical emergency is considered an elective procedure.
Operations to treat appendicitis or ruptured gallbladders, for example, are emergency procedures, said Dr. Edward Schaeffer, the director of the Polsky Urologic Cancer Institute and chair of urology at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago.
An elective procedure doesn’t mean the surgery is optional, but rather that it can be scheduled in advance, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine.
With elective surgery, “it doesn’t matter if we do it today or six weeks from now,” said Dr. Michael Stifelman, the chair of urology at Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey. “The outcome will be the same.”
That’s especially the case for surgery for prostate cancer, which Stifelman said is “truly an elective procedure.”
“Prostate cancer is such a slow-growing cancer in many, many cases,"" Stifelman said. ""You can easily wait four to six weeks before treating that patient for the cancer without any concern of changing the outcome.”
Health officials from Walter Reed Medical Center said that Austin's prostate cancer was detected early and that ""his prognosis is excellent.""
Dr. Charles Ryan, the CEO of the Prostate Cancer Foundation, said patients diagnosed early have several options.
“Should I do active surveillance, which means having repeat MRI scans followed with blood tests? Or should I have my prostate removed surgically? Or should I undergo a treatment with radiation and hormonal therapy or radiation alone?” Ryan said.
Because prostate cancer can grow very slowly, some doctors and patients may decide to withhold treatment and instead opt for either active surveillance or watchful waiting. Both involve monitoring the cancer with tests, with active surveillance being the more intensive version.
Monitoring prostate cancer rather than treating it might be recommended if the cancer isn’t causing symptoms, it is small and it hasn’t spread beyond the prostate, or it is expected to grow slowly, according to the American Cancer Society.
""The ideal candidate for that is somebody who’s younger, in their 50s, 60s or early 70s, with a cancer that is very small,"" said Dr. Quoc-Dien Trinh, co-director of the Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women’s Prostate Cancer Center in Boston. Such a patient might need periodic blood tests to check PSA levels, or additional biopsies and MRIs, Trinh said.
Most men who are diagnosed with prostate cancer don’t die from it, the American Cancer Society says.
While Austin experienced complications from his surgery, experts said that, in general, the procedure is very safe.
“For the vast, vast majority of men who go through it, it’s an uncomplicated procedure,” Ryan said. “But, as with all surgical procedures, as with all cancer treatments, there are risks from time to time for complications that require further care.”
Ryan said complications that would lead to a patient’s being hospitalized, such as bleeding or an infection, are rare. “By rare, [I mean] less than 5% of cases,” he said.

2024-01-18T16:08:50.614Z,More evidence suggests a multivitamin may help slow memory loss,NBC News,"Taking a daily multivitamin may protect against memory loss in older adults, according to a trio of studies that included more than 5,000 participants.
Taken together, the three studies found that compared to a placebo, taking a daily multivitamin slowed cognitive aging by about two years, said Dr. Chirag Vyas, an instructor in investigation at Massachusetts General Hospital.
The research was part of the COSMOS trial, a much larger clinical trial that explored whether a daily multivitamin (in this case, Centrum Silver), a cocoa extract supplement or both could be protective against heart disease and cancer.
Results from the third and final study were published Thursday in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. In it, 573 adults ages 60 and up took either a multivitamin or a placebo every day for two years. Researchers evaluated their cognitive function in person and with a series of tests at the beginning and the end of the study. The two earlier studies, which also compared a daily multivitamin to a placebo, used either phone- or web-based tests to measure cognitive function.
Pfizer, the company that makes Centrum Silver, provided the multivitamins and the placebo pills used in the study. Mars Inc., the candy and snack company, partially funded the larger COSMOS trial. Neither company had any role in designing the trials.
The three studies reliably showed that taking a daily multivitamin can have a modest effect on preventing normal memory loss that comes with aging, said Vyas, who led the third study.
In a meta-analysis of all three, the researchers concluded the daily multivitamin benefited both global cognition — things like reasoning, attention and planning — and the ability to recall memories from day-to-day life in healthy older adults.
But it’s unclear which specific vitamins and minerals in a multivitamin are protective or how they exert their effects.
“Future studies are necessary to identify the specific micronutrients contributing most to the cognitive benefits,” Vyas said. Additional research that includes more racial and ethnic diversity is also needed, he said, as the majority of the participants were white.
As people age, the membranes surrounding neurons, or brain cells, start to deteriorate. Vitamins may be able to protect against some of that deterioration, Vyas said.
The notion that vitamins alone could protect cognitive function in older adults is plausible, but there are some caveats based on the relatively short studies, said Dr. Richard Caselli, a professor emeritus of neurology at the Mayo Clinic in Arizona.
“The amount of cognitive change that happens over the course of three years in healthy individuals who don’t have Alzheimer’s is pretty minimal,” he said.
Caselli said that while he would feel comfortable recommending a daily multivitamin to older patients, he isn’t sold that it would have a significant impact on cognitive function.
“I still maintain a bit of skepticism as far as what magnitude of impact this makes,” he said. “I’m doubtful the difference would be really big.”
Dr. Zaldy Tan, a geriatric medicine physician at the Cedars Sinai Jona Goldrich Center for Alzheimer’s and Memory Disorders in Los Angeles, said it’s most likely some patients would benefit more than others.
“Certainly a subset of people who are vitamin-deficient in their diets could benefit in general from a multivitamin and potentially from a cognitive standpoint,” Tan said. “But it’s hard to say right now if it’s the multivitamin causing the improvement or something else.”
Tan noted that a deficiency of some specific vitamins, including B12, A and E, have been tied to deteriorating cognitive health, though the evidence isn’t conclusive. Some people who have vitamin deficiencies may benefit from supplementing with vitamins, but it’s less likely that everyone in the general public would.
Caselli said that to protect against cognitive decline, it’s important that people take care of their overall health.
“A general rule of thumb is that everything that is bad for your body is bad for your brain and everything that is good for your body is good for your brain,” he said.
Caselli said he recommends people maintain their social lives and stay both mentally and physically active throughout older age. Common health conditions, including heart disease, sleep apnea and diabetes, can also impair brain health, he said. As far as taking a daily multivitamin, he said, people can go for it if they are worried they aren’t getting enough vitamins and minerals from their diets.
“Taking a multivitamin supplement is probably good for you, but we don’t know if it’s likely to have a big impact in people who have a healthy diet,” Caselli said.

2024-02-09T21:46:26.227Z,Oregon's first case of human plague in 8 years likely came from a pet cat,NBC News,"Health officials announced this week that a resident of Deschutes County — a rural part of Oregon — was diagnosed with plague, marking the state's first human case in more than eight years. The person was likely infected by their pet cat, who had developed symptoms, according to Deschutes County Health Services.
Humans are most commonly exposed to plague from the bites of fleas carrying Yersinia pestis, the bacterium that causes the disease. Household pets can get also infected if they hunt rodents infected with plague or are similarly bitten by an infected flea.
Pets can then transfer the infection to humans via tissue or bodily fluids, such as respiratory droplets from cough or sneezes. Alternatively, they might carry home fleas that in turn bite humans.
Cats are particularly susceptible to plague because their bodies have a hard time clearing the infection and they're more likely than some other pets to chase and capture rodents.
Plague is much rarer in dogs. However, in 2014, Colorado reported four cases of plague among people who had been in close contact with an infected pit bull terrier, including the dog's owner and two veterinary clinic employees.
Dr. Richard Fawcett, a health officer for Deschutes County, said the cat involved in the recent case was ""very sick"" and had a draining abscess, which indicated ""a fairly substantial"" infection.
The owner's infection likely started out in a lymph node — what's known as bubonic plague, Fawcett said. By the time the owner was hospitalized, the infection had progressed to the bloodstream, he said. Fawcett said the patient ""responded very well to antibiotic treatment.""
However, he noted that some doctors felt the patient had developed a cough while at the hospital. That could be an early sign of pneumonic plague — a version that transmits among humans — but Fawcett said it’s not clear if the disease had progressed that far.
Fawcett said doctors gave antibiotics to the patient's close contacts out of an abundance of caution to prevent any potential infections from developing into symptoms.
""If we know a patient has the bacteria in the blood, we might decide to be on the safe side,"" Fawcett said. He added that he would be ""very surprised if we see any other cases.""
Prior to this week, Oregon’s last human plague case was in 2015: A teenage girl presumably got infected from a flea bite during a hunting trip, the state health department said at the time.
On average, the U.S. sees around seven cases of human plague each year, mostly in the rural West. Cases are typically concentrated in northern New Mexico, northern Arizona, southern Colorado, California, southern Oregon and western Nevada, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
""The hot spot is really the Four Corners region"" near the borders of Utah, Arizona, Colorado and New Mexico, said David Wagner, director of the Biodefense and Disease Ecology Center at Northern Arizona University’s Pathogen and Microbiome Institute.
But ""we still don’t have a good handle of plague persistence in the environment in the Western U.S.,"" Wagner said. ""It’s just so cryptic. It kind of disappears into these populations of rodents and we just don’t know what’s going on out there.""
Fawcett said he's also not sure why cases have sporadically popped up in central Oregon over the last dozen or so years.
""We just don’t have a lot of trouble with fleas in this part of the state,"" he said, adding that rodents carrying plague don't seem to be a particular issue either.
According to the CDC, plague tends to occur in semi-arid forests and grasslands that are home to many rodent species. Fawcett said the person who recently got sick in Deschutes County lives in a rural-suburban neighborhood, and ""there is open land not far away"" from the person's home.
Deschutes County Health Services advises pet owners to keep their animals on a leash when outdoors, give them flea control products and take them to a veterinarian if they become sick after touching a rodent. The department also asks people to avoid contact with rodents and refrain from feeding squirrels or chipmunks.
More than 80% of plague cases in the U.S. are bubonic, meaning the infection is confined to the lymph nodes. People with bubonic plague usually develop symptoms two to eight days after they're bitten by an infected flea or come in contact with an infected animal.
The most common sign of bubonic plague is swollen, painful lymph nodes. Other symptoms include a sudden fever, nausea, weakness, chills or muscle aches. Doctors test for the infection via a blood or tissue sample, then treat it with antibiotics.
The bubonic plague that killed more than a third of Europe's population in the 14th century was a much different threat from the one now, Wagner said.
""It’s the same thing that caused the Black Death, but that was in the pre-antibiotic era,"" Wagner said. ""Now it’s very easily treated with simple antibiotics.""
If bubonic plague isn't treated early, however, bacteria can enter the bloodstream and cause sepsis — or septicemic plague. Typical signs of a bloodstream infection include extreme weakness, abdominal pain or bleeding from the nose, mouth or under the skin. People's skin may also turn black, especially on their nose, fingers and toes.
An untreated bubonic or septicemic infection can lead to a lung infection, or pneumonic plague, which is often deadly. People can get also pneumonic plague directly by inhaling infectious droplets.
Fawcett said these different forms of plague can co-exist at the same time, and it's not entirely clear when the disease transitions from one stage to another or becomes contagious among humans.
That said, he's confident that the general risk in Deschutes County is low. As long as the health department is monitoring close contacts, he said, ""I do not imagine that would be hardly any significant risk to our community.""

2024-01-25T04:16:08.284Z,Do Stanley cups contain lead or pose a risk of lead poisoning? Experts weigh in,NBC News,"Stanley is responding to claims that its products contain lead, clarifying that, yes, lead is used in the manufacturing process, but the product needs to become damaged to expose the lead, a Stanley spokesperson told TODAY.com in a statement.
On the bottom of each quencher made by the beverage container powerhouse is a circular barrier made of stainless steel, which covers a pellet that contains lead, a spokesperson for Stanley said. The pellet seals the product’s vacuum insulation, and it isn’t accessible unless the stainless steel barrier comes off — which is possible but “rare,” the spokesperson said.
“Our engineering and supply chain teams are making progress on innovative, alternative materials for use in the sealing process,” the spokesperson added. In a separate statement to NBC affiliate WCNC of Charlotte, North Carolina, the company said all of its products follow all U.S. regulatory requirements.
In a recent flurry of social media posts, some Stanley customers said they are using at-home tests to assess whether there’s lead in any of their Stanley products, to mixed results (though what part of the cup is being tested and the quality of lead test being used often aren’t clear).
TODAY.com spoke with multiple experts and government officials to understand why lead exposure is so dangerous and how contamination generally occurs.
Yes, Stanley uses lead in its manufacturing process for its cups, but they pose a risk of lead exposure only if the cover on the bottom of the tumbler comes off and exposes the pellet used to seal the cup’s vacuum insulation, a Stanley spokesperson said. If this happens, you can submit a claim through the company’s lifetime warranty.
The liquid inside a Stanley mug doesn’t come in contact with the pellet, so there’s little to no chance of lead exposure from drinking liquid inside the container. The risk is if the circular cover comes off and users touch the exposed lead and then touch their mouths or noses, experts say.
Lead poisoning activist Tamara Rubin, aka Lead Safe Mama, first brought attention to the presence of lead in Stanley tumblers in March 2023. Rubin earns a commission on the products she recommends that are purchased through her website. Some of her recommendations include competitors to Stanley.
She has been passionate about protecting other parents from the dangers of lead poisoning ever since her then-7-month-old son was exposed to lead paint dust during a home renovation and suffered severe permanent brain damage. Rubin now advocates against using lead in any products that enter the home. In February, she sent Consumer Reports a tip based on her own lead testing that later led to a product recall. She has also submitted reports to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, or CPSC, about similar products that she says led to four additional recalls.
Related: The right and wrong way to clean a Stanley cup, according to experts
Rubin said parents often send her items that they suspect could contain lead, and she uses XRF technology, the same $35,000 spectrometer instrument used by the CPSC, to test for the presence of lead and other heavy metals. She said that she has tested several Stanley tumblers that people have sent her after the protective covers at the bottom have come off and that she has found lead.
“Though some people say [the] protective disc doesn’t come off easily, I’ve heard from many people who say that for them it has,” Rubin said, estimating that the latter group is in the hundreds.
She added that, based on her own experience and what other parents have told her, heavy use, repeated washings and children’s fidgeting with the area can increase the likelihood the covers will come off. She said some people have told her they don’t know how the covers came off and weren’t even aware the cups were damaged at first.
Lead is a naturally occurring metal found abundantly throughout the Earth, per the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. Soil usually contains lead concentrations of less than 50 parts per million, but many urban areas contain soil with up to 200 parts per million, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
A relatively inexpensive, durable and stable metal that doesn’t rust, lead was once widely used during the early-to-mid-1900s and could be found in toys, gasoline, food, jewelry, cooking utensils, ceramics, electronics, batteries, plumbing pipes, paint and even cosmetics.
Federal and state laws have helped lower the amount of lead people are exposed to, but it is still found in some products today. In fact, the CDC tracks lead-related product recalls, from children’s clothing to food to cosmetics to medicine.
“Most people think of lead poisoning as a thing of the past, but lead is still all around us, often at dangerous enough levels to cause significant harm,” Jenna Forsyth, a research scientist specializing in epidemiology and environmental science at Stanford University School of Medicine, told TODAY.com.
Lead poisoning is most commonly caused by breathing in lead dust or particles, but it can also occur by touching a surface where lead is present, then touching one’s nose or mouth, thereby ingesting trace amounts of the toxic metal, according to the CDC.
“One family I worked with had a young child who got lead poisoning from ingesting oatmeal that he had playfully smashed with the bottom of a water bottle where lead was exposed,” Rubin said. (The bottle wasn’t made by Stanley.)
Once lead enters the bloodstream, it can accumulate and cause severe health consequences, including cardiovascular disease and brain damage. Ronnie Levin, a 40-year veteran scientist with the Environmental Protection Agency who now teaches at Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, told TODAY.com that lead is an “all-systems toxin. ... There isn’t a system in your body — from your nervous system to your immune system to your reproductive system — that isn’t harmed by it.”
A study published in The Lancet estimates that in 2019, more than 5 million adults worldwide died from cardiovascular disease related to lead exposure. Children are especially vulnerable, because they absorb lead more easily than adults.
“Even low levels of lead that were once considered safe have been linked to harmful changes in intelligence, behavior and health,” Paul Allwood, the lead poisoning prevention and surveillance branch chief at the CDC’s National Center for Environmental Health, said in an email.
As long as that cover at the bottom of your Stanley cup stays in place, Levin said, there is no risk in owning the product. “If that barrier remains intact, you won’t be exposed to any lead and won’t suffer any negative outcomes,” she said.
What’s more, health issues rarely arise from a single instance of lead exposure. “Repeated exposure to lead is what’s most worrisome,” Dr. Vicki Iannotti, a pediatrician at ColumbiaDoctors in Tarrytown, New York, and an assistant professor of pediatrics at Columbia University, told TODAY.com.
It’s that kind of repeated exposure that concerns Rubin the most.
“Children, and especially babies, like to fidget with things that have dimples they can rub,” she said. “If a parent lets their child fidget with an item like a Stanley mug after the bottom cap has come off, there is a very possible and likely transference of microparticulate lead via normal hand-to-mouth behavior in young children.”
Levin echoed similar concerns: “Though lead poisoning is unlikely to happen from a single instance, if a child puts the bottom of one of these cups against their mouth or rubs the surface with their fingers and then puts them in their mouth, contamination can occur.”
Forsyth agreed that risk of exposure from a single instance of touching lead “is pretty low” but said there are scenarios that could increase the risk, such as scraping the exposed led against a hard surface. For example, if a cup with exposed lead is slid across a counter or moved in and out of a cupholder with hard edges, “tiny pieces of lead could flake off,” she said.
And when lead comes in contact with anything acidic, it can become more absorbable, Forsyth said. That could occur if you’re drinking out of a cup with exposed lead and peeling an orange, then touch the exposed lead with fingers that have touched the orange and then touch your nose or mouth. “Ingesting lead is what you need to avoid the most,” Forsyth said.
So keep an eye on the bottom of your Stanley cup to make sure that cover stays where it’s supposed to be. And if the cover does come off and exposes the seal containing lead, customers can submit a claim under the product’s lifetime warranty.
Stanley isn’t alone in using lead-containing pellets to seal its insulated cups. The Stanley spokesperson said in the statement that the pellet the company uses is “industry standard.” And Rubin said she has tested bottles from other companies that make insulated cups with similar pellets covered in fashion similar to Stanley’s.
It’s important to note that the CPSC monitors products, including insulated tumblers, for violating lead regulations and has recently recalled several children’s products for having accessible pellets that contain levels that exceed the federal lead content ban, CPSC press secretary Patty Davis told TODAY.com. Examples include products sold by PandaEar, Cupkin, Tiblue, Klickpick and Laoion.
Davis encourages consumers to report any lead-related concerns they have for any product on the market to the CPSC at www.saferproducts.gov. “Each report is reviewed and could potentially lead to a recall,” she said.

2024-01-31T16:13:06.264Z,Novo Nordisk says more patients can start taking Wegovy after it boosts supply,NBC News,"Novo Nordisk said Wednesday that it has increased the supply of the lowest dose of its blockbuster weight loss drug Wegovy, which it says will allow more people in the U.S. to start taking the drug.
Last May, overwhelming demand for the drug led Novo Nordisk to restrict the supply of the lowest dose of Wegovy, also called the starter dose, in order to avoid shortages of higher doses.
Because the medication can come with gastrointestinal side effects, such as nausea and vomiting, doctors often start new patients on the lowest dose and then gradually increase the dosage over several weeks.
Novo Nordisk's supply restrictions — an attempt to keep enough supply available for people already on the weight loss drug — meant that many new patients were unable to start treatment.
What’s more, some people who wanted Wegovy were instead prescribed Ozempic off-label for weight loss, leaving people with diabetes unable to get their medication. (Ozempic, also from Novo Nordisk, is approved for diabetes and shares the same active ingredient as Wegovy, called semagluatide.)
Novo Nordisk made the announcement during a call with reporters discussing its 2023 financial results.
It also said insurance coverage of the weight loss drug continues to improve.
About 50 million people in the U.S. with obesity should be able to get coverage for Wegovy, according to the company.

2024-01-18T20:11:03.440Z,Long Covid explanation in new study possibly paves way for tests and treatments,NBC News,"Scientists have identified a persistent change in a handful of blood proteins in people with long Covid that indicates that an important part of their immune system remains on high alert for months after an acute infection.
The findings, published Thursday in the journal Science, could help explain what causes the persistent fatigue, brain fog and other debilitating symptoms of long Covid, as well as pave the way for diagnostic tests and potentially, a long-awaited treatment, experts say.
The study followed 113 Covid patients for up to one year after they were first infected, along with 39 healthy controls. At the six-month mark, 40 patients had developed long Covid symptoms.
Repeated blood samples turned up important differences in their blood: A group of proteins indicated that a part of the body’s immune system called the complement system remained activated long after it should have returned to normal.
“When you have a viral or bacterial infection, the complement system becomes activated and binds to these viruses and bacteria and then eliminates them,” said Dr. Onur Boyman, a professor of immunology at the University of Zurich in Switzerland and one of the study’s investigators. The system then returns to its resting state, where its regular job is to clear the body of dead cells, he said.
But if the complement system remains in its microbe-fighting state after the viruses and bacteria are eliminated, “it starts damaging healthy cells,” he said.
“These can be endothelial cells that line the inner layers of blood vessels, the cells of the blood itself, and cells in different organs, like the brain or the lungs,” he continued. The result is tissue damage and microclots in the blood.
Previous studies have documented blood clotting and tissue damage in people with long Covid. “But this research gets at the molecular mechanism of how that might be initiated,” said Akiko Iwasaki, a professor of immunobiology and molecular, cellular and developmental biology at the Yale School of Medicine, who was not involved with the new study.
Tissue damage along with blood clots can lead to the disabling symptoms of long Covid, including an intolerance to exercise.
During exercise, the heart pumps more blood and agitates the endothelial cells inside blood vessels, which are everywhere in the body, Boyman said.
“In healthy people, normal endothelial cells can take these changes, but the inflamed endothelial cells in long Covid patients cannot,” he said.
Iwasaki noted that microclots can reduce the level of oxygen and nutrients delivered to different organs.
“If your brain, for example, isn’t getting enough oxygen, obviously there will be a lot of issues with memory, brain fog and fatigue,” she said.
A little more than 14% of adults in the United States report ever having experienced long Covid, according to the most recent data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Household Pulse Survey.
Dr. Monica Verduzco-Gutierrez, chair of rehabilitation medicine at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio and head of its long Covid clinic, praised the new study.
“Understanding the mechanisms of long Covid is how we’re going to figure out treatments,” she said.
Other studies have also identified potential mechanisms. In one study, published in the October issue of the journal Cell, researchers suggested that remnants of the virus lingering in the gut of long Covid patients triggered reductions in the neurotransmitter serotonin. Lower serotonin levels, they said, could explain some neurological and cognitive symptoms. Another study, published in the journal Nature in September by Iwasaki and her colleagues, found that long Covid patients had significantly lower levels of the hormone cortisol than other Covid patients and healthy controls. Cortisol helps people feel alert and awake.
Verduzco-Gutierrez, Iwasaki and Boyman agree that the new research points the way toward developing diagnostic tests and treatment by focusing on the proteins of the complement system.
However, Boyman and his colleagues used cutting-edge, complicated methods for detecting the differences in these proteins that could not be used in a routine diagnostic lab.
“We need companies already active in diagnostics that have sufficient manpower and financial power” to develop a simplified test, he said.
Once a test is developed, or with rigorous screening for long Covid patients, pharmaceutical companies could begin clinical trials of potential treatments, Boyman said. Drugs already exist to modulate and inhibit the complement system for very rare immune diseases that affect the kidneys, muscles or nervous system, and they could be tested in long Covid patients, he said.
New drugs could also be developed, Iwasaki said.
“I think there are a lot of things that we can try in the future,” she said. But first, the results of this study need to be replicated, as with any research, she added.
Verduzco-Gutierrez said she would like to see any future studies follow patients for a longer period of time. “What about people who have had long Covid for three years? We don’t know what their blood looks like,” she said.

2024-02-23T20:29:42.237Z,Seven cases of measles confirmed in Florida outbreak that began in an elementary school,NBC News,"Seven people have been diagnosed with measles in an outbreak that started at the Manatee Bay Elementary School in Weston, Florida.
The Florida Department of Health in Broward County announced in a notice to local health care providers on Feb. 16 that a third grader with no history of travel had been diagnosed. Three other measles cases at the elementary school were confirmed on Saturday, followed by one each on Monday and Tuesday.
The latest case to appear in the state's surveillance system is a child 4 years old or younger — the first case outside the school. Of the other six cases, three were in children ages 5 to 9, and three in those 10 to 14.
The county health department issued an advisory Sunday saying that it was “working with all partners, including Broward County Public Schools and local hospitals, to identify contacts that are at risk of transmission.”
The Florida Department of Health has not recommended that all the school's students — or even just unvaccinated ones — stay home, as is generally done in such outbreaks. Instead, it is ""deferring to parents or guardians to make decisions about school attendance,"" according to a letter Tuesday from Joseph Ladapo, the state's surgeon general.
It’s not publicly known whether those infected were vaccinated, NBC 6 South Florida reported. Two doses of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine are 97% effective.
John J. Sullivan, communications and legislative affairs officer for the Broward County Public School District, said in a statement on Friday that ""the school will continue with all the preventative measures that have been implemented, such as enhanced cleanings at the school, and remains in communication with its families.""
Manatee Bay Elementary School referred NBC News to the school district for information about the outbreak.
The health department in Broward County said in a statement that it was ""carrying out an epidemiological investigation"" of the measles outbreak and working to identify close contacts of those diagnosed, but that ""all details regarding the investigation are confidential.""
In the 2022-23 school year, Florida’s statewide MMR vaccination rate was around 91%, compared to the national rate of 93%, according to a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The U.S. rate has declined from 95% since the 2020-21 school year. The World Health Organization considers 95% the threshold necessary for herd immunity from measles.
Measles is highly contagious. Symptoms typically begin to appear a week or two after infection, and can include a cough, runny nose, fever and red, watery eyes. Small, white spots may appear inside the mouth a couple days later, followed by a rash consisting of flat, red spots that start on the face and spread to the neck, torso and limbs.
One in 5 unvaccinated people in the U.S. who get measles are hospitalized with severe complications. As many as 1 in 20 children with measles develop pneumonia, the leading cause of death for those in the age group who get the disease. People who are unvaccinated or immunocompromised also face a risk of swelling in the brain or death.
As of Thursday, 35 measles cases had been reported across 15 states already this year, including an outbreak of at least eight cases in Philadelphia last month, according to the CDC. Last month, the agency issued a warning to health providers to be on the lookout for more cases. Last year, 58 cases were reported in total.
Dr. Charles Mitchell, a professor of pediatric infectious disease at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, said the recent measles outbreaks may be the result of growing vaccine hesitancy.
“My suspicion is that there is unfortunately some questioning of utility or the acceptance of vaccines,” Mitchell said Tuesday afternoon. “I think going forward, I would not be surprised if we begin to see the recurrence of these cases. I mean, the fact that you have five cases of measles at this one elementary school suggests to me that the rate of vaccination may have fallen off.”
Mitchell emphasized that the MMR vaccine is especially crucial because there aren’t any treatments or cures for measles.
“I suspect that some people have lost their fear,” Mitchell added. “I don’t think they remember what it was like back in the ’60s or ’70s.”

2024-02-06T20:01:06.230Z,"Exposure to police violence linked to poor sleep in Black adults, study finds",NBC News,"Black adults who are exposed to news of police killings of unarmed Black people are more likely to suffer from poor sleep in the months to come than white adults, according to a study published Monday in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine.
The new research highlights the insidious toll police violence takes on the Black community.
Police killings not only affect victims and their families but can have “pernicious spillover effects” onto the public at large, said the lead study author, Dr. Atheendar Venkataramani, an associate professor of medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania.
The findings looked at survey results about sleep duration from 2013 through 2019 from two U.S. databases. The larger of the two, the Behavioral Risk Factor and Surveillance Survey, included responses from 181,865 Black and nearly 1.8 million white participants. The other, the American Time Use Survey, included data from 9,858 Black respondents and 46,532 white respondents.
Even at the baseline, Black participants were more likely to report getting less sleep than white participants. Forty-six percent reported getting less than 7 hours of sleep a night, deemed “short sleep,” compared to 33% of white participants, in the Behavioral Risk Factor and Surveillance Survey. About 18% of Black respondents reported getting less than six hours of sleep a night, or “very short sleep,” compared to 10% of white respondents.
The researchers then looked at what happened to sleep after 331 police-involved killings of unarmed Black people. They found that Black people’s sleep worsened in the six months that followed police killings, while white people had no change in their sleep.
The impact was greater for police killings that rose to national prominence, such as the killing of Eric Garner in New York in 2014. After such deaths, the study found, Black people reported a 4.6% increase in short sleep and an 11.4% increase in very short sleep, compared with the average.
For all police killings, researchers saw an increase in shortened sleep among Black people living in the states where the killings took place. Reports of short sleep increased by 2.7% and reports of very short sleep increased by 6.5% in the six months after police killings in those states, the study found.
The study points to dangers in society that other groups may not face, and it is a reminder that discrimination is a threat to “people’s health and livelihood,” Venkataramani said.
“There are lots of reasons why Black Americans’ sleep — at least in terms of duration as well as quality — is worse than for potentially other groups,” he said. “Part of it has to do with some economic factors, the types of jobs people are in, the environments people are living in — with regards to the noise or crime or things that are around — and the experience of discrimination can also create stress, which is bad for sleep.”
Lack of sleep is tied to a number of chronic health conditions, including heart disease, high blood pressure and risk of stroke, according to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. It can also interfere with cognitive functions, including learning, focusing and judging people’s emotions and reactions.
Chronic sleep deprivation caused by stress, racial trauma and other factors can increase Black Americans’ risk of developing anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, said Dr. Carmen Black, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Yale University. Black, who works with predominantly patients of color in her practice, said she uses self-validation for those who experience issues with sleep, especially if it results from structural racism.
“It’s OK to feel this way, because you’re responding to very real, very harmful things,” Black said she tells her patients. “The next thing I ask them is ‘Would you even feel safe if I tried to put you back to sleep?’ because they’re often being reminded of neighborhood violence when they witness these murders. They’re often being reminded of structural safety concerns in their neighborhood.”
Self-validation is a tool also used by Christiana Awosan, a program director of marriage and family therapy at Iona University in New York. She said her clinic’s “phone was ringing nonstop” following George Floyd’s death in 2020 with calls from Black patients seeking help and wanting to talk about their racial trauma.
Awosan said she also helps her patients focus on ways they can take care of themselves, including what they eat and drink, and even ways for them to affirm their Blackness.
“Usually people know what they need to do to take care of themselves,” Awosan said. “It’s just that people are not given the space and that time to really think about those things and to intentionally do it.”
Awosan suggests that patients unplug from their phones, televisions and other forms of media two to three hours before they go to sleep. Meditation, reading, listening to calming music and praying are also methods her patients practice to help themselves fall asleep. Being “patient with your body” is also key, she added.
“I think sometimes, because we don’t understand what’s going on, then we’re, like, frustrated,” Awosan said. “Your body is responding to trauma. It makes sense that your body’s feeling this way.”
For Black’s patients who have trouble sleeping, she suggests avoiding taking naps during the day and not consuming large amounts of caffeine.
Still, experts agreed that those tactics don’t address the underlying problem of structural racism. The findings emphasize the need for evidence-based reforms to eliminate police killings of unarmed people in Black communities, the researchers wrote.
“Society needs to pay attention to the way in which racial trauma really impacts the emotional, mental and physical well-being of Black people and any persons of color — any person that’s marginalized,” Awosan said. Medical professionals also need to assess and pay attention more to Black patients’ symptoms and the potential causes, she added.
Black agreed, saying “the answer to dismantling structural racism is dismantling structural racism,” she said.
“I believe that every physician should be an activist,” she said.

2024-01-30T23:39:17.632Z,"Improving fitness may be linked to a 35% lower risk of prostate cancer, study finds",NBC News,"Plenty of research has linked regular exercise to a lower risk of cancer, but a new study suggests that getting into better shape could reduce the risk of prostate cancer in particular, a diagnosis that around 113 out of every 100,000 men get every year in the U.S.
The research, published Tuesday in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, showed that men whose cardiorespiratory fitness improved by 3% or more annually over five years, on average, were 35% less likely to develop prostate cancer than men whose cardiorespiratory fitness declined by 3% annually. That was true regardless of men’s fitness levels when they started out.
It's evidence, in other words, that ""no matter what age, no matter where you are in your life or your relative fitness, that if you improve your fitness, even by a relatively small amount, you may significantly decrease your risk of developing prostate cancer,” said Dr. William Oh, the chief medical officer of the Prostate Cancer Foundation, who wasn’t involved in the research.
Cardiorespiratory fitness is a measure of how well the heart and lungs deliver oxygen to the muscles during exercise.
For the study, researchers from the Swedish School of Sport and Health Sciences analyzed data from more than 57,000 men in Sweden who were enrolled in a health database as early as 1982. The men took at least two fitness tests, which involved pedaling on a stationary bike and estimating the volume of oxygen they used during vigorous exercise based on their heart rate. A higher volume indicated a greater fitness level.
The tests were generally done years apart, though the exact interval varied by participant. The researchers then analyzed whether the men had developed prostate cancer after an average of seven years had passed since their last fitness tests.
The results indicated that men could decrease their risk of prostate cancer by improving their cardiorespiratory fitness through activities that elevate their heart rates, said a co-author of the study, Kate Bolam, a researcher at the Swedish School of Sport and Health Sciences.
“They want to aim for more vigorous intensity activities — that’s activities that we would do and we would struggle to maintain a conversation with a friend,” she said. “It could be line dancing if that gets your heart rate up and you think it’s fun and you’re going to do it regularly.”
Jogging, hiking or swimming are all good options, as well.
Before the new study, research had yielded mixed results about whether exercise decreased the risk of prostate cancer. Some studies even found that men with high fitness levels had a slightly increased risk of prostate cancer — but other factors may have skewed those results, said Dr. June Chan, a urology professor at the University of California, San Francisco.
“People who exercise more generally have other healthy lifestyle practices, which would include being screened for prostate cancer,” she said. “That could create this appearance of there being a positive association.”
However, when the Swedish researchers took into account men’s baseline levels of fitness at the time of their first tests, they found that only those with moderate fitness levels — not very high or low — saw a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer.
There may be two reasons for that, Bolam said: People who are very physically active may not get additional benefits from improving their cardiorespiratory fitness beyond a certain threshold. On the other end of the spectrum, people who don't exercise may have other health conditions that raise their risk of prostate cancer, such as obesity, and relatively small improvements to their fitness may not be enough to lower that risk.
The researchers also didn’t find an association between changes in cardiorespiratory fitness and the risk of dying from prostate cancer. There may simply have been too few deaths in the study group to detect a link, they said.
Other studies have suggested that improving cardiorespiratory fitness lowers the risk of dying from cancer overall. A study last year found that at least 120 minutes of moderate exercise or at least 40 minutes of strenuous exercise per week reduced the overall risk of death among cancer patients. (The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services generally recommends 150 minutes of moderate physical activity per week, with muscle strengthening activities on at least two of those days.)
Chan's past research also found that intense exercise improved outcomes in men already diagnosed with prostate cancer. A study in 2011 found that at least three hours per week of vigorous exercise could substantially improve survival rates. Another study the same year found that brisk walking could inhibit or delay cancer progression.
“It led us to have a hypothesis that something about getting your heart rate up is important,” she said. Although the exact mechanism linking exercise and cancer risk isn't fully understood, it could be that physical activity can help with weight loss, improve the body’s response to insulin or reduce chronic inflammation.
Oh noted, though, that there are other risk factors for prostate cancer besides physical fitness.
“As much as a third of patients may have a true genetic risk, which means that the rest of the risk is probably related to lifestyle and environment,” he said. “People cannot control their genetic backgrounds, and often, we can’t control our environments as much as we’d like. The only thing we can really control is our lifestyle.”

2024-01-30T21:08:38.968Z,"Ohio reverses local flavored tobacco bans, infuriating doctors",NBC News,"On New Year's Day, the city of Columbus, Ohio, did what the federal government has not been able to: ban the sale of menthol cigarettes.
Three weeks later, the state Legislature voted to reinstate menthol and other flavored tobacco products — and strip all its cities of their ability to regulate what type of tobacco is sold or enforce who is old enough to buy it.
Ohio is just the latest state to limit what local communities can do about tobacco use. At least 39 other states have passed similar laws, according to the American Lung Association.
The move has frustrated public health officials in Ohio who say residents are already at greater risk of dying early from smoking-related diseases. The state has one of the highest smoking rates among adults in the country: 17.1%, compared to the national rate of 11.5%, according to the American Cancer Society.
""I am very concerned when politicians start deciding what they think is best for the health of the population,"" said Dr. Mysheika Roberts, health commissioner for Columbus Public Health. ""We know that tobacco products are harmful.""
Leo Almeida, the Ohio government relations director for the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, said that smoking is responsible for an estimated 20,200 adult deaths in the state each year.
""There are currently 259,000 Ohio children who are alive today that will likely die prematurely from a smoking-related disease,"" such as cancer or heart disease, he said.
Flavored tobacco products, in particular, have been the focus of public health organizations and anti-smoking groups for more than a decade. Experts blame the meteoric rise of teen vaping on candy- and fruit-flavored e-cigarettes. The federal government banned flavored e-cigarettes in 2020, but left menthol products on the market.
A federal ban on menthol, which was expected last year, has been delayed until at least March. A White House spokeswoman said Monday that the administration had no update on the matter.
The inaction prompted the city of Columbus and some of its suburbs to pass their own flavor bans, including menthol. Lawmakers in Cleveland had also begun the process of prohibiting flavored tobacco products.
That all went away Jan. 24 when the Ohio Senate voted to override its governor's veto of this provision: ""It is the intent of the general assembly to preempt political subdivisions from the regulation of tobacco products and alternative nicotine products."" In other words, cities, counties and townships in Ohio cannot take it upon themselves to enact or enforce any tobacco-control laws.
The action negated Columbus' ban on flavored tobacco products and erased any chance that Cleveland would put forth such a law.
""This is beyond frustrating,"" said Micah Berman, a public health and law expert with the Center for Tobacco Research at the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center. ""This is about the most obvious thing that we can do to prevent people from getting cancer.""
State tobacco regulation, such as the one that prohibits anyone under age 21 from buying cigarettes, will stand.
But local jurisdictions would be powerless to enforce them, Berman said. The provision is expected to take effect at the end of April.
The issue is a priority for health officials in Cleveland, where 35% of adults smoke.
""Smoking is the No. 1 preventable cause of death and disease and disability in the city of Cleveland,"" said Dr. David Margolius, Cleveland's public health director.
Black communities are impacted the most, and use menthol products at far higher rates. Nearly 85% of Black smokers use menthols, compared to 30% of white smokers, according to the Food and Drug Administration. And Black men have the highest lung cancer death rate in the U.S.
""We had hoped to take our destiny into our own hands by passing a local law that would help save lives. But now the state has prohibited us from doing that,"" Margolius said. ""We are really counting on the White House to step in.""

2024-03-13T18:00:40.000Z,"Playing with dogs helps people concentrate and relax, brain recordings show",NBC News,"Plenty of research has investigated the bond between humans and dogs, demonstrating that canine companions can improve people’s moods, reduce blood pressure and lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol. Just looking dogs in the eye may even boost levels of oxytocin, a hormone associated with feelings of love and trust.
But few past studies have pinpointed what happens in people’s brains when they interact with a furry friend.
A study published Wednesday did exactly that: Researchers in South Korea attached headsets of electrodes to 30 adults, then measured changes in their brainwaves as they interacted with a poodle named Aro. The results indicated that walking the dog made the participants feel more relaxed, brushing her improved concentration, and playing with her yielded both of these effects.
“Previous studies of the potential benefits of animal interactions often take a holistic approach, comparing people’s mood or hormone levels before and after spending time with a dog,” Onyoo Yoo, the study’s author and a researcher at Konkuk University in South Korea, said in an email.
“It is a significant finding that engaging in certain activities with dogs can increase specific brain activity,” Yoo added.
For the study, published in the journal PLOS ONE, Yoo's team had participants engage in eight activities for three minutes each: meeting, playing, feeding, massaging, grooming, photographing, hugging and walking 4-year-old Aro.
The participants wore the brainwave-detecting headsets during the activities, then completed surveys after each one to describe how they felt emotionally.
The researchers found that participants' alpha brain waves, which indicate stability and relaxation, became stronger when they played with Aro using squeaky toys and when they took her for a walk on a park trail. Those results suggested people were experiencing an increased state of rest and relaxation.
Beta brain waves, which are associated with attention and concentration, became stronger when participants played with Aro, brushed her or gave her a gentle massage — a sign that people's concentration improved without an increase in stress.
After all eight activities, the participants reported feeling less stressed, fatigued and depressed.
In particular, massaging Aro, feeding her treats and hugging her improved people’s moods, according to the surveys. Participants also reported feeling comfortable while walking Aro and relaxed while massaging her.
""This study demonstrated that specific dog activities could activate stronger relaxation, emotional stability, attention, concentration, and creativity by facilitating increased brain activity,"" Yoo said. ""In addition, interactions with dogs could decrease stress and induce positive emotional responses.""
Some past research has suggested that dogs could help ease symptoms of depression or post-traumatic stress disorder, but it remains unclear how effective that intervention may be.
A 2022 study found that veterans and first responders who had a service dog experienced fewer PTSD symptoms than those without one — though having a dog as a pet was less effective.
Similarly, a 2020 clinical trial found that service dogs were slightly better at improving PTSD symptoms among veterans compared to emotional support dogs, which weren't trained to perform tasks like turning on lights or retrieving objects. However, both types of dogs improved PTSD symptoms to some extent.
Research also suggests that, for this type of “pet therapy” to have a benefit, people need to like animals in the first place.
“I was actually traumatized at a very young age by a dog. I never quite warmed up to them, so I’m not sure I would necessarily find the same comfort level,"" said Kathryn Magruder, a psychiatry professor at the Medical University of South Carolina and an author of the 2020 trial.
Jennifer Dobkin manages an animal therapy program for medical patients and staff called UCLA People-Animal Connection, and said she has seen how interacting with dogs helps people concentrate and relax.
""If it’s a staff member that’s been stressed and having a bad day, you can physically see their posture relaxes. They smile. They’ll say things to us like, ‘You have no idea how much I needed this,'"" she said.
Dobkin said she recently brought her own dog, Toto, a terrier mix, to visit a family in the hospital whose father was dying. Amid the stress and sadness, the family was able to remove themselves from that headspace and ""focus on something that requires absolutely nothing from them: petting a dog,"" she said.
Children at Stuart House — a center in Santa Monica, California, that provides medical treatment and forensic services for sexually abused youth — also prefer to pet a Golden Retriever/Labrador mix named Norse while they're talking to investigators, Dobkin said.
""Our dogs get called to those situations to help the kids cope with talking about a really, really stressful situation that happened to them,"" she said. ""I think it does help them concentrate. It just provides a sense of comfort.""

2024-02-01T21:18:07.061Z,"A stealthy cholesterol is killing people, and most don't know they're at risk",NBC News,"Millions of Americans are born genetically predisposed to extremely high levels of a type of cholesterol that cause deadly heart attacks and strokes by middle age, yet they are almost always unaware of their risk.
The cholesterol is called lipoprotein(a), or Lp(a). Like low-density lipoprotein — LDL, or the ""bad"" cholesterol — it leads to plaque buildup in arteries. But Lp(a) has a second nasty trick that makes it even more dangerous: it causes blood clots. And unlike LDL, it's entirely genetic, which means diet and exercise have no effect on Lp(a) levels.
The result is a high likelihood of life-threatening heart disease that runs in families, killing parents, aunts, uncles and siblings in their 40s and 50s.
""Everybody in their family has had a heart attack or stroke or bypass surgery or stent in their 40s,"" Dr. Steven Nissen, chief academic officer of the Heart, Vascular & Thoracic Institute at Cleveland Clinic, said of his patients with high Lp(a). ""They're scared to death.""
As many as 64 million Americans have elevated Lp(a) levels. Anyone can have it, though it is most common among people of African and South Asian descent.
Routine blood cholesterol tests could look for Lp(a) but do not — largely because there is no effective treatment for it. Similar to other forms of high cholesterol, there are no symptoms with high Lp(a).
But with several promising drugs making their way through clinical trials, doctors say people should be aware of their risk.
Dr. Erin Michos said screening for Lp(a) is part of her preventive care for patients.
""To me, it doesn't make any sense that I'm not going to measure it just because I can't bring the number down,"" said Michos, an associate professor of medicine and director of Women's Cardiovascular Health Research at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore. ""I measure it in all my patients at least once to just find out who's high because we can do things to lower their risk.""
Cardiologist Dr. Sahil Parikh believes there should be wider testing for Lp(a).
""The challenge has been, if you test for something and don't have a treatment for it, are you doing the patient any favors?"" said Parikh, director of endovascular services at Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York. ""I used to not test for things that I couldn't treat. But now I do, because I know on the horizon, we're going to have good treatments. It gives patients hope.""
One of those experimental drugs is called pelacarsen, from drugmaker Novartis. Earlier studies showed it significantly drove down Lp(a) levels in 98% of people taking it. The question for researchers now is whether a lower Lp(a) actually reduces early and potentially deadly heart attacks and stroke. It's already well established that medications such as statins can protect against heart disease by lowering LDL.
Lori Welsh, 51, of Dublin, Ohio, is betting on pelacarsen to work. High Lp(a) levels have run in her family for years, with devastating effects.
""If you go back five generations in my mom's family, everybody died of a heart attack or stroke. Nobody made it past the age of 54,"" Welsh said.
Welsh was only 47 when she had a heart attack.
""I was driving down a six-lane highway in Columbus, Ohio, and I felt pressure in my chest. My hands went numb.""
She had a 90% blockage in her heart's biggest artery: the lower anterior descending artery. The condition is known as a ""widow-maker.""
""You go from a perfectly healthy person on a Monday, have a heart attack on a Tuesday, and on Wednesday, you have a heart history that you didn’t have before,"" Welsh said. ""Then you find out that there's no easy fix for this.""
Welsh is participating in a clinical trial of pelacarsen at the Ohio University Wexner Medical Center, one of hundreds of study sites nationwide. Neither she nor her doctors know whether she's getting the real drug or a placebo. She said she has not felt any side effects since enrolling in the trial.
Four other drugs that target Lp(a) are in various stages of research. Early results for Eli Lilly's drug, lepodisiran, show the drug can drive down Lp(a) by more than 94%. Amgen said its drug, olpasiran, has shown similar results. And Silence Therapeutics is studying a drug called zerlasiran. All of those, including pelacarsen, are given as an injection. Eli Lilly is also testing an oral drug called muvalaplin.
The first real-world results for pelacarsen are not expected until next year.
Until the drugs are proven to work, doctors can only treat patients' other heart disease risk factors, such as blood pressure management and statins to bring down other forms of cholesterol.
Dr. Wesley Milks, a cardiologist and clinical assistant professor of internal medicine at The Ohio State University College of Medicine, said he sees patients ""who are aware of their family history and are really trying to prevent a first heart attack or stroke.""
In those cases, he said that doctors might start patients on ""statins earlier in life that we might otherwise.""
""The hope is that we can keep them safe until we can get one of these drugs on the market,"" Nissen, who is an investigator for clinical trials of lepodisiran, said. He and other cardiologists are calling for widespread screening of Lp(a).
The test only needs to be given once during a person’s life because the level never changes.
""Why wait for those new drugs?"" said Michos of Johns Hopkins. Measuring Lp(a) now ""identifies a high-risk patient. We can be proactive about prevention. We can take action.""
That is, maintaining a normal weight, getting regular exercise, stopping smoking and eating a diet rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains are effective ways of managing heart risks overall, even for people with elevated Lp(a), Michos said.
Lori Welsh is convinced that knowing one's own Lp(a) can be life-saving, even if drugs to treat it don't yet exist. Welsh's mother had the first of three heart attacks in her late 40s. Doctors tested her Lp(a) levels and explained how they  greatly elevated her heart risks.
""I saw her be more intentional with her diet and with exercise,"" Welsh said, adding that her mother paid close attention to any heart symptoms from then on. She ultimately lived well into her 70s, decades longer than her ancestors.
""The only difference between her and all five of those generations was the knowledge that she had lipoprotein(a),"" Welsh said. ""That made all the difference.""

2024-01-19T03:25:59.810Z,Costco charcuterie meats linked to salmonella outbreak that has sickened dozens,NBC News,"Charcuterie meats sold at Costco and Sam's Club have been linked to a salmonella outbreak across the U.S., according to the CDC.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been investigating the outbreak across 22 states since Jan. 5. In its Thursday update, 23 new illnesses were added to the tally, totaling 47 cases since the investigation began.
Ten people have been hospitalized from the outbreak, according to the CDC.
The CDC is cautioning consumers from eating certain charcuterie products sold at Costco and Sam's Club.
The Busseto brand ""Charcuterie Sampler,"" which contains prosciutto, sweet soppressata and dry coppa and is sold at Sam's Club, should be avoided, no matter the lot code, the CDC said. The meats come in a twin-pack of two 9-ounce packages.
Also to be avoided is the Fratelli Beretta brand ""Antipasto Gran Beretta"" sold at Costco, the CDC said. The package, also a twin-pack containing two 12-ounce packages, contains black pepper coated dry salami, Italian dry salami, dry coppa and prosciutto. Any lot code of these packages could be contaminated.
Consumers who bought these products should throw them away without eating them, the CDC said. The agency also said businesses should refrain from serving and selling the products. If these products touched any surfaces or containers, they should be washed with hot soapy water or put in the dishwasher.
Investigators are looking into whether any other products might be contaminated, the CDC said.
The CDC said in a news release that the updated information came from interviews with people who got sick after eating the meats. Four people interviewed bought Fratelli Beretta brand products before getting sick. Three others bought the Busseto brand sampler and an additional two people said they bought charcuterie meats from Sam's Club but couldn't remember the brand name.
Symptoms of Salmonella usually start anywhere from six hours to six days after ingesting the bacteria. Symptoms include diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps.

2024-02-13T18:50:03.253Z,Familiar scents unlock memories in people with depression. Could 'smell therapy' help patients?,NBC News,"Study after study has shown that people with depression have trouble recalling specific memories.
They might hear the word ""party,"" for instance, and think, ""I don’t get invited to parties often."" By contrast, someone without depression could hear the word ""party"" and immediately recall a childhood birthday or recent celebration at a friend’s house.
“It’s not that depressed patients don’t have memories — it’s that they’re having trouble accessing them,"" said Kymberly Young, an associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh.
Young may have found a key: A study published Tuesday in JAMA Network Open from her and her team suggests that familiar scents could help unlock those memories.
In the study, people with depression recalled more specific memories when they were exposed to familiar scents — such as ground coffee or tobacco — than when they heard words that corresponded to those smells, such as ""coffee"" or ""cigarette.""
The findings suggest that smell therapy could help people with depression avoid overthinking, she said.
Being able to recall specific memories ""is associated with better problem-solving skills and better emotional regulation,"" Young said.
The study included 32 adults with clinical depression. Participants were asked to sniff 24 odor samples from glass jars, which could be pleasant, neutral or unpleasant. The scents included orange, lavender, vanilla extract, cumin, whiskey, red wine, ketchup, cough syrup, disinfectant and shoe polish.
Participants were then asked to share a specific memory from their life in response to those cues. The researchers conducted the same exercise using 24 words that described each smell.
Around 68% of the participants could recall specific memories in response to the odors, whereas only 52% could recall specific memories after hearing words out loud. Memories triggered by smells were also more vivid than memories triggered by words.
""It was more like you were reliving that memory"" through a smell, Young said.
Odors also produced more positive memories than words did, though the finding wasn’t statistically significant, meaning it could've been due to chance. Young said her research team is still trying to determine why there might be an association between certain smells and positive memories for people with depression.
Many studies have already identified a link between odor and memory in healthy people, said Vidya Kamath, a neuropsychologist at Johns Hopkins Medicine who wasn’t involved in the new research.
“What this study expanded on is the inclusion of depressive symptoms,"" she said.
There's also a well-established link between losing one's sense of smell and depression. A reduced sense of smell could increase the risk of depression, and late-in-life depression in particular. In a survey of more than 300 people who reported some smell loss due to Covid, 43% of participants said they felt depressed.
“We think about reduced smell ability being associated with poor quality of life, poor hygiene, increased loneliness, as well as weight loss. All of those things are pathways by which we think about poor smell being linked to depressive symptoms,” Kamath said.
Research has also shown that people with depression are more likely to have a reduced sense of smell (known as olfactory loss), and that depression symptoms tend to get worse the more people's sense of smell diminishes.
“It goes both ways. There are people who have depression and then have olfactory loss, and then there are people who have olfactory loss that adds to the risk for depression,” said Michael Leon, professor emeritus of neurobiology and behavior at the University of California, Irvine, who wasn’t involved with the new study.
Leon said the olfactory system — the body structures, including the nose, that regulate smell — communicates directly with the limbic system, a brain region associated with mood and memory. As a result, smells are more strongly linked to how people process emotions or recall past events compared with other senses like sight or sound.
""The olfactory system is the only sensory system that has a direct, superhighway access to the memory centers of the brain and the emotional centers of the brain. All the other senses have to take the side streets to get there,"" Leon said.
Smell therapy is already being studied as a means to treat depression, he added. A 2017 review found that aromatherapy — exposing people to fragrant essential oils — might help ease depression symptoms. Having people smell multiple odors on a regular basis likely has the same effect, Leon said, though the treatment hasn't been given to patients outside of a research setting yet.
Young's study proposes a slightly different approach: In the future, she said, odors could become a training tool to help people with depression get better at recalling positive life events and tapping into positive emotions. For instance, someone might smell red wine and remember a fun time at a party.
However, Leon questioned if that approach would be more beneficial than ones already being considered.
""People have already improved depression without going through this song and dance about remembering an odor at a party,"" he said. ""It doesn't give you any advantage.""

2024-01-19T20:38:35.788Z,This season's flu is hard on kids. Here's what symptoms doctors are seeing.,NBC News,"The current flu season is shaping up to be a severe one for children.
So far this season, 47 kids and teens have died from the flu, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Friday — a worrisome toll that experts say puts the U.S. on track with what was seen last flu season, a particularly bad one for children that ended with 183 pediatric deaths reported.
""We are probably going to at least meet or exceed that,"" said Dr. Andi Shane, head of pediatric infectious diseases at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta. ""We are seeing quite a notable season in terms of deaths.""
The increase in pediatric deaths comes amid an apparent slowdown in flu activity.
On Friday, the CDC reported that for a second week in a row, the number of people hospitalized for the flu has decreased slightly.
Still, the virus continues to circulate at ""elevated"" levels across most of the country, and the agency warned that it is too soon to say the season has peaked as it continues to watch for another possible rise in spread.
An estimated 180,000 people have been hospitalized so far this season, and 11,000 people have died.
Flu A, particularly H1N1, accounts for the majority of cases, though flu B, which is often more severe in children, is also being reported.
Dr. Kali Broussard, a pediatric infectious diseases specialist at Our Lady of Lourdes Women's and Children's Hospital in Lafayette, Louisiana, said that the majority of children she is seeing with flu have high fevers, of 103 or 104 degrees Fahrenheit, for up to a week.
""This year, it's really the prolonged fevers, dehydration and poor appetite that seem to be getting the best of kids,"" Broussard said.
Children may also experience a sore throat, runny nose, chills and extreme body aches, said Samia Kadri, a lead family nurse practitioner at Banner Urgent Care in Phoenix, Arizona.
""Some are coming in with one or two of those symptoms. Some are coming in with all of those symptoms,"" Kadri said.
Flu patients generally have one thing in common: ""It's how fast that virus hits you. If it hits you hard and fast, it's probably the flu,"" she said.
Sometimes, children develop a severe and painful form of muscle inflammation called myositis. They may feel that they can't walk, and sometimes only want to be carried, Broussard said.
""It's a relatively uncommon side effect of influenza,"" Broussard said, adding that it tends to be more common in males and in influenza B patients. She estimates that it can affect up to 20% of kids during seasons when flu B is spreading widely. It usually resolves within a few days.
But it's dehydration that can send a child into the hospital with the flu. Broussard said the following dehydration signs warrant a doctor's attention:
The annual flu vaccine is recommended for pregnant women, and for children starting at 6 months old. There is still time to get that shot this year, doctors say. While there is no guarantee the shot will protect against infection, it can help reduce the severity of the illness.
Unvaccinated children are often sicker, said Kadri of Banner Urgent Care in Phoenix. ""I find them to be much more ill than my kids who have been vaccinated.""
CORRECTION (Jan. 19, 2024, 5:08 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated the gender most affected by myositis. It is more common in males, not females.

2024-01-11T16:54:42.556Z,Ancient DNA hints at why multiple sclerosis affects so many people of northern European ancestry,NBC News,"Ancient DNA helps explain why northern Europeans have a higher risk of multiple sclerosis than other ancestries: It’s a genetic legacy of horseback-riding cattle herders who swept into the region about 5,000 years ago.
The findings come from a huge project to compare modern DNA with that culled from ancient humans’ teeth and bones — allowing scientists to trace both prehistoric migration and disease-linked genes that tagged along.
When a Bronze Age people called the Yamnaya moved from the steppes of what are now Ukraine and Russia into northwestern Europe, they carried gene variants that today are known to increase people’s risk of multiple sclerosis, researchers reported Wednesday.
Yet the Yamnaya flourished, widely spreading those variants. Those genes probably also protected the nomadic herders from infections carried by their cattle and sheep, concluded the research published in the journal Nature.
“What we found surprised everyone,” said study co-author William Barrie, a genetics researcher at the University of Cambridge. “These variants were giving these people an advantage of some kind.”
It’s one of several findings from a first-of-its-kind gene bank with thousands of samples from early humans in Europe and western Asia, a project headed by Eske Willerslev of Cambridge and the University of Copenhagen who helped pioneer the study of ancient DNA. Similar research has traced even earlier cousins of humans such as Neanderthals.
Using the new gene bank to explore MS was a logical first step. That’s because while MS can strike any population, it is most common among white descendants of northern Europeans and scientists have been unable to explain why.
The potentially disabling disease occurs when immune system cells mistakenly attack the protective coating on nerve fibers, gradually eroding them. It causes varying symptoms — numbness and tingling in one person, impaired walking and vision loss in another — that often wax and wane.
It’s not clear what causes MS although a leading theory is that certain infections could trigger it in people who are genetically susceptible. More than 230 genetic variants have been found that can increase someone’s risk.
The researchers first examined DNA from about 1,600 ancient Eurasians, mapping some major shifts in northern Europe’s population. First, farmers from the Middle East began supplanting hunter-gatherers and then, nearly 5,000 years ago, the Yamnaya began moving in — traveling with horses and wagons as they herded cattle and sheep.
The research team compared the ancient DNA to about 400,000 present-day people stored in a UK gene bank, to see the MS-linked genetic variations persist in the north, the direction the Yamnaya moved, rather than in southern Europe.
In what is now Denmark, the Yamnaya rapidly replaced ancient farmers, making them the closest ancestors of modern Danes, Willerslev said. MS rates are particularly high in Scandinavian countries.
Why would gene variants presumed to have strengthened ancient immunity later play a role in an autoimmune disease? Differences in how modern humans are exposed to animal germs may play a role, knocking the immune system out of balance, said study co-author Dr. Astrid Iversen of Oxford University.
The findings finally offer an explanation for the north-south MS divide in Europe but more work is needed to confirm the link, cautioned genetic expert Samira Asgari of New York’s Mount Sinai School of Medicine, who wasn’t involved with the research, in an accompanying commentary.

2024-02-11T11:00:40.000Z,The threat of fungal infections is growing. Why is it so hard to make new drugs?,NBC News,"Last summer, the Food and Drug Administration denied an application for a new antifungal drug called olorofim, sending it back to the company with a request for more data. If approved, it would have been the first time since the early 2000s that the FDA cleared an antifungal that works in an entirely novel way.
It couldn’t come at a more important time: In recent years, the potential danger fungal infections pose to human health has become more and more apparent, as fungi either evolve to evade treatments or spread beyond their typical geographical regions. Doctors around the world are desperate for new medicines to combat the growing threat.
“The problem with fungal diseases has gotten to the point where the World Health Organization has recognized it as a widespread threat,” said Dr. Arturo Casadevall, a microbiologist and chair of molecular microbiology and immunology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore.
In late 2022, the WHO published its first-ever list of fungal priority pathogens — 19 fungi the agency said pose a significant threat to human health. It includes the highly drug-resistant yeast Candida auris, which infects critically ill hospital patients; in 2021 alone, the number of infections in the U.S. tripled, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Also on the WHO’s list is coccidioides, a fungus that causes an infection called Valley fever. Historically found in the southwestern U.S., scientists have predicted that its range could spread north to the Canadian border and east to the Great Plains by the end of the century.
The situation is complicated by the impact fungi can have on the global food system.
Fungi thrive in soil, and fungal diseases have long been a huge issue in agriculture — as much as one-quarter of the world’s crops are lost to fungal diseases before being harvested. Another 20% succumb to fungi after harvest. Similar to the way doctors use antifungals to treat fungal infections in humans, farmers use fungicides, a type of pesticide, to kill fungal diseases that overtake crops.
But the much-needed fungicides can render critical antifungal drugs useless.
That’s because many fungicides have the same molecular target as antifungal drugs, including existing drugs, as well as some long-awaited new ones that are in the final stages of clinical trials. If a fungus is regularly exposed to fungicide meant to kill it — many fungi that can infect  the human body also thrive in soil and decaying plant matter — it can develop resistance to it. If these mutated fungi then infect humans, they already have the ability to evade the antifungal that targets them.
The above scenario isn’t hypothetical. Scientists have linked commonly used fungicides to increasingly drug-resistant infections of a fungus called Aspergillus fumigatus in 40 countries, including the U.S.
Of particular concern is that the fungus has developed resistance to an entire class of antifungals called azoles, the most commonly prescribed type of drug for fungal infections. In addition to treating a wide range of infections, it’s also the only antifungal that can be taken at home and the only one that can be taken for more than six months, which is often required to fully clear an infection.
“We are down to three classes of antifungals, and one of them is the azoles,” said Norman Van Rhijn, a research fellow in the Manchester Fungal Infection Group at the University of Manchester in the United Kingdom.
Several new drugs also hang in the balance, including olorofim, which is part of a new class of drugs and that has shown to be effective against the azole-resistant Aspergillus.
“We don’t want to paint this as a conflict of medicine versus agriculture,” said Leah Cowen, a professor of molecular genetics at the University of Toronto.“It’s not that we need antifungals for one over the other, we need both, but with different targets.”
Humans are much more closely related to fungi than we are to bacteria and viruses: We share about half of our DNA with fungi, and many proteins that are essential for fungi to survive are also essential for human cells.
That makes it very difficult to find a molecular target in a fungal cell that can be attacked without also causing severe damage to a human cell, which is why a lot of antifungals have serious side effects, Van Rhijn said.
On top of that, fungi can develop resistance to a drug very quickly.
Like viruses and bacteria, they have the innate ability to reproduce quickly and mutate, and those mutations can lead to strains that render drugs ineffective.
This also happens in the world of bacteria and antibiotics — antibiotic resistance is another major public health threat — but doctors still have many more antibiotics to choose from.
“We only have three major classes of antifungal drugs to treat invasive infections compared to several dozen classes of antibacterials,” Cowen said.
The ones that are available are less than perfect as it is, she added. “Some are toxic, some are susceptible to resistance and some have a limited spectrum of activity.”
Anna Selmecki, an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Minnesota Medical School, was blunt about the dire need for more drugs that can effectively combat fungi.
“I’m concerned that many patients will die because our current set of antifungal drugs are limited and more fungi are resistant to the few antifungal drugs available,” Selmecki said.
It takes about 25 years to develop a new antifungal drug, and a similarly long time to create a new fungicide, Van Rhijn said. Scientists have so far identified only a handful of viable molecular targets in fungal cells, and they’re often the same target used in both antifungal drugs and fungicides.
In the case of the new drug olorofim, it’s a fungicide called ipflufenoquin — used on fruit and nut trees and in vineyards. The Environmental Protection Agency, which reviews and approves pesticides independently of the FDA, cleared ipflufenoquin as a fungicide nearly two years ago.
Since the FDA requested more data on olorofim from British drugmaker F2G, Inc., the novel antifungal has been in phase 3 clinical trials. Studies so far have shown the drug to be effective against the fungus that causes Valley fever, as well as a rare emerging fungal infection called lomentosporiosis that’s been linked to organ transplants.
“Olorofim is probably the most promising antifungal,” said Dallas Smith, an epidemiologist with the Mycotic Diseases Branch of the CDC, noting that the drug has shown to be effective against “almost every single fungal infection.”
Both treatments have the same target: an enzyme called dihydroorotate dehydrogenase.
According to Van Rhijn, there are other antifungal drugs in the pipeline that are following the same trajectory as olorofim. He worries that a novel antifungal called fosmanogepix, which has not yet been FDA-approved, could be threatened by a pesticide called aminopyrifen — effective against a type of fungi that invades soft fruit like strawberries — that works on the same target.
Cowen agreed.
“The same story is playing out again,“ she said.
Competition with fungicides is not the only issue driving antifungal drug resistance. Poor diagnostic tests, little surveillance of infections and drug misuse — fungal infections are often misdiagnosed — all play a role as well, but more coordinated oversight of new drugs and pesticides and their targets is going to play a significant role in preserving the effectiveness of antifungals moving forward. This means regulatory agencies like the FDA and the EPA will need to work together when approving new drugs and fungicides.
“We need to balance the global food supply with human antifungals, and we need more cooperation with that,” Smith said.
With careful planning, there will be room for both olorofim and ipflufenoquin, as well as other antifungals and fungicides with the same targets, he said. “We know that not all infections will be inherently resistant to the older antifungal medications.”
In September, the EPA announced it was working with the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Agriculture on a potential framework that would better safeguard antifungals. The agency expects to finalize the framework by the end of this year, Remmington Belford, the EPA press secretary, told NBC News in an emailed statement.
When finalized, the framework will provide guidance for collaboration between the agencies that deal with human health and the EPA, which approves pesticides, and how pesticides can be evaluated for any potential threats to antimicrobial resistance they may pose.
Cowen said that even without such a framework, potentially life-saving antifungals shouldn’t be dropped because of the risks the new fungicides pose to the antifungals’ efficacy.
“We still desperately need this new class of antifungals. Olorofim has great potential to treat fungal infections we currently don’t have treatments for,” she said.

2024-01-27T10:30:40.000Z,"Writing by hand may increase brain connectivity more than typing, readings of student brains suggest",NBC News,"Typing may be faster than writing by hand, but it’s less stimulating for the brain, according to research published Friday in the journal Frontiers in Psychology.
After recording the brain activity of 36 university students, researchers at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology determined that handwriting might improve learning and memory.
At the start of the experiment, the students were told to either write words in cursive using a digital pen on a touchscreen, or to type the same words using a keyboard. When a word such as “forest” or “hedgehog” appeared on a screen in front of them, they had 25 seconds to write or type it over and over.
Meanwhile, a cap of sensors on their head measured their brain waves. The cap’s 256 electrodes attached to the scalp and recorded the electrical signals of the students’ brains, including where brain cells were active and how parts of the brain communicated with each other.
“Our main finding was that handwriting activates almost the whole brain as compared to typewriting, which hardly activates the brain as such. The brain is not challenged very much when it’s pressing keys on a keyboard as opposed to when it’s forming those letters by hand,” said Audrey van der Meer, the study’s co-author and a neuropsychology professor at NTNU.
In particular, the study found that writing by hand required communication between the brain’s visual, sensory and motor cortices. People who wrote with the digital pen had to visualize letters, then use their fine motor skills to control their movement when writing.
“When you have to form letters by hand, an ‘A’ will look completely different than a ‘B’ and requires a completely different movement pattern,” van der Meer said.
By contrast, when typing, the keys look mostly the same, regardless of the letter. As a result, the study found, typing required less brain activity in the visual and motor cortices.
“Because only small parts of the brain are active during typewriting, there is no need for the brain to communicate between different areas,” van der Meer said.
Van der Meer’s previous research in children and young adults similarly found that people’s brains are more active while writing by hand than while typing. A 2017 study from Indiana University also indicated that writing by hand could link visual and motor skills, which might help kids better recognize letters.
But so far, there’s mixed evidence as to whether taking notes on paper versus a laptop can help people remember and understand information better in the classroom or raise their performance on tests.
It’s also hard to know whether or how the brain activity in the new study might translate into real-life improvements in learning or memory, said Ramesh Balasubramaniam, a neuroscientist at the University of California, Merced, who wasn’t involved in the research.
The study showed that when students write by hand, “a lot of the connections are happening from the frontal and temporal regions of the brain, which are more memory-related,” he said. But a future study could actually “test the participants for what they remember from things that they hand-wrote and what they typed.”
Balasubramaniam said older adults might also see cognitive benefits from handwriting, “but I think the largest benefits are when the brain is still developing, because it kind of coincides with other major learning processes that are happening.”
In the United States, the Common Core set of academic standards, adopted by most states, calls for kids to learn handwriting in kindergarten and first grade. It also sets typing milestones for fourth, fifth and sixth graders.
“Kids are currently being taught handwriting. They will always be taught handwriting. How much they actually use handwriting is going to be a mixture of their own personal preferences and then the expectations of the classrooms that they’re in,” said Morgan Polikoff, an associate professor of education at USC Rossier School of Education.
Writing by hand can be more beneficial for some children than others, he added.
“Some kids maybe have fine motor issues, so handwriting will be a challenge for them,” Polikoff said. On the other hand, “there’s some evidence that handwriting, especially cursive handwriting, works especially well for students with dyslexia.”
The U.S. has seen some political pressure to require cursive in schools. California, for example, passed a law last year mandating that public school teachers give some cursive instruction from first through sixth grade. Polikoff estimated that roughly 20 states have some sort of cursive requirement.
But scientists don’t know if cursive offers any additional cognitive benefits over writing in print.
Polikoff said some people support teaching cursive simply because historical documents were written that way, people traditionally sign their names in cursive or just that “it’s a lovely dying art.”
On the other hand, van der Meer said she’s often “accused of wanting to go back to the Stone Age” by advocating for students to write by hand in schools. Both handwriting and typing should have a place in the classroom, she said.
“We live in a digital world and the digital world is here to stay,” van der Meer said. “If you have to write a long essay or a long text, then obviously it’s much better to use a computer.”

2024-01-12T20:01:44.655Z,"Flu activity dipped slightly nationwide, but experts say the virus isn't done with us yet",NBC News,"As many as 40 children and teenagers, including five babies younger than 5 months old, have died from the flu so far this season, as the virus continues to spread at high levels across most of the United States.
For the first time in months, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Friday a slight dip in how many people are getting the flu or being hospitalized from it, although experts warn that the virus isn't done yet.
The latest numbers are from the first week in January, and may simply reflect that schools were closed and that people tend to be less likely to see their doctor over the holidays.
""A lot of times after a one- or two-week decrease around the holidays, we see a pickup in activity again,"" said Alicia Budd, head of the CDC's domestic influenza surveillance team. That occurred during the 2019-2020 season, when the flu dropped around the same time, but then spiked two more times, in February and March.
""It is too early to know whether activity has peaked for the season,"" Budd said.
As of Friday, the CDC estimates that the flu has sickened 14 million people so far, with 150,000 flu-related hospitalizations and 9,400 deaths.
There were at least 13 pediatric deaths from the flu reported last week. Based on prior CDC reports, the number of children who have died so far this season is likely an undercount.
While the elderly are most likely to be hospitalized with the flu, Dr. Dhaval Desai, director of Hospital Medicine at Emory Saint Joseph’s Hospital in Atlanta, said he’s seeing severe cases among all ages.
""It's not always necessarily the geriatric, older patients,” he said. “I’ve had quite a few younger patients in their 20s to 40s admitted with flu.”
Dehydration, wheezing, severe head and muscle aches and ""high fevers that are staying high, above 104,"" are the main symptoms driving people to the hospital, Desai said.
Shortness of breath sent Quenten Thomas of Maryville, Tennessee, to the hospital last week. The normally energetic, outgoing 27-year-old was unable to get enough air into his lungs.
""It hurt when he coughed,"" his father, Robert Thomas, said. ""He was having trouble catching his breath.”
Quenten Thomas, a father of three young children, had to be put on a ventilator but his condition deteriorated quickly. He died from flu complications Jan. 6. He had not received the flu shot this year.
""I'm still in shock,"" Robert Thomas said, urging people to take the flu more seriously. ""I know I will for the rest of my life.""
""The biggest thing we're seeing right now is fevers,"" said Dr. Rachael Lee, an associate professor in the division of infectious diseases at the University of Alabama, Birmingham, ""as well as fatigue and significant body aches.""
Some have reported unusually severe symptoms, even if they've been vaccinated. Desai said he caught the flu in early November, a full month after his flu shot.
He had a high fever, sweats, cough, sore throat and crushing fatigue. He became so dehydrated that he ended up in the emergency room.
Those intense symptoms are hallmarks of how the flu can cause widespread inflammation in the body, putting the “whole body in a stress state,” Desai said.
Fevers of at least 103 degrees that carry on for several days, as well as signs of severe dehydration, also require medical attention, doctors said.
""If you're having difficulty breathing, that would be an indication to seek emergency care,"" said Dr. Andi Shane, head of pediatric infectious diseases at Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta.
A sign of dangerous dehydration is feeling ""dizzy when you stand up and so weak that you can't walk from one side of the room to the other,"" Desai said.
People may also develop an intense headache.
Anyone ages 6 months and older can still get vaccinated. While it typically takes two weeks after vaccination to build strong immunity, the flu season can last until spring.
""Even if we have peaked, we still have half the season to go,"" CDC's Budd said.
The shot, she said, seems to be a good match to the circulating flu strains.
On Thursday, researchers in Canada reported that the shot is 61% effective in protecting against the predominant strain: H1N1. Among children ages 9 and younger, effectiveness rose to 74%.
Unfortunately, the number of people getting vaccinated this year is down, including pregnant women who are highly vulnerable to serious illness and children, based on early data.
An estimated 10 million fewer people — including children and adults — got their flu shots so far compared to the same time last year, according to the CDC.
""There is some degree of vaccination fatigue in the community,"" Desai said.
The majority of his patients hospitalized with flu this season, he said, have not had the flu shot.
While the vaccine does not necessarily prevent a person from getting infected with the flu, experts maintain that it can reduce the severity and length of the illness.
""The flu vaccine is not a particularly good vaccine at preventing flu,"" said Dr. Bruce Farber, chief of public health and epidemiology at Northwell Health in New York. ""But it's a very good vaccine for preventing people from winding up in a hospital or being ill or dying of flu.""
While the flu has been spreading rapidly over the last few weeks, Shane said, the new numbers are generally in line with previous, typical flu seasons.
“I think that we are returning to the pre-pandemic flu season,” she  said. “If we look and compare what happened last season compared with this season, we do seem to be trending towards our more normal seasonality.”

2024-02-28T22:28:24.503Z,FDA says chemicals in pizza boxes and popcorn bags no longer used in food packaging,NBC News,"Chemicals once commonly found in a range of products, including pizza boxes and microwave popcorn bags, are no longer being used in food packaging in the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday.
Eliminating the grease-proofing substances ends a yearslong campaign by the agency to phase out per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, toxic chemicals that may be linked to serious health problems, including cancer, birth defects and immune system suppression.
PFAS create a barrier that prevents oils, greases and water from seeping through food packaging, keeping the food dry and fresh.
They were once unavoidable in people’s day-to-day lives, being used in everything from fast-food wrappers to pet food bags.
Following extensive research over the last decade that found the chemicals can leach into food and may be associated with serious health problems in humans, food manufacturers gradually began to phase them out. In 2020, the FDA said it received commitments from the remaining food manufacturers to remove PFAS from their products voluntarily over the next few years.
“The completion of the voluntary market phase-out of these substances used on food packaging paper and paperboard, eliminates the primary source of dietary exposure to PFAS from authorized food contact uses,” the FDA said in the release Wednesday.
It's been a drawn-out process; the possible health risks of PFAS have been known — and debated — for years.
In 2015, 200 scientists signed the Madrid Statement, urging manufacturers to find safer alternatives to PFAS, noting that the chemicals may harm humans and the environment.
A recent study published in The Lancet's eBioMedicine found that PFAS may be associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, PFAS can be found in the blood of people and animals, and some PFAS can build up in people with repeated exposure over time.

2024-02-06T22:44:31.986Z,North Carolina mom says pharmacy gave her 5-year-old too-high dosage of ADHD medication,NBC News,"A North Carolina woman said a pharmacy error sickened her daughter because the girl received the wrong dosage of a liquid medication used to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD.
The woman said she filed a complaint with the North Carolina Board of Pharmacy after the 5-year-old girl was given 5 daily milliliters of Quillivant XR instead of the 1 daily milliliter recommended by a doctor.
The news was first reported Sunday by NBC affiliate WXII of Winston-Salem, North Carolina.
The state agency confirmed that a complaint had been filed.
The woman said her daughter was admitted to the emergency room because of side effects from the higher dosage.
Quillivant XR is approved for people 6 and older starting at 4 milliliters per dose, so the prescription was most likely given off-label. The girl's mother said her daughter is underweight for her age.
She said that she reported the error to Walgreens and that a pharmacist told her that she was rushing because of limited staffing and misread the order.
Walgreens told NBC News it couldn’t comment on specific cases, citing patient confidentiality laws.
“In the event of any prescription error, our first concern is always for a patient’s well-being. Our multi-step procedure includes several safety checks to minimize the chance of human error and we have reviewed this process with our pharmacy staff in order to prevent such occurrences,” the company said in a statement.
The Food and Drug Administration receives more than 100,000 annual reports of medication errors — preventable events, such as prescribing the wrong dosage, that could harm patients or lead to inappropriate use of drugs.
A study last year found that 7,000 to 9,000 people in the U.S. die from medication errors every year and that hundreds of thousands more have adverse reactions or complications that aren’t reported.
Potential dosing errors are most likely common, said Adam Bursua, a clinical assistant professor at the University of Illinois Chicago College of Pharmacy.
Bursua said liquid medications are especially prone to dosing errors because they are prescribed in either milligrams or milliliters — and those figures, in turn, are based on people’s weight in kilograms or pounds. That creates room for basic arithmetic or transcription errors, he said.
“Any time humans are involved with transcribing or having to type or calculate on their own, it introduces a new opportunity for human error to sneak in,” Bursua said.
Rita Jew, the president of the Institute for Safe Medication Practices, a nonprofit group that aims to prevent medication errors, said many doctors’ offices and pharmacies don’t use the same electronic systems, so ""sometimes the prescription will be dumped into miscellaneous fields"" and the pharmacist will have to re-input it manually.
There’s also the issue of confirmation bias: Pharmacists may look for dosage that make sense to them rather than ones tailored to individual patients. Jew said many pharmacies don’t know patients’ ages or weights, meaning ""sometimes you just don't have the right information to even know that a dose is incorrect.""
On top of that, she said, the workload is often overwhelming: A 2019 survey from the Department of Health and Human Services found that pharmacy staff members commonly feel rushed processing prescriptions and that interruptions and distractions in pharmacies make it difficult to work accurately.
Bursua said pharmacists face mounting hurdles trying to get medications covered by insurance. And Jew said the Covid pandemic made vaccinations at pharmacies more common, adding strain on pharmacists.
“You can have a patient walk in and want their vaccine when your phone is ringing off the hook and you have prescriptions waiting to be filled and you have people standing in line,” Jew said.
The Institute for Safe Medication Practices recommends that pharmacies dedicate periods of time to administering vaccines, rather than try to dispense medications simultaneously.
It also has a few tips for patients to reduce the likelihood of medication errors. To start, people should find out the generic and brand names of their medications, how to take them and what dosages they’re supposed to receive. From there, they can check the medicine labels to make sure the information is correct.
The institute also suggests bringing a copy of your prescription to the pharmacy. If the medication is new, speak with a pharmacist to go over the prescribing information. Most prescription labels will describe the appearance of the medication itself, so you can verify that the description matches what’s inside the box.
“Somewhere on the label, it should describe the color, the shade and any imprints on these tablets or capsules,” Jew said. “That’s a very important step to double-check.”
Finally, the institute suggests using the same pharmacy to fill medications. That will make it easier for pharmacists to flag any potential allergies or drug interactions based on your history.

2024-02-28T16:37:18.616Z,"Months after applesauce recall, parents remain in constant fear about possible long term effects",NBC News,"About four months after WanaBana announced a nationwide recall of its cinnamon applesauce pouches, parents of lead-poisoned children say they’re still living in constant fear of the potential long-term health issues that could develop in their young ones.
Alyssa Magnuson, 29, from Braham, Minnesota, was in “disbelief and shock” when a routine blood test last fall revealed that her then-11-month-old daughter's blood lead levels were 23.4 micrograms of lead per deciliter, far higher than what’s seen in most children.
“I literally didn’t think there was any possible way lead could have gotten into her system,” Magnuson said.
It wasn’t until a week later that she learned about the WanaBana recall. Magnuson had bought the applesauce pouches from a Dollar Tree store, something she said other people judged her for at the time.
Magnuson said that her daughter, Stevie, began acting fussy around the time she started eating the applesauce, something Magnuson now attributes to lead exposure.
“Now that her lead levels are lower, she’s acting entirely differently,” she said.
But the worry and guilt haven’t gone away.
“It’s always going to be a thing,” Magnuson said. “If something’s wrong with her when she’s older, I’m gonna wonder if it’s that.”
Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., said that the WanaBana contamination is ""absolutely outrageous"" and has renewed her call on the Food and Drug Administration to take action on heavy metals in foods for babies and young children.
“This is heavy metals that are ingested by toddlers, by little kids,” Klobuchar said in an interview. “You think you’re safe when you use a cinnamon-flavored applesauce pack. And it turns out, you’re basically giving your child poisons.”
She plans to introduce a bill that would call for inspections on food imports meant for babies and young children and said that going forward, there need to be changes to laws that have restricted the FDA from taking action against foreign food manufacturers that don't meet the agency's standards for safety.
A spokesperson for the FDA said the agency “takes seriously its responsibility to ensure the safety of the foods made available to U.S. consumers.”
“The agency continues to use all available authorities and work closely with international partners to safeguard the complex, global food supply chain,” the spokesperson said.
WanaBana announced a recall of its apple cinnamon pouches in late October, after detecting elevated lead levels in the children’s food. The following month, in November, the recall was expanded to include two other products made by the company: the supermarket brands Schnucks applesauce pouches with cinnamon and Weis cinnamon applesauce.
As of Feb. 23, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has received 468 confirmed, probable and suspected reports of elevated blood lead levels linked to the pouches across 44 states.
The FDA, which is investigating the source of the lead, said it has identified cinnamon as the likely source of contamination, tracing it back to a single cinnamon processor in Ecuador. WanaBana did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
There is no known safe blood lead level in children, said Dr. Laura Breeher, an occupational and environmental medicine physician at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. The CDC uses a level of 3.5 micrograms per deciliter to identify kids with higher blood lead levels than most.
Lead exposure can cause a large variety of symptoms, Breeher said, including:
It can also cause damage to the brain and nervous system, slowed growth and issues with hearing and speech, and lower IQ, according to the CDC. How long — and how much — lead exposure it takes before a child develops these issues is still an open question.
Breeher said some children may show no symptoms, underscoring the importance of parents getting their children’s blood lead levels tested. Some may not develop symptoms until much later, she said.
Sarah Callahan, 39, of Port Republic, Maryland, said doctors told her that her 18-month-old son, Rudy, is showing signs of a speech delay.
Callahan said she had no idea Rudy had been exposed to lead until a blood test last fall during his one-year check-up. His blood lead levels were 19.8 micrograms of lead per deciliter. He had been eating the WanaBana pouches since the spring.
As of early February, Callahan said that Rudy’s blood lead levels are trending downward, now at 5.7 micrograms. Callahan said she worries about the possibility of his levels spiking again or another health issue emerging.
“With his lead poisoning, it’s just like, his development at any point could stop or be delayed because of it,” said Callahan, who filed a lawsuit against WanaBana USA in November. “It’s always a worry, always a fear. But we’re trying to live in the present and just take one day at a time.”
Courtney Akin, 30, of Folkston, Georgia, has also noticed signs of a speech delay in her 18-month-old son, Jaxson.
Akin first purchased WanaBana applesauce pouches from a Dollar Tree store in July. In September, a test revealed Jaxson’s blood lead levels were 5.2 micrograms of lead per deciliter. (A spokesperson for Dollar Tree has previously said the retailer has since removed the product from its shelves and locked registers to prevent sales.)
It wasn’t until the recall, however, that Akin realized Jaxson’s elevated blood levels could be linked to the applesauce and she removed them from his diet. She still feels an immense amount of guilt about feeding her son the pouches and remains concerned about health issues in the future.
“It’s very scary,” Akin said. “Working as hard as I did nursing him that long, and then I go and purchase lead pouches. I feel terrible that I fed that to my son.”
Not all parents have noticed symptoms in their children.
Mariah Piazza, 27, of Tonawanda, New York, said her 1-year-old son, Caiden, appears to be doing well after he stopped eating the applesauce pouches.
Caiden had been eating the cinnamon applesauce pouches almost every day for about a month. Last March, a blood test revealed that Caiden had a blood lead level of 13 micrograms per deciliter.
He’s since had several lead tests done and they’ve come back undetectable for lead, she said.
Others have noticed physical symptoms.
Arielle Tevault, 26, of Indianapolis, Indiana, said her 3-year-old son Asher started looking pale and developed dark circles around his eyes around the time he started eating the WanaBana pouches early last year. The dark circles, Tevault said, still haven’t gone away, even several months after he stopped eating them.
“He just looks sick,” said Tevault.
Asher’s blood level levels were at 4.9 micrograms of lead per deciliter in early November, she said, but have since gone down.
Still, Tevault said she’s worried about potential neurological problems. “Theoretically, there could be long-term effects that develop over time,” she said.
She expressed frustration over WanaBana’s marketing of the cinnamon applesauce, which was labeled as gluten and sugar-free and without artificial flavors.
“What do you do as a parent, as a young parent in 2024? The world is falling apart. You can’t even trust the food in stores,” she said.

2024-03-01T18:01:09.307Z,CDC updates Covid isolation guidelines for people who test positive,NBC News,"People who test positive for Covid no longer need to isolate for five days, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday.
The CDC’s new guidance now matches public health advice for flu and other respiratory illnesses: Stay home when you’re sick, but return to school or work once you’re feeling better and you’ve been without a fever for 24 hours.
The shift reflects sustained decreases in the most severe outcomes of Covid since the beginning of the pandemic, as well as a recognition that many people aren’t testing themselves for Covid anyway.
“Folks often don’t know what virus they have when they first get sick, so this will help them know what to do, regardless,” CDC director Dr. Mandy Cohen said during a media briefing Friday.
Over the past couple of years, weekly hospital admissions for Covid have fallen by more than 75%, and deaths have decreased by more than 90%, Cohen said.
“To put that differently, in 2021, Covid was the third leading cause of death in the United States. Last year, it was the 10th,” Dr. Brendan Jackson, head of respiratory virus response within the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said during the briefing.
Many doctors have been urging the CDC to lift isolation guidance for months, saying it did little to stop the spread of Covid.
The experiences of California and Oregon, which previously lifted their Covid isolation guidelines, proved that to be true.
“Recent data indicate that California and Oregon, where isolation guidance looks more like CDC’s updated recommendations, are not experiencing higher Covid-19 emergency department visits or hospitalizations,” Jackson said.
Changing the Covid isolation to mirror what’s recommended for flu and other respiratory illnesses makes sense to Dr. David Margolius, the public health director for the city of Cleveland.
“We’ve gotten to the point where we are suffering from flu at a higher rate than Covid,” he said. “What this guidance will do is help to reinforce that— regardless of what contagious respiratory viral infection you have — stay home when you’re sick, come back when you’re better.”
Dr. Kristin Englund, an infectious diseases expert at the Cleveland Clinic, said the new guidance would be beneficial in curbing the spread of all respiratory viruses.
“I think this is going to help us in the coming years to make sure that our numbers of influenza and RSV cases can also be cut down, not just Covid,” she said.
Still, the decision was likely to draw criticism from some clinicians who point to the fact that the U.S. logged 17,310 new Covid hospitalizations in the past week alone.
“It’s something that is likely to draw a wide array of opinions and perhaps even conflicting opinions,” said Dr. Faisal Khan, Seattle’s director of public health. “But [the CDC’s] rationale is sound in that the pandemic is now in a very different phase from where it was in 2021 or 2022 or 2023.”
Though the isolation guidelines have been wiped away, the CDC still encourages people to play it safe for five days after they are feeling better. That includes masking around vulnerable people and opening windows to improve the flow of fresh air indoors.
The majority of viral spread happens when people are the sickest. “As the days go on, less virus spreads,” Cohen said.
People at higher risk for severe Covid complications, such as the elderly, people with weak immune systems and pregnant women, may need to take additional precautions.
Dr. Katie Passaretti, chief epidemiologist at Atrium Health in Charlotte, said it was a “move in the positive direction.”
“We are continuing to edge into what the world looks like after Covid, with Covid being one of many respiratory viruses that are certain that circulate,” she said.
The new guidance is for the general public only, and does not include isolation guidelines in hospital settings, which is generally 10 days.
On Wednesday, the agency said that adults 65 and older should get a booster shot of the Covid vaccine this spring. It’s anticipated that the nation will experience an uptick in the illness later this summer.
Winter and summer waves of Covid have emerged over the past four years, with cases peaking in January and August, respectively, according to the CDC.
Another, reformulated, shot is expected to be available and recommended this fall.

2024-02-26T14:19:25.693Z,Measles is a 'heat-seeking missile' experts warn as Florida outbreak grows,NBC News,"The Florida measles outbreak is expanding. As of Monday, health officials in Broward County confirmed an eighth case of the virus, including one in a child under age 5.
﻿It’s unknown what connection the youngest measles patient has to Manatee Bay Elementary School in Weston, near Fort Lauderdale, where most of the cases have been identified. The spread beyond school-age kids was expected.
Cases are “not going to stay contained just to that one school, not when a virus is this infectious,” said Dr. David Kimberlin, co-director of the division of pediatric infectious diseases at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that as of Friday there have been at least 35 measles cases in 15 states in 2024 — most related to international travel. In January, there were nine measles cases in Pennsylvania, eight of them in Philadelphia. (If there are no more cases reported there as of early next week, the Philadelphia outbreak will be declared over.) Late Friday, Michigan’s health department announced that it, too, had identified a measles case — its first since 2019.
Florida’s outbreak is the largest in the U.S. right now. And what Florida’s health officials are doing — or not doing — is drawing fire from experts who study the way diseases spread.
Measles is so contagious and has such a long incubation period that the decision of the state’s Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo to let parents decide whether to quarantine their children or let them keep going to school could allow cases to spread, experts warn.
“Measles is the most infectious pathogen in humans that we know of,” said Kimberlin. “It’s like a heat-seeking missile. It will find the people who are not immune, and they’re going to get sick.”
Unvaccinated people have a 90% chance of becoming infected if exposed.
“Epidemiology 101 is identify and isolate,” said Katelyn Jetelina, who tracks illnesses for a website called “Your Local Epidemiologist.” This is especially true for outbreaks of measles, she said, because of how incredibly contagious the virus is and the fact that people who are infected can spread it for up to three weeks.
In a letter sent to parents at the elementary school on Tuesday, Ladapo wrote, “Due to the high immunity rate in the community, as well as the burden on families and educational cost of healthy children missing school, DOH is deferring to parents or guardians to make decisions about school attendance.”
The letter said that parents should watch for symptoms of measles — high fever, rash, red, watery eyes — but did not encourage vaccination.
When Columbus, Ohio, Health Commissioner Dr. Mysheika Roberts was confronted with a surging measles outbreak in 2022, parents in the state also got a letter, with a very different message.
Eighty-five children, mostly unvaccinated toddlers, became infected with measles in central Ohio. Nearly half, 42%, had to be hospitalized.
When the Ohio outbreak began, Roberts advised that unvaccinated children who had been exposed to measles receive one dose of the mumps-measles-rubella (MMR) vaccine as a form of “post-exposure prophylaxis,” she said.
The 21-day quarantine was reduced to just 72 hours for kids who got the shot.
Infectious disease experts told Roberts it could take six months or more to get it under control. She and her team did it in three.
“By February, we were able to declare the outbreak over,” Roberts said.
Roberts attributes that success to sticking with standard public health guidance: identify and isolate patients — and tell the public what to do.
“We were very clear with what we needed to do to try to control this outbreak,” Roberts said.
Ohio's guidance included:
The letter from Columbus public health officials strongly suggested that families comply with the suggested quarantine.
“We did not leave it up to the parents,” Roberts said. “It was not an order, but the way that we wrote the letter, people probably felt like they didn’t have a choice.”
Since the 2022 outbreak, Ohio has reported only one measles case in 2023 and at least one so far in 2024.
An estimated 1 in 5 measles patients is hospitalized, according to the CDC. And one to three out of 1,000 patients will die.
In Florida, dozens of students at the elementary school are vulnerable, and some may have siblings too young to be fully vaccinated. Meanwhile, vaccine exemptions in Florida have been ticking up in recent years, according to CDC data.
During a school board meeting on Wednesday, Broward County Public Schools Superintendent Peter Licata said 33 of the 1,067 Manatee Bay Elementary students are unvaccinated.
Maria Caballero, whose daughter attends Manatee Bay, told NBC News earlier this week that she is keeping the girl out of school for now. She has twin baby boys who were born prematurely and aren’t yet old enough for the first dose of the MMR vaccine, which is given starting at age 1.
“Even though my 10-year-old is fully vaccinated, I am just concerned she will get the virus and bring it home,” said Caballero.
The Florida outbreak comes at a time when the number of national vaccine exemptions has reached an all-time high. A November CDC report found that 3% of children entering kindergarten during the 2022-2023 school year were granted a vaccine exemption from their state. This is the highest exemption rate ever reported in the U.S.
“More and more people are questioning vaccines and why people need vaccines,” said Kimberlin, the University of Alabama doctor. “They’re gonna find out pretty soon.”

2024-03-08T20:48:58.357Z,FDA approves Wegovy to reduce heart attack and stroke risk,NBC News,"The blockbuster weight loss drug Wegovy is now approved to reduce heart disease risk, drugmaker Novo Nordisk said Friday.
The Food and Drug Administration has updated the drug's label, saying that Wegovy can be prescribed to reduce a person's risk of heart attack and stroke, the company said.
Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The change comes after, in a late-stage clinical trial of more than 17,000 adults, Novo Nordisk found that Wegovy cut the risk of cardiovascular events — such as heart attack and stroke — by 20% compared to a placebo. All of the people in the trial were overweight or had obesity, and had a history of heart disease.
The label change could mean that more employers and insurers are persuaded to cover the medication.
Many have been hesitant to cover the pricy drug for weight loss.
Wegovy, along with other weight loss medications, such as Eli Lilly's Zepbound, are typically not covered by insurance; Medicare, by law, is barred from covering them.
The approval, Novo Nordisk said, makes Wegovy the first therapy approved in the United States to help people manage their weight and reduce heart disease risk.
Wegovy contains semaglutide, the same active ingredient found in the popular diabetes drug Ozempic, which is often prescribed off-label for weight loss. Both are manufactured by Novo Nordisk.

2024-01-24T14:58:29.047Z,FDA says cancer treatment CAR-T therapy may increase risk of cancer,NBC News,"The Food and Drug Administration this week told several drugmakers to add a boxed warning — the agency’s strongest safety label — to the prescribing information for a type of cancer treatment called CAR-T therapy, saying the treatment itself may increase a person’s risk of cancer.
Carly Kempler, a spokesperson for the FDA, said that, despite the warning, ""the overall benefits of these products continue to outweigh their potential risks.""
The agency’s decision to update the labels was based on reports of rare blood cancers in patients who had previously gotten CAR-T therapy, Kempler said. As of Monday, the agency had received 25 reports of the blood cancers in CAR-T patients, she said.
Bruce Levine, a professor in cancer gene therapy at the University of Pennsylvania, said that in addition to the reports submitted to the FDA, two abstracts published late last year in the journal Blood also cited a potential cancer risk associated with CAR-T therapy, which likely “forced the FDA’s hand.”
CAR-T — or chimeric antigen receptor T cell — therapy uses a patient’s own immune cells to treat certain blood cancers, such as leukemia, multiple myeloma and lymphoma. It involves harvesting the immune cells — in this case, T cells — then genetically altering them in a lab to make them target cancer cells, and finally reinfusing them back into the patient.
It’s proven to be highly effective in hard-to-treat cases, experts said. In 2022, doctors who had treated two leukemia patients with CAR-T a decade ago said it was fair to say the therapy had cured the patients of the disease.
“This has been a game changer when we think about treating lymphoma and other diseases,” said Dr. Matthew Frigault, the clinical director of the Massachusetts General Hospital Cellular Immunotherapy Program in Boston.
The first CAR-T therapy, Novartis’ drug Kymriah, received FDA approval in 2017. Since then, another five have been approved.
The makers of the drugs  — Bristol Myers Squibb, for Abecma and Breyanzi; Gilead Sciences' Kite Pharma, for Yescarta and Tecartus; Johnson & Johnson's Carvykti; and Novartis, for Kymriah —  received letters from the FDA, stating that they must submit proposed label changes in the next 30 days to note that, in rare cases, CAR-T therapy can increase the risk of rare blood cancers.
If the drugmakers disagree, they can instead submit a rebuttal explaining why a change isn’t needed.
In a statement to NBC News, a spokesperson for Novartis said the company has not found “sufficient evidence” to support a link between cancer and its treatment, which has been used in more than 10,000 patients. However, the spokesperson said, the company will work with the FDA to update its label “appropriately.”
Spokespersons for Johnson & Johnson and Gilead Sciences also said the drugmakers would work with the agency to update their labels.
A spokesperson for Bristol Myers Squibb said the company is evaluating “next steps” following the FDA’s notice, although it has not seen any cancer cases associated with its treatment.
“Patient safety is our top priority,” the spokesperson said.
Still, there’s the question of how CAR-T could cause cancer — if it does at all.
“We actually don’t know whether this is causal, meaning, we don’t know for a fact that the CAR-T cells in the tumor have led to this,” said Frigault, of Mass General.
CAR-T treatments are still relatively new: Frigault noted that the FDA has required that the makers of the products conduct 15-year follow-up studies to assess the potential risk of secondary cancers following treatment. (Secondary cancers are cancers that can arise from treatment.)
The FDA “is not saying that every single one of the cases they’ve reported has clearly shown CAR-T has led to this,” he said, “but more that there may be an association.”
“This is what the FDA does. They look for a signal,” he added.
If CAR-T does cause cancer, the risk is likely very small, said Dr. Hemant Murthy, a hematology-oncology physician at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida.
More than 27,000 doses of CAR-T therapy have been administered in the U.S., according to the FDA.
“I don’t really see this affecting too much of practice,” Murthy said.
Dr. Saad Usmani, a myeloma physician and cell therapist at Memorial Sloan Kettering, said the label change should support physicians’ current practice of discussing with patients the risk of developing secondary cancers following cancer treatment.
Usmani noted that other cancer treatments, such as radiation and chemotherapy, also carry a risk of secondary cancers.
“The change is expected given the recent reports, albeit very low incidence in such cases,” he said.
Dr. Marcela Maus, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and director of the Cellular Immunotherapy Program at Massachusetts General Hospital, said physicians might be more cautious, but it most likely won’t change much in their practice.
“We need to manage the cancer that they have now, so I don’t imagine it being massively different,” she said.

2024-03-11T09:00:43.000Z,"Where's the Narcan? At pharmacies across the U.S., the OTC antidote can be hard to find",NBC News,"It was a glimmer of hope amid America’s raging opioid epidemic. Narcan, the nasal spray that can almost instantaneously reverse a potentially deadly opioid overdose, was going to be available over the counter in stores, easy to find and easy to buy.
With the proliferation of fentanyl in the illegal drug supply, overdose deaths in the U.S. had reached alarming rates and most efforts to stop the crisis were failing.
Narcan needed to be more readily accessible for anyone who might need it to save a friend or even a stranger.
In a long-awaited move, the Food and Drug Administration cleared the antidote for over-the-counter use in March 2023, and in September the $45 two-dose boxes were shipped across the country. Prior to that, Narcan, or naloxone nasal spray, was distributed for free at community health centers and was also available via prescription.
NBC News visited 64 stores in 15 states and Washington, D.C., over three weeks in February looking for over-the-counter Narcan, including major chain drug stores, independent pharmacies, supermarkets, big-box chains, convenience stores and gas stations.
Stores around the country stocked the bright-pink Narcan boxes in different locations: on display on the pharmacy counter; in the pain medication aisle; behind the pharmacy counter; or behind the front register. Some were easy to spot and access. Other times, a customer would have to hunt or ask for help.
In a CVS Pharmacy in a Target outside of Pittsburgh, Narcan was spotted in a locked case on a shelf marked “Covid tests.”
In a Walgreens in Atlanta, it was on the top shelf in a theft-resistant box, obscured by a large metal pole in the aisle.
At a Publix pharmacy in Chattanooga, Tennessee, a Narcan display sat on the pharmacy counter, but it was nearly obscured by a placard warning parents to lock up their medications and pamphlets advertising “Pet meds for less.”
Most major drugstores and big-box store pharmacies NBC News visited carried Narcan, but none of the convenience stores or gas stations did.
“There’s a real inconsistent rollout,” said Maya Doe-Simkins, the co-director of Remedy Alliance, a group that distributes naloxone, the generic version of Narcan, to harm-reduction groups across the country.
Dr. Maryam Jowza, a chronic pain expert at the UNC School of Medicine in North Carolina, said not selling Narcan in gas stations and convenience stores was “a missed opportunity.”
“If one can buy kratom at a gas station, why not Narcan?” Jowza said, referring to the unregulated herbal supplement often used for pain relief.
Jacob Abraham, a pharmacist at Mineral Springs Pharmacy in rural Mineral Springs, North Carolina, said he made sure to stock over-the-counter Narcan when it became available last fall.
“Then it sat on the shelf for so long, we had to send it back, because I have money sitting on the shelf,” Abraham said. Eventually, someone did come in and ask for it. Now, he said, “I keep one on the shelf just in case.”
Alicia House, executive director of Steve Rummler HOPE Network, a harm reduction group in Minnesota, acknowledged that the rollout has been bumpy and that “it’s probably going to take some time” for awareness about the over-the-counter version to build.
When a person overdoses on an opioid, the drug slows down their breathing and heart rate. The person can fall unconscious, become unresponsive and go limp. Their lips, gums or fingertips may take on a blue tinge. It’s possible to choke on vomit, or to stop breathing entirely.
Narcan, when given soon after an overdose begins, reverses these effects rapidly: The person will usually wake up within one to three minutes, according to the FDA. Because the effects of Narcan do not last long, it’s essential to also call 911.
Dr. Steven Maher, an emergency medicine physician at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, said that speed is important when it comes to administering Narcan.
""You start getting brain damage or brain injuries within six minutes of not breathing very well,"" Maher said. ""So typically the sooner, the better.""
Because of that, he added, already having Narcan on hand is key.
“Naloxone works exceptionally well,” said Dr. Scott Hadland, an addiction specialist at Mass General for Children in Boston, using the generic name for the drug. “It acts within minutes to reverse an overdose and save a life.”
But “we need to expand access, which means having it in more people’s hands,” Hadland said.
To be sure, Narcan is selling.
Since the launch of the over-the-counter version last fall, the drug can be purchased at more than 32,000 mass, drug, grocery and online retailers and e-commerce sites, Paul Williams, a senior vice president at Emergent BioSolutions, the maker of Narcan, said in a statement. In 2023, the company distributed more than 20 million doses of the antidote, both over-the-counter and prescription, in the U.S. and Canada, he said.
In the fourth quarter of last year, Emergent reported $111 million in Narcan sales, a 22% increase from the year prior. The increase was mainly driven by sales of the over-the-counter version, the drugmaker said.
Dennis Cauchon, president of Harm Reduction Ohio, a nonprofit group that distributes Narcan for free, said it’s still too early to gauge the impact the over-the-counter version is having on the opioid crisis.
Hadland knows of at least one case where a patient used Narcan bought over the counter to save a friend.
“People are recognizing it as something that everyone should consider carrying with them,” he said. “I think it will save lives.”
Matt Blanchette, a spokesperson for CVS Health, declined to share sales data for over-the-counter Narcan, but said the stores have “ample supply” of the product, located at the front store registers and near the pharmacy.
All CVS pharmacists, Blanchette added, are trained on how Narcan works and can provide counseling to people before they buy it. People can also buy the product at CVS.com.
For a product like Narcan, anonymity is part of access.
The stigma of walking into a brightly lit store and asking the pharmacist or another employee for Narcan behind the counter may be the biggest hurdle.
“They may ask all these invasive, detailed questions like, ‘What’s your name? What do you do? How old are you?’” House said. “Putting it out front, not having it being prescribed, is just taking down more of those stigmas and barriers.”
A Walgreens spokesperson said Narcan is placed behind the front register to ensure it is highly visible to customers. There are also pull cards on shelves in the pain relief aisle. The company, the spokesperson added, is “continually communicating with our field teams to ensure a consistent and proper placement of the product.”
At 16 Walgreens locations in 11 states plus Washington, D.C., NBC News spotted it behind the pharmacy counter, on display by the pharmacy and on the shelf in the pain relief aisle, in addition to behind the front register.
Nearly all stores visited by NBC News priced over-the-counter Narcan at around $45, a lot for many people who use opioids.
As of late February, a handful of stores — including four Publix locations in Florida and one in Chattanooga, Tennessee — priced the product at $49.99. Two Walgreens locations, one in Maryland and one in Florida, sold Narcan for $49.99.
The Walgreens spokesperson said the company was communicating with stores about consistently pricing the product at $44.99.
Publix did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Independent pharmacies may sell the drug at an even higher price, Cauchon said.
To really make a difference, the two-dose packs need to be priced at around $5, he said.
“There are very few reports of people going in and buying” Narcan in Ohio, he said.
“In theory, it’s good. In retrospect, we’ll be happy that this happened as an event in history,” Doe-Simkins said of Narcan’s arrival in stores. “Right now, it’s distracting.”
Hadland said he expects the people who will buy over-the-counter Narcan will be family members of people who use opioids.
“I’ve especially seen this among parents who increasingly want to keep Narcan at home, almost like a fire extinguisher in case of an emergency,” he said.

2024-01-23T17:25:52.074Z,A 22-year-old man who vaped required a double lung transplant: 'He had no idea how bad it was for him',NBC News,"A 22-year-old man received a double lung transplant earlier this month after being on life support for 70 days.
Jackson Allard, a North Dakota resident, went to the emergency room for a stomach ache in October, but was instead admitted to the hospital because his oxygen levels had dipped too low. The news was first reported by Valley News Live based on a GoFundMe page set up by an Allard's family friend.
Doctors in North Dakota diagnosed Allard with parainfluenza, a virus that can cause respiratory infections, which spiraled into pneumonia, then acute respiratory distress syndrome — a life-threatening injury caused by fluid buildup in the lungs.
“When they did X-rays, you couldn’t even see his heart. It was all white. So that means the whole lung was full of fluid,” said Doreen Hurlburt, Allard’s grandmother.
Hurlburt said Allard had used e-cigarettes since he was 16 or 17, but recently started vaping more heavily.
“He had no idea how bad it was for him,” she said. “The day before he was intubated, he said, ‘I had no idea I could get this sick.’”
Scientists still don’t fully understand the association between vaping and lung disease, so it’s unclear what role vaping may have played in Allard’s case. Some studies suggest that using e-cigarettes could make people more susceptible to respiratory tract infections.
Dr. Brian Keller, medical director of the Massachusetts General Hospital Lung Transplantation Program, said studies involving animals and human cells have shown that e-cigarette use can damage blood vessels and cells that line the lungs. But scientists are still trying to narrow in on which compounds in e-cigarettes are the worst for human health.
“There’s actually several that can cause damage,” Keller said. “This includes the nicotine itself, but also the burning of a carrier fluid like propylene glycol or glycerol, as well as the flavoring that a lot of people add to their vaping device.”
Hurlburt said her grandson’s doctors suspected that his use of e-cigarettes prevented him from recovering from his initial viral infection.
“As he was not getting better, they’re like, ‘Well, he vaped and vaping hurts your lungs,’” she said.
Allard's mother, Jaime Foertsch, said her son was placed on a life-support device called extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or ECMO, then airlifted to M Health Fairview in Minnesota at the end of October.
Foertsch said Allard was the longest patient that M Health Fairview had ever kept on an ECMO machine, which adds oxygen to the blood and sends it back to the body. A hospital representative declined to comment on Monday, citing the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, which safeguards patient privacy.
To be considered for a transplant, Allard needed to come off sedation and be able to walk. But at the end of last year, he was struggling to survive: Doctors had to replace parts of his ECMO device twice due to blood clots forming, which could have been fatal. Then on Dec. 12, he went into cardiac arrest and had to be resuscitated.
“In several family meetings the [Surgical Intensive Care Unit] team said there was a 1% chance of survival,” Foertsch said in an email. “We never gave up and kept advocating for Jackson.”
By the end of the month, Allard had improved and was able to stand and take a few steps, his family said.
“All of a sudden, it just turned around,” Hurlburt said. “It was just like day and night.”
On New Year’s Eve, Foertsch got the call that doctors had allocated a pair of new lungs to her son. Allard received a transplant the next day. By Jan. 5, he no longer required life support.
Allard is still on a ventilator in the ICU, his mother said, but he’s able to get in and out of bed with some help and walk about 5 feet with a walker.
“The nurses are calling him a legend and a miracle,” Foertsch said. “He is getting stronger every day and hopes he will be moved to rehab soon.”
Hurbult said her grandson still needs to re-learn how to talk, but he’s able to communicate.
“He thanked the nurses for all the help,” she said. “He just said, ‘Thanks for working so hard to save me.’ He’s a sweet kid.”
Lung transplants are relatively rare, and even rarer for people under age 50. Out of 2,569 lung transplants performed in the U.S. in 2021, just 440 were in recipients ages 18 to 49. Most vaping-related lung injuries don’t require a transplant, but patients typically need some type of respiratory support like supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation.
“I’ve only been able to come across a couple of reports of patients requiring lung transplant after vaping,” Keller said.
A 17-year-old boy in Michigan who received a transplant in 2019 is believed to be the first case. Last year, a 34-year-old man in Missouri also received a double lung transplant after developing a life-threatening lung infection that was resistant to antibiotics. The man had a history of smoking cigarettes and also vaped for nine years.
Around 54% of those who receive a lung transplant survive for at least five years after surgery.
Hurbult said Allard will need to spend around six months in Minneapolis so doctors can monitor his progress and make sure he’s tolerating the transplant. But his family anticipates a full recovery.
""He’s going to get his life back,"" Hurbult said. ""We’re going to get our Jackson back.""

2024-02-28T20:08:39.443Z,Marijuana use as little as once per month linked to higher risk of heart attack and stroke,NBC News,"Using marijuana as little as once per month is associated with a higher risk of both heart attack and stroke, according to a large study published Wednesday by researchers from Massachusetts General Hospital. The risks rose sharply the more frequently marijuana was used.
The paper, which was published in the Journal of the American Heart Association, adds to the growing body of evidence suggesting marijuana may be harmful to the cardiovascular system.
Scientists analyzed data on nearly 435,000 patients, ages 18 to 74, to see whether there was a link between marijuana use and a higher risk of heart disease, stroke or heart attack. The data came from a behavioral risk factor survey collected from 2016 to 2020 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Compared with people who had never used marijuana, daily cannabis users had 25% higher likelihood of heart attacks and 42% higher risk of strokes. People who used marijuana just once a week had a 3% increased likelihood of a heart attacks and 5% higher risk of strokes during the study time frame.
The study is among the largest to show a connection between marijuana use and cardiovascular health in people who don’t also smoke tobacco, said lead researcher Abra Jeffers, a data scientist at Massachusetts General Hospital.
Nearly 75% of people in the study reported smoking as the most common way they got high. They also consumed edibles and vaped. The study did not specifically look at the risks of smoking marijuana compared to edibles.
It’s unclear from the paper whether marijuana directly causes heart attacks and strokes or whether people who are already at risk are more likely to use it.
Historically, some have dismissed studies looking at marijuana and heart problems because participants often use both tobacco and marijuana products, making it hard to determine which substance is really to blame, Jeffers said.
Robert Page, a clinical pharmacist who specializes in heart disease at the University of Colorado Skaggs School of Pharmacy, is worried about the emerging connections between marijuana consumption and the heart. Page was the lead author of a comprehensive statement on cannabis released by the American Heart Association in 2020.
“I think we’re beginning to see the same things we saw with smoking cigarettes back in the ’50s and ’60s — that this is a signal,” Page said. “I feel like we’re repeating history.”
Ultimately, it will take more rigorous studies to draw any firm conclusion, he said, which would involve following people for years and monitoring their marijuana use. That type of research is difficult to conduct because marijuana is still a Schedule 1 substance under the Controlled Substances Act.
The new research found that the risks of heart attacks and strokes became higher the more days per month people used marijuana, which is called a “dose-response relationship.”
“If something is really bad or a toxin, you’d expect more of it to be worse,” said Dr. Deepak Bhatt, the director of Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital in New York, who was not involved with the research. “The fact that there’s a dose response makes it seem like it probably is, in fact, the cannabis that is causing the bad outcome.”
The president of the American Heart Association, Dr. Joseph Wu, the director of the Stanford Cardiovascular Institute, drew a comparison to other common substances.
“It’s the same dose response as somebody who smoked tobacco or as somebody who drinks alcohol,” he said. “The more you drink, the more problems you are going to have, because these are toxins.”
Ultimately, the researchers concluded that the people who really should be avoiding marijuana smoking altogether are those with pre-existing heart disease, estimated at 1 in 20 Americans.
That marijuana is associated with heart problems is a very urgent message for Americans to be aware of, Wu said, as 1 in 5 people over age 12 now report having used marijuana in the last year, according to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health.
“Just because something’s been legalized doesn’t mean it’s safe,” he said.
Smoking was the most common way cannabis was consumed in the new paper, although edibles are not necessarily safe, either.
“If you force me to answer I would say not smoking is a better way of consuming it,” Bhatt said. “When you smoke things, that makes them more toxic, but that doesn’t mean that we can say it’s definitely safe to consume it as an edible.”
Laboratory studies have shown that THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, can cause an increase in inflammation in the blood vessels, so edibles aren’t necessarily risk-free, Wu said.
“If you’re smoking marijuana it’s probably doing double the damage compared to just using edibles,” Wu said. “When you eat the edible, the THC goes into your body and can cause vascular inflammation. Whereas when you smoke, there is damage from the particulate matter and then the THC gets absorbed into your body, as well.”
It’s not yet known why smoking marijuana affects the cardiovascular system, but there are a few possibilities, Bhatt said.
A phenomenon called oxidative stress, an imbalance between free radicals and antioxidants in the body, can cause inflammation and damage to blood vessels. Other reasons could include marijuana’s triggering abnormal heart rhythms or even activating platelets, cells in the body that can make blood more likely to clot, leading to a heart attack or stroke.
The paper found that among younger adults, defined as men younger than 55 and women younger than 65, cannabis use was significantly associated with 36% higher combined odds of coronary heart disease, heart attack and stroke, regardless of whether or not they also used traditional tobacco products.
“I’ve seen it through the years with clinical practice many times where sometimes we bang our heads thinking, ‘Why [is] this person in their 20s, or 30s or 40s [coming] in with a heart attack?” Bhatt said. While it can often be attributed to things like extremely high cholesterol or cocaine use, he said, sometimes there’s only one factor they have in common.
“The only thing I can find after asking and asking again and again in terms of potential risk factors is marijuana,” he said. “So the smart thing to do would be not to smoke marijuana, but I realize it’s extremely popular and that’s advice that may not be well received by all.”

2024-02-23T19:33:01.699Z,Pauses on embryo transfers out of Alabama leave IVF patients with few options,NBC News,"Some fertility clinics and shipping services plan to hold off on sending frozen embryos from Alabama to other states as they weigh the legal implications of an Alabama court ruling that says embryos created through in vitro fertilization are children.
Many doctors and patients are confused about which elements of fertility treatment are restricted, following the Alabama Supreme Court decision last week, and at least three Alabama providers have paused IVF services. Some IVF patients have considered moving their embryos out of the state to continue the process elsewhere, only to learn that the option isn't available to them right now.
RESOLVE: The National Infertility Association announced Friday that nationwide embryo shipping services have indicated that they will stop transporting embryos to and from Alabama.
""This slight window of hope for Alabamans currently undergoing IVF to continue their family-building treatment in other states just slammed shut,"" RESOLVE CEO Barbara Collura said in a statement.
At least two IVF providers in Alabama told NBC News they have paused shipping of embryos, as well.
The University of Alabama at Birmingham, which suspended IVF services this week, said Thursday that it is not sending embryos to new locations for now.
“We understand some patients wish to transport their embryos to another facility,” UAB said in a statement. “Companies that transport embryos are also assessing the risks associated with the Alabama Supreme Court ruling, and we are working to identify a company that is able and willing as soon as possible. It is our goal to help patients who are interested in this option do so safely, but — at this time — there are no options available.”
Meghan Cole, a patient at Alabama Fertility in Birmingham, was expecting her embryo to be implanted in a surrogate Friday (Cole has a blood disorder that prevents her from safely carrying a pregnancy). But the appointment was canceled Wednesday night after the clinic decided to pause IVF services.
She inquired about transferring her embryos to an out-of-state facility, but a doctor told her that the practice was worried it would be liable for any potential damage to the embryos during transit, she said.
“Now, even if I wanted to get them out of the state and do a transfer in another state or where my surrogate lives, I can’t,” Cole said. “I’m just kind of stuck until something changes down here, which who knows how long that’s going to take?”
Alabama Fertility did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Dr. Brett Davenport, a reproductive endocrinologist at Fertility Institute of North Alabama, said that even though his practice is continuing IVF services, it isn't shipping embryos, either.
""I’m not actively destroying embryos, nor am I transporting embryos out of state, just because I think that this is very possibly going to be resolved in about a month,"" he said.
The Alabama court found that people can be held legally responsible for the destruction of embryos under the state’s Wrongful Death Act, which says that an unjustified or negligent act that leads to someone’s death is a civil offense. So providers of IVF services and embryo transport now fear legal repercussions if embryos are discarded — a common part of the IVF process, since some embryos can have genetic abnormalities or may no longer be needed.
However, the Alabama Supreme Court's Feb. 16 ruling applied to a unique circumstance: Three couples sued a fertility clinic in Mobile, Alabama, after a person wandered into an unlocked storage area and dropped frozen embryos on the floor. The court ruled that because an embryo is considered a person, the clinic’s failure to secure that storage area violated the state’s Wrongful Death Act.
Legal experts are hesitant to speculate on the broader implications.
""Parents of an embryo that is destroyed can sue the person who destroyed the embryo for wrongful death — that's all this decision said. We'll have to wait and see what may play out later on in the courts if there are subsequent lawsuits seeking to weaponize this opinion to ban IVF,"" said Gail Deady, senior staff attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights.
On Friday, Katherine Robertson, chief counsel for Alabama Attorney General Steven Marshall, said her office “has no intention of using the recent Alabama Supreme Court decision as a basis for prosecuting IVF families or providers.”
The Alabama Legislature could also act to protect IVF. Five Democrats introduced a bill in the Alabama House of Representatives on Thursday that stipulates that embryos outside of a uterus are neither unborn children nor human beings under state law. Republican state Sen. Tim Melson also announced Thursday that he plans to introduce a similar bill clarifying that embryos aren't human lives until they're implanted in the uterus.
It's not clear when fertility clinics might feel comfortable enough to resume normal operations — or whether patients who intended to discard embryos will have to continue paying storage fees in the interim. Storing frozen embryos can cost $350 to $1,000 per year.
Cole said she's sympathetic to her clinic's position, but she's also worried about the potential for spiraling implications of the Alabama ruling.
""The clinic is afraid to even release the embryos to us for transfer to another state. I’m like, ‘Well, theoretically, aren’t you kidnapping my children?’"" she said. ""How far are we taking this? Can I claim them as dependents on my tax return?”

2024-03-14T10:30:40.000Z,A firm that serves kids with autism grew until it had 265 clinics. Then private equity took over.,NBC News,"Like many parents of autistic children, Misty Richard was thrilled in 2017 to find a clinic close to her home in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, that could help her son, Javier Bautista, known as J.J. The facility was operated by the Center for Autism and Related Disorders, a nationwide company that had 265 locations at its peak. Known as CARD, the center specialized in Applied Behavior Analysis, an individualized program that uses reinforcement strategies to help autistic children cope, learn and communicate.
Initially, J.J., now 9, did well at the clinic. But after CARD was acquired by the Blackstone Group in 2018, a prestigious private-equity firm in New York City, Richard said she began to see troubling changes in staffing. Still, she kept her son at the clinic.
Then, in June 2022, J.J. came home one day agitated about thunderstorms, a deep-seated fear for him. The weather was clear, so Richard asked clinic officials if anything had happened with her son that day to stir his distress. After repeated emails asking for details that Richard said the clinic only reluctantly provided, she was shown a video of her son in a therapy session with a staffer flipping the lights on and off in the room, apparently to mimic lightning. In the video, J.J. was visibly upset by the staffer's action, Richard said.
“It’s stressful for me to watch my child be so upset when he had not a care in the world,” Richard told NBC News. Finally, she said, “they tried to say it was part of an emotional lesson to help him identify what he was scared of.”
Richard withdrew J.J. from the facility and filed a complaint with the Louisiana Behavior Analyst Board, reviewed by NBC News, that identified the CARD staff member who had been flicking the lights. On Feb. 21, the Behavior Analyst Board disciplined that person, its website shows, for sending messages “stating her intention to provoke” a client at the clinic and for ignoring the client’s demand “to stop an action that was agitating and provoking the client.” Under a consent decree, the staffer, a behavior analyst, agreed to perform 30 hours of continuing education, reimburse the board $5,000 for costs and not apply to reinstate her lapsed license until January 2025.
A Blackstone spokesman said he could not comment on a particular client but said the firm was “never involved in determining the appropriate course of treatment for patients.” Moreover, Blackstone “expected behavioral therapists and clinical supervisors to adhere to the highest levels of care — and any instance where that did not occur at the local level would be completely unacceptable,” he said.
As autism diagnoses have soared in the U.S. in recent years, an army of businesses have sprung up to serve the children who have received them. In 2020, 1 child in 36 were diagnosed with the condition, up from 1 in 150 in 2000, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. People diagnosed with autism, a neurodevelopmental disorder, typically have trouble with social communication and interactions; some are nonverbal, making it difficult for them to convey their feelings.
Many of the companies swarming the autism services industry are backed by private-equity firms. These entities use borrowed money to buy companies they hope to sell quickly for more than they paid. The industry has taken over a vast array of health care businesses in recent years, even as research has shown that patient care declines at some entities run by private-equity firms. A recent study by academics at Harvard University and the University of Chicago, for example, found that patients at hospitals owned by private-equity firms experienced far more infections and falls. And on March 5, the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Health and Human Services announced an inquiry into private equity and other corporate takeovers of healthcare entities to understand how the transactions might “increase consolidation and generate profits for firms while threatening patients’ health, workers’ safety, quality of care, and affordable health care for patients and taxpayers.”
Among buyouts of autism services companies from 2017 to 2022, 85% were done by private-equity firms, according to Rosemary Batt, a professor at Cornell University’s School of Industrial and Labor Relations. With Eileen Appelbaum, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, Batt co-wrote a study: “Pocketing Money for Special Needs Kids: Private Equity in Autism Services.” The research estimates that some 135 private-equity firms invested in for-profit companies providing ABA therapy. Because these companies are private, it is difficult to determine the total market share the firms control in autism services, but the top 12 private-equity-backed companies employed 30,000 people and controlled almost 1,300 locations nationwide, Batt and Appelbaum found.
The autism services industry generates revenues of $7 billion a year, and Applied Behavior Analysis, the therapy J.J. received at CARD, is the most popular service offered. Typically requiring intensive and costly therapy sessions of up to 40 hours a week, it is covered by private health insurance and Medicaid in all 50 states. A year of ABA treatment can cost up to $60,000 per child, according to the CDC.
When Blackstone bought CARD in 2018, it promised to “expand access to treatment and services for those affected by autism.” But five years later, in May 2023, CARD filed for bankruptcy, having shuttered over 100 facilities in several states, stranding families that were relying on their services.
Blackstone’s spokesman denied that its ownership had caused the quality of care at CARD to decline and said in a statement that the company’s financial straits were the result of “well-documented, industry-wide challenges stemming from the crushing impacts of the pandemic and its aftershocks and insufficient reimbursements from insurers.” He added that nearly 80% of the purchase of CARD “was funded with equity and any debt financing was intended to support the company’s growth.”
The pandemic savaged many health care operations, to be sure, but the increased debt that private-equity firms typically load onto the companies they buy raised the companies' costs, making Covid’s hit even more of a challenge. CARD, for example, went from having no debt to carrying $160 million when it filed for bankruptcy.
Other private-equity-backed autism services providers have restructured, shut down some operations and slashed services in recent years. But among the larger providers backed by private-equity firms, CARD appears to be alone in filing for bankruptcy.
“The private equity people saw the big picture, they saw the dollar signs, the money” in the treatments, said Jon Bailey, emeritus professor and an expert on ABA therapy at the University of South Florida in Tallahassee. “Now they’re discovering they can’t make as much money as they thought they could.”
For ongoing CARD customers, things seem to be improving. The company’s founder, Doreen Granpeesheh, bought back most of its operations last August. A psychologist and board-certified behavior analyst, she told NBC News she’s dedicated to reviving the company’s services.
“A lot of senior clinicians who had been at CARD before and had left over the last five years have now come back,” Granpeesheh said in an interview. “Our goal and our promise to our families is that we are going to put the clinical quality ahead of everything else.”
The Blackstone spokesman said in a statement that returning CARD to its founder was the right thing to do, “so she could keep its existing center-based facilities open for patients.”
Applied Behavior Analysis grew out of research published in 1987 by Ivar Lovaas, a UCLA psychologist. In a study, Lovaas found that nine of 19 children receiving ABA intervention for up to 40 hours a week for two years or more made substantial progress in 10 intellectual and language skills. Subsequent research by others presented similar findings and the industry took off.
Twenty years later, as autism diagnoses were rising nationwide, parents began pushing for ABA therapy and other services to be covered by Medicaid and private insurance. South Carolina and Texas were among the first to mandate coverage in 2007; by 2019, all 50 states were aboard. In 2014, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid stated that Medicaid must cover medically necessary services for autism.
Although there are several treatments for autism related disorders, including speech and occupational therapy, ABA has become the default recommendation made by many pediatricians when autism is diagnosed, experts in the field say. Some other therapies are not covered by insurance in all states — one reason why private-equity firms have focused their buyouts on ABA therapy companies, Batt and Appelbaum say.
Facilities offering ABA services are typically overseen by a board-certified behavior analyst who assesses each child’s needs and develops individual treatment plans. Once enrolled in a program, a child attends therapy sessions conducted by a registered behavior technician based on those needs. While board-certified behavior analysts receive a graduate level certification, registered behavior technicians need only attain a high school diploma, go through a background check and complete 40 hours of training. They are not licensed by the states in which they operate.
Employment in the field has exploded. According to the Behavior Analyst Certification Board, there are 66,339 board-certified behavior analysts in the U.S., up from 16,376 in 2014. The number of registered behavior technicians has also rocketed, up from 328 a decade ago to more than 160,000 today.
Some researchers question ABA therapy’s effectiveness. In 2020, a report from the Department of Defense, which paid $370 million to cover therapy costs for service-members’ children in 2019, found “limited evidence” of better outcomes using ABA therapy.
Private equity’s sizable investments in ABA therapy extend well beyond Blackstone’s purchase of CARD, and these investments across the industry trouble experts in the field. One is Pablo Juarez, a senior associate in pediatrics, psychiatry and behavioral sciences, and special education at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center. He said that behavior analysts tell him parents of autistic children are pushed into paying for 30 to 40 hours of treatment each week because it generates more profits to the clinics. As co-director of TRIAD, the Treatment and Research Institute for Autism Spectrum Disorders at Vanderbilt, Juarez said he sees this practice more among private-equity-backed clinics.
“These clinics are run by businesspeople, and scheduling patients for smaller periods of time is more labor intensive and diminishes profits,” Juarez said. “I have heard from some behavior analysts that although they may suggest 10, 15, 20 hours a week after the assessment of a new child at a clinic, they come back from meeting with clinic managers and say the child is getting 40 hours.”
This was not the case at CARD, Blackstone said, citing an average of 12 hours per patient per week during its ownership.
For the past decade, Bailey of the University of South Florida has run an ABA Ethics hotline, giving him a bird’s-eye view, he said, of problems in the growing industry. Hotline complaints about private-equity-backed companies have been numerous and persistent, Bailey said.
“The original idea was to answer questions, but it quickly moved to complaints about ethics at the company the person worked for,” he said. “People would say, ‘They’ve increased my case load, it’s almost double what it was when I was hired on.’ In order to make more money, the private equity-owned company ups the number of cases, decreases the amount of supervision, and the next thing you know, this is not about treatment, it’s about how many hours we can get.”
Michelle Zeman, a board-certified behavior analyst who is autistic, agrees. “These are financial people who don’t understand the needs of our clients,” she said. “They’re not about helping out the community.”
After private-equity buyouts of ABA centers, staffing, training and supervision at clinics decline, undermining the quality of care, the researchers Batt and Appelbaum found. As a result, they suggest that states implement new minimum client-staff ratios at clinics and increase oversight of the industry.
Other independent research shows a decline in care after private-equity firms buy up health care entities. For example, academic research on nursing homes from 2021 showed 10% higher mortality rates at facilities owned by private-equity firms.
The Blackstone spokesman said clinical training at CARD “significantly increased” during the firm’s ownership. But two employees disputed this. They provided a document showing that in 2016, two years before Blackstone took over, average total training time for behavior technicians at the company was 86 hours, with the training lasting an average of five to six weeks. By 2020, after Blackstone’s takeover, total training time had fallen to 36 hours and the average duration was 15 days, the document showed.
Even though the private-equity experiment with ABA therapy has hit roadblocks, the financial firms continue to target providers for acquisition. Zachary Stevens, a board-certified behavior analyst and the clinical director of Practical Behavior Analysis in Nashville, Tennessee, says that in the recent past he received phone calls and emails every week from private-equity-backed companies hoping to buy his operation. The calls have slowed down a bit, but they still come, and he said he always says no and tries to explain why.
“I tell them: ‘You are asking people who care about other people to conform to a model of therapy that is exploitive of an autism diagnosis,’” he said. “Saying your child needs 30 hours a week of therapy stands on pretty weak ground, but they have taken that and made that the rule of the land for their clinics. They’re creating fast food ABA.”
Elemy is an in-home ABA provider backed by several venture capital firms. Last year, the company pulled out of most of the states it operated in because the centers there were not profitable, laying off staff and abandoning customers. Zeman, the board-certified behavior analyst, said she worked briefly at Elemy and provided NBC News with texts about the downsizing sent to Elemy staff by its founder, Yury Yakubchyk, in 2022.
“After a detailed review, we have decided to focus providing world-class care in the California, Texas and Florida states only as we prioritize on driving long-term company efficiency through better software and process-driven experiences,” one text said.
The downsizing at Elemy “was heartrending” for both customers and staff, Zeman said. “This is a field that should not be about how much money you bring in.”
Elemy did not return phone calls seeking comment.
Meanwhile, Granpeesheh, who founded CARD in 1990 and spent the next 25 years building it into the largest autism services provider in the country, is back at the helm.
Selling to Blackstone in 2018 was a decision she said she made because the firm was “very big, had a lot of resources and during the interview process it felt like they would be good friends, partners who would bring wisdom to the game.”
Granpeesheh remained on the company’s board until early 2022, but said she quit after a series of disagreements with new management about where they were taking the company. During her time on the board, Granpeesheh said the company added costly executives, increased CARD’s debt and struck expensive contracts with third-party providers. The new CEO had no experience in autism services, she said; he had run a kidney dialysis company, his LinkedIn profile confirms. Blackstone noted that the chief clinical officer under its ownership was a longtime CARD employee.
By 2022, the salaries of the company's behavior techs working with clients had not gone up since 2019, she said. Employees started leaving — the average number of behavior techs at each clinic had been 20 when she owned the company, Granpeesheh said, but at the end of Blackstone’s ownership, it had dwindled to 11.
It was during this time that Richard’s son J.J. attended the CARD clinic near Baton Rouge. Granpeesheh said she was sorry about J.J.’s experience there. “I did have a number of parents reach out to me and tell me stories that I would have been pretty upset about if I was in a position to make any kind of change at CARD during those years,” she said.
Blackstone’s spokesman said any changes in the number of behavior techs reflected the impacts of the pandemic.
In July, with CARD in bankruptcy, Granpeesheh bought back most of its operations for $25 million and took on some of its debt. Now overseeing 112 facilities, Granpeesheh is working to rebuild the company; she said she’s hired more than 500 new behavior technicians and taken on 225 new patients.
“You have to watch over the company,” she added. “It is an entity, not an endless bank account.”
In Baton Rouge, J.J. attends a new autism services clinic and is thriving there, his mom said. It is not owned by private equity.

2024-02-15T21:03:14.732Z,CDC may recommend a spring Covid booster for some groups,NBC News,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is considering whether to recommend yet another Covid booster shot this spring, especially for people most at risk for severe complications of the illness.
A spring booster would be the same vaccine that was approved last fall, which was formulated to target the XBB.1.5 subvariant. The vaccine is also very effective against the JN.1 subvariant, which is causing almost all Covid infections in the U.S. right now.
While it's unlikely that the majority of Americans would opt for another dose — just 21.9% of adults received the latest version of the vaccine — experts say that it's critical to make it available sooner rather than later.
""Waiting till the fall, I think, is a mistake,"" said Michael Osterholm, an infectious disease expert and director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. ""We have clear evidence that either vaccine or previous infection probably gives four to six months of relative protection against serious illness, hospitalizations and deaths, but wanes substantially after that.""
Earlier this week, the CDC said it had no immediate plans to pull back on isolation guidelines for people who test positive for Covid.
Advisers to the CDC are expected to vote on whether to recommend a spring Covid booster during a meeting scheduled for Feb. 28, according to a source close to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. It's expected that the panel will focus its discussion on those most vulnerable to Covid, including people age 65 and older and anyone with a weakened immune system, such as organ transplant recipients.
""The discussion will be aimed at the people who are most accepting of public health recommendations,"" said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee. ""The committee, in its rigorous fashion since the question has come up, will be considering a second dose for people at high risk or for people who wish to get it.""
But even some vulnerable groups who usually adhere closely to their doctors' advice to get vaccinations are experiencing vaccine fatigue, said Dr. William Werbel, associate director of epidemiology and quantitative sciences with the Johns Hopkins Transplant Research Center in Baltimore.
""Some people have had seven, eight vaccines,"" Werbel said. ""Transplant recipients would be more receptive and much more likely to follow recommendations, particularly if recommended by the transplant center, but the ceiling is kind of lowered because of this societal fatigue and societal disenchantment with Covid.""
He added that he would recommend a spring booster to his patients if the CDC signs off on one.
Experts generally recommend waiting at least two months after a Covid vaccination or Covid infection before getting another shot, even for high-risk patients.
Vaccination rates are higher for people ages 65 and older, at 42%, according to the CDC. Research shows that people who got the latest booster shot were 54% less likely to be infected with Covid this winter. That level of protection held against the strain found in nearly all circulation of Covid right now: JN.1.
The CDC is not required to follow the advice of its advisory panels, but it usually does.
As of this month, emergency room visits, hospitalizations and deaths from Covid are down, according to the latest CDC data.
""We're lucky that the vaccines are safe,"" Werbel said, ""certainly much safer than getting Covid.""

2024-01-29T20:11:44.593Z,Decades-old human growth hormone treatments linked to five cases of early Alzheimer's,NBC News,"Five patients in the United Kingdom have developed Alzheimer’s disease that appears to be the result of contaminated injections they received as children decades ago, according to a new study that could change the way scientists think about the causes of dementia — and cause anxiety in patients who underwent the same therapy.
All five patients received injections of human growth hormone from cadavers for several years as a treatment for very short stature, according to the study, which was published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine. Scientists extracted the hormone from the cadavers’ pituitary glands, located at the base of the brain.
What the scientists didn’t realize at the time, however, was that in some cases, another substance was extracted as well, contaminating the batches: amyloid-beta protein. This protein is involved in the formation of the hallmark brain plaques seen in Alzheimer’s. Researchers said they can’t fully explain how being exposed to these proteins could trigger the creation of plaques and tangles in the brain that cause Alzheimer’s disease.
Alzheimer’s cases are generally divided into two main groups: cases caused by genetic mutations and those that develop sporadically in the population in people over 65 due to a number of risk factors, such as smoking, obesity and high blood pressure.
The patients in the new study didn’t fit into those two groups. They developed dementia symptoms between ages 38 and 55. None had genetic mutations linked to early-onset dementia, the study found.
The study authors said their findings suggest a possible third way for Alzheimer’s to develop: through contaminated medical products.
Some doctors who regularly treat children for hormone-related issues and who were not involved with the research said they were surprised by the findings.
“This is new information that is not known by the medical community,” said Dr. Kupper Wintergerst, who chairs the American Academy of Pediatrics’ section on endocrinology.
Other doctors said they were concerned that a therapy once regarded as safe has caused so much harm.
“To hear that Alzheimer’s is linked to a medical treatment, that’s disturbing,” said Dr. Dennis Chia, an associate clinical professor of pediatric endocrinology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA.
Christopher Weber, director of global science initiatives at the Alzheimer’s Association, noted that the study was very small. The findings would be more credible if other scientists get similar results in future studies.
Weber said there’s no risk to the general public.
“Alzheimer’s disease is not contagious,” said Weber, who was not involved in the new study. “You can’t catch Alzheimer’s by taking care of someone with Alzheimer’s. Alzheimer’s disease is not transmissible through the air, or by touching or being near someone with Alzheimer’s.”
Still, he said the study’s findings weren’t entirely new.
“We’ve known for a long time that it is possible to create abnormal amyloid buildup — similar to that seen in Alzheimer’s — in the brain of an animal by injecting it with amyloid-beta,” Weber said. “We also transfer human Alzheimer’s genes into animals to initiate abnormal, Alzheimer’s-like processes in their brains.”
Cadaver-derived growth hormone was given to 27,000 children worldwide from 1959 to 1985, according to the new study, including about 7,700 patients in the United States. Doctors used hormones taken from cadavers before a synthetic version became available.
It’s possible that other patients who received cadaver-derived hormones are at higher risk of Alzheimer’s, the study authors said. But they added that they don’t expect to see a huge wave of cases.
“The actual risk of transmission of Alzheimer’s disease in this context is really very low and these are probably going to be very rare cases,” lead study author Dr. John Collinge, a neurologist and the director of the University College London Institute of Prion Diseases, said at a news briefing Thursday.
Collinge said patients should be aware of the potential risk for Alzheimer’s and, if needed, seek out testing and treatment.
“It’s possible that if we catch people at an early stage” of Alzheimer’s, he said, “they may be more amenable to treatments that are becoming available.”
Children being treated for short stature today are not at risk, because doctors have used synthetic growth hormone since 1985.
“I don’t think people should be alarmed,” said Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, a professor emeritus at Children’s National Hospital who specialized in pediatric growth disorders.
Kaplowitz noted that U.S. manufacturers developed a safer way to purify cadaver-derived human growth hormone in 1977, significantly reducing the risk of contamination. Patients treated in the U.S. with cadaver-derived growth hormone after 1977 are likely at very low risk.
“You would have thought that if this were a big problem, we would have a lot of cases by now,” said Kaplowitz, who was not involved in the new study.
Although Collinge and his team’s earlier research suggested that patients who received cadaver-derived growth hormone could be at risk for Alzheimer’s, they began following the patients because of concerns over a different disease: Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, or CJD, a rare and deadly condition that also resulted from contaminated hormone samples.
CJD is a cousin of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, commonly called mad cow disease. More than 250 growth hormone patients have been diagnosed with CJD worldwide.
Doctors believe patients developed CJD because of hormone samples contaminated with prions — little-understood proteins that can trigger normal brain proteins to fold into abnormal shapes. Thirty-five patients treated with cadaver-derived human growth hormone in the U.S. have died from CJD.
For decades, people who had lived in or traveled to the U.K. or other places hit by mad cow disease were banned from donating blood, for fear of passing on the disease. The Food and Drug Administration lifted that ban in 2022.
Collinge said he doesn’t know whether the proteins that appear to have caused Alzheimer’s can be transmitted through blood transfusions or organ donations. A spokeswoman for the American Society of Transplantation said its scientists know of no links between organ transplants and a heightened risk for Alzheimer’s.
“It’s an interesting question,” Collinge said at the news briefing. “It’s not something we’ve looked at.”
Scientists have had evidence for some time that CJD can be transmitted through blood transfusions, and the American Red Cross bars people who received cadaver-derived growth hormone from donating blood.
But an American Red Cross spokesman said in a statement that “there is no scientific evidence” that donated blood can lead to an accumulation of amyloid protein in the body or increase the risk of Alzheimer’s. The Red Cross is in close contact with the FDA and other international health agencies that oversee blood safety to make sure its recommendations include the latest science, spokesman Daniel Parra said.
The new study raises questions about how Alzheimer’s begins. Alzheimer’s may have more in common with CJD than previously suspected, Collinge said.
“This may have important implications for understanding and treating Alzheimer’s disease in the future,” he said in a statement. While there have been no other reported cases of Alzheimer’s acquired through other medical care, the study “should lead us to review measures to prevent accidental transmission via other medical or surgical procedures in order to prevent such cases occurring in the future.”
